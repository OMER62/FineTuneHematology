0,"A 39-year-old woman is evaluated for anemia. Her  laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL,  hematocrit of 23.9%, mean corpuscular volume of  72 fL, mean cell hemoglobin of 25 pg, and mean cell  hemoglobin concentration of 28%. The peripheral  smear is shown in Figure 2. Which of the follow- ing tests is most likely to be abnormal in this patient?  A. Ferritin B. Haptoglobin C. Hemoglobin electrophoresis D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase E. Vitamin B12","The answer is A.  (Chap. 2) This patient with anemia demonstrates a low  mean cell volume, low mean cell hemoglobin, and  low mean cell hemoglobin concentration. The periph- eral smear demonstrates microcytic and hypochromic  cells, which would be expected given these laboratory  findings. In addition, there is marked variation in size   Review and Self-Assessment 753 (anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis). These find- ings are consistent with severe iron-deficiency anemia,  and serum ferritin would be expected to be <10 to   15 Î¼g/L. A low haptoglobin level would be seen in cases  of hemolysis, which can be intravascular or extravascu- lar in origin. In intravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would be expected to show poikilocytosis with  the presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells  [RBCs]). In extravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would typically shows spherocytes. Hemoglo- bin electrophoresis is used to determine the presence of  abnormal hemoglobin variants. Sickle cell anemia is the  most common form and demonstrates sickled RBCs.  Thalassemias are also common inherited hemoglobinop- athies. The peripheral smear in thalassemia often shows  target cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi- ciency leads to oxidant-induced hemolysis with presence  of bite cells or blister cells. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads  to macrocytosis, which is not consistent with this case.","

Answer: A. Ferritin

Explanation:

The patient's low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels suggest anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is normal, but the mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are low, indicating microcytic anemia. The peripheral smear in Figure 2 shows microcytes with hypochromic red blood cells, which is consistent with microcytic anemia.

The most common causes of microcytic anemia are thalassemia and iron deficiency. However, the patient's MCV is not extremely low, and her reticulocyte count is not elevated, which argues against thalassemia.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of microcytic anemia. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. A low ferritin level indicates that the body has a low total iron store. Therefore, the most likely test to be abnormal in this patient is the ferritin test.","A. Ferritin
Explanation: Based on the laboratory results provided, the patient's anemia is microcytic and hypochromic, which is suggestive of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Ferritin is a stable glycoprotein that reflects bone marrow iron stores in the absence of inflammation. In this case, the patient's low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, along with the microcytic and hypochromic findings on the peripheral smear, suggest that her iron stores are likely depleted. Therefore, a low serum ferritin level is most likely to be observed in this patient.

Haptoglobin is a protein that binds free hemoglobin in the blood and helps prevent its oxidative damage. It is often used as a marker of intravascular hemolysis. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to identify different types of hemoglobin, such as hemoglobin A, hemoglobin S, and hemoglobin C. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is",1,1
1,"A 62-year-old man is evaluated for anemia. He has a  hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL (normal hemoglobin value,  15 g/dL), hematocrit of 27.0% (normal hemato- crit, 45%), mean cell volume of 88 fL, mean cell  hemoglobin of 28 pg, and mean cell hemoglobin  concentration of 30%. On peripheral blood smear,  polychromatophilic macrocytes are seen. The retic- ulocyte count is 9%. What is the reticulocyte pro- duction index? A. 0.54 B. 1.67 C. 2.7 D. 4.5 E. 5.4","The answer is C.  (Chap. 2) The reticulocyte index and reticulocyte pro- duction index are useful in the evaluation of anemia to  determine the adequacy of bone marrow response to the  anemia. A normal reticulocyte count is 1â€“2%, and in  the presence of anemia, this would be expected to rise  to more than two to three times the normal value (the  reticulocyte index). The reticulocyte index is calculated  as Reticulocyte count Ã— (Patientâ€™s hemoglobin/Normal  hemoglobin). In this case, the reticulocyte index would  be 5.4%. A second correction is further necessary in this  patient given the presence of polychromatophilic mac- rocytes on peripheral smear. This finding indicates pre- mature release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow  (â€œshift cellsâ€), and thus these cells have a longer life span.  It is recommended to further divide the reticulocyte  index by a factor of 2, which is known as the reticulo- cyte production index. In this case, the value would be  2.7%.","

Answer: C. 2.7

Explanation:

The reticulocyte production index (RPI) is a measure of the percentage increase in reticulocytes per day. It is calculated using the following formula:

RPI = (Reticulocyte count x MCH x MCV) / Hemoglobin

Where:
Reticulocyte count = 9%
MCH = Mean corpuscular hemoglobin = 28 pg
MCV = Mean corpuscular volume = 88 fL
Hemoglobin = 9.0 g/dL

First, we need to convert the reticulocyte count from percentage to absolute count:

Reticulocyte count = 9% x Total red blood cell count

Total red blood cell count can be calculated using the hemoglobin and hematocrit:

Total red blood cell count = Hemoglobin x 10 / Hemoglobin concentration

Hemoglobin concentration = Hemoglobin / Hematocrit

Total red blood cell","
The reticulocyte production index (RPI) is calculated using the following formula: RPI = (reticulocyte count × 100) / (patient hematocrit × 3)

Given the values provided, the patient's reticulocyte count is 9%, so the reticulocyte count × 100 is 900. The patient's hematocrit is 27%, so the patient hematocrit × 3 is 81. The RPI is calculated as:

RPI = 900 / 81 = 11.11

To find the closest answer from the given options, we need to round the RPI to the nearest whole number. The closest option is 1.67, which is not the correct answer. Therefore, none of the given options is the correct answer.

However, it's important to note that the given values and options are not consistent with each other. The patient's hemoglobin value is lower than the normal value, but the mean cell hemoglobin and mean cell hemoglobin concentration values",1,0
2,"You are asked to review the peripheral blood smear  from a patient with anemia (Figure 4). Serum lac- tate dehydrogenase is elevated, and there is hemo- globinuria. This patient is likely to have which  physical examination finding?  A. Goiter B. Heme-positive stools C. Mechanical second heart sound D. Splenomegaly E. Thickened calvarium","The answer is C. (Chap. 2) This blood smear shows fragmented red blood  cells (RBCs) of varying size and shape. In the presence  of a foreign body within the circulation (prosthetic heart  valve, vascular graft), RBCs can become destroyed.  Such intravascular hemolysis will also cause serum lactate  dehydrogenase to be elevated and hemoglobinuria. In  isolated extravascular hemolysis, there is no hemoglobin  or hemosiderin released into the urine. The characteris- tic peripheral blood smear in splenomegaly is the pres- ence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants within  red blood cells). Certain diseases are associated with  extramedullary hematopoiesis (e.g., chronic hemolytic  anemias), which can be detected by an enlarged spleen,  thickened calvarium, myelofibrosis, or hepatomegaly.  The peripheral blood smear may show teardrop cells  or nucleated RBCs. Hypothyroidism is associated with  macrocytosis, which is not demonstrated here. Chronic  gastrointestinal blood loss will cause microcytosis, not  schistocytes.","

Answer: D. Splenomegaly

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (RBCs), leading to anemia and the release of hemoglobin into the circulation. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hemosiderinuria (hemoglobinuria) are common findings in hemolytic anemia.

The spleen plays a crucial role in removing old or damaged RBCs from the circulation. In hemolytic anemia, the spleen may become enlarged due to the increased workload of removing the excess RBCs. Therefore, splenomegaly is a common physical examination finding in patients with hemolytic anemia.

Goiter refers to an enlarged thyroid gland, heme-positive stools indicate the presence of blood in the stool, a mechanical second heart sound is an additional heart sound heard due to abnormal blood flow, and a thickened calvar","
C. Mechanical second heart sound

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hemolytic anemia. A mechanical second heart sound may be heard in patients with hemolytic anemia due to increased blood flow through the heart as a result of the increased production of reticulocytes and red blood cells. This increased blood flow can lead to a more forceful closure of the heart valves, resulting in a louder second heart sound. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Goiter is not related to hemolytic anemia. Heme-positive stools are a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Splenomegaly is a common finding in hemolytic anemia due to the spleen's role in removing damaged red blood cells, but it is not mentioned in the patient's examination. Thickened calvarium is a sign of increased bone density, which is not related to hemolytic anemia.",0,1
3,All of the following are common manifestations of  bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease EXCEPT: A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel B. Epistaxis C. Menorrhagia D. Postpartum hemorrhage E. Spontaneous hemarthrosis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 3) von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inher- ited disorder of platelet adhesion that has several types.  The most common type is inherited in an autosomal  dominant fashion and is associated with low levels of  qualitatively normal von Willebrand factor. As a disorder  primary hemostasis associated with the development of  a platelet plug, VWD is primarily associated with muco- sal bleeding. General bleeding symptoms that are more  common in VWD include prolonged bleeding after  surgery or dental procedures, menorrhagia, postpartum  hemorrhage, and large bruises. However, easy bruising  and menorrhagia are common complaints and are not  specific for VWD in isolation. Factors that raise concern  for VWD in women with menstrual symptoms include  iron-deficiency anemia, need for blood transfusion, pas- sage of clots >1 inch in diameter, and need to change a  pad or tampon more than hourly. Epistaxis is also a very  common occurrence in the general population, but it is  the most common complaint of males with VWD. Con- cerning features of epistaxis that may be more likely to  indicate an underlying bleeding diathesis are lack of sea- sonal variation and bleeding that requires medical atten- tion. Although most gastrointestinal bleeding in indi- viduals with VWD is unrelated to the bleeding diathesis,  VWD types 2 and 3 are associated with angiodysplasia  of the bowel and gastrointestinal bleeding. Spontane- ous hemarthroses or deep muscle hematomas are seen  in clotting factor deficiencies and not seen VWD except  severe VWD with associated decreased factor VIII levels  <5%.","

Answer: E. Spontaneous hemarthrosis

Explanation:
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a genetic disorder that affects the production or function of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein involved in the coagulation cascade. The disease can manifest with various clinical presentations, including mucocutaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis (nosebleeds), menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), and gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly from angiodysplasias, which are abnormal blood vessels in the small intestine. Postpartum hemorrhage, on the other hand, is a complication of childbirth characterized by excessive blood loss, which can be caused by various factors, including coagulation disorders, but is not specifically associated with VWD. Spontaneous hemarthrosis, or bleeding into a joint, is more commonly seen in hemophilia, another inherited coagulation disorder.","
A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel
Explanation: Angiodysplasia of the small bowel is not a common manifestation of bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease. The common manifestations of bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease include epistaxis, menorrhagia, and postpartum hemorrhage, as well as spontaneous hemarthrosis.",1,0
4,"A 68-year-old man is admitted to the intensive  care unit with spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed- ing and hypotension. He has a medical history of  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney  disease stage III. His medications include lisinopril,  amlodipine, sitagliptin, and glimepiride. On initial  presentation, he is in pain and has a blood pressure  of 70/40 mm Hg with a heart rate of 132 beats/ min. His hemoglobin on admission is 5.3 g/dL  and hematocrit is 16.0%. His coagulation studies  demonstrate an aPTT of 64 seconds and a PT of  12.1 seconds (INR 1.0). Mixing studies (1:1) are  performed. Immediately, the aPTT decreases to   42 seconds. At 1 hour, the aPTT is 56 seconds, and  at 2 hours, it is 68 seconds. Thrombin time and  reptilase time are normal. Fibrinogen is also nor- mal. What is the most likely cause of the patientâ€™s  coagulopathy? A. Acquired factor VIII deficiency B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Lupus anticoagulant E. Vitamin K deficiency FIGURE 4 FIGURE 2  Review and Self-Assessment 727","The answer is B.  (Chap. 3) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) measures the integrity of the intrinsic and com- mon coagulation pathways, and as such, is affected by  all of the coagulation factors, except factor VII. The  aPTT reagent contains phospholipids derived from ani- mal or vegetable sources and includes an activator of  the intrinsic coagulation system, such as nonparticulate  ellagic acid or kaolin. The phospholipid reagent fre- quently varies from laboratory to laboratory. Thus, an  aPTT measured in one hospital may differ from another.  Isolated elevations in the aPTT can be related to fac- tor deficiencies, heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors,  lupus anticoagulant, or the presence of a specific fac- tor inhibitor. To differentiate between the presence of  factor deficiencies and inhibitors, mixing studies should  be performed. Mixing studies are performed by mixing  normal plasma and the patientâ€™s plasma in a 1:1 ratio.  The aPTT and prothrombin time (PT) are incubated at   Review and Self-Assessment 754 37oC, and levels are measured immediately and serially  thereafter for about 2 hours. If the cause is an isolated  factor deficiency, the aPTT should correct to normal  values and remain normal throughout the incubation  period. In the presence of an acquired inhibitor, the  aPTT may or may not correct immediately, but upon  incubation, the inhibitor becomes more active, and the  aPTT will progressively prolong. In contrast, the aPTT  does not correct immediately or with incubation in the  presence of lupus anticoagulants. The presence of serious  bleeding in the presence of mixing studies suggesting  an inhibitor should further rule out lupus anticoagu- lant as a cause because the lupus anticoagulant typically  presents with no symptoms or as a thrombotic disorder.  The mixing studies do not, however, eliminate the pres- ence of heparin as a cause of the prolonged aPTT. If  heparin were present, the thrombin time, but not the  reptilase time, would be prolonged. In this scenario,  both values were normal, ruling out the presence of  heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor. Likewise, dis- seminated intravascular coagulation can be ruled out  in the presence of normal fibrinogen levels. In serious  vitamin K deficiency, both the PT and aPTT should be   prolonged.","

Answer: C. Heparin.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation of spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding, hypotension, and a prolonged aPTT with a normal PT and normal mixing studies is consistent with an acquired coagulopathy. The aPTT is prolonged due to the presence of an inhibitor, which is most likely heparin in this case. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease increases the likelihood of heparin exposure, as these conditions are common indications for its use. The normal thrombin time and reptilase time, along with the normal fibrinogen level, further support the diagnosis of heparin-induced coagulopathy.

Acquired factor VIII deficiency, acquired factor VIII inhibitor, lupus anticoagulant, and vitamin K deficiency are other causes of acquired coagulopathy, but they do not fit the clinical presentation in this case. Acquired factor VIII deficiency and acquired factor VIII inhibitor would both result in a prolonged aPTT and a decreased factor VIII level","
C. Heparin

Explanation:
The patient's initial aPTT is prolonged, but it corrects after mixing with normal plasma, indicating that the prolongation is due to a factor present in the patient's plasma that interferes with the assay. The normal thrombin time and reptilase time suggest that this factor is not a heparinoid or direct oral anticoagulant. The normal fibrinogen level rules out a fibrinogen deficiency. Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, as well as his medications, heparin is the most likely cause of the patient's coagulopathy. Heparin contamination of the blood sample can be ruled out because the thrombin time and reptilase time are normal.",0,0
5,"A 54-year-old man is seen in the clinic complaining  of painless enlargement of lymph nodes in his neck.  He has not otherwise been ill and denies fevers,  chills, weight loss, and fatigue. His past medical  history is remarkable for pulmonary tuberculosis  that was treated 10 years previously under directly  observed therapy. He currently takes no medica- tions. He is a heterosexual man in a monogamous  relationship for 25 years. He denies illicit drug use.  He has smoked 1Â½ packs of cigarettes daily since  16 years of age. He works as a logger. On physical  examination, the patient is thin but not ill-appear- ing. He is not febrile and has normal vital signs.  He has dental caries noted with gingivitis. In the  right supraclavicular area, there is a hard and fixed  lymph node measuring 2.5 Ã— 2.0 cm in size. Lymph  nodes <1 cm in size are noted in the anterior cervi- cal chain. There is no axillary or inguinal lymph- adenopathy. His liver and spleen are not enlarged.  Which of the following factors in history or physi- cal examination increases the likelihood that the  lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy? A. Age older than 50 years B. Location in the supraclavicular area C. Presence of a lymph node that is hard and fixed D. Size >2.25 cm2 (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) E. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 4) Lymphadenopathy has many causes, including  infections, immunologic diseases, and malignancy among  others. In the vast majority of cases, the cause of enlarged  lymph nodes is a benign process. In the primary care  practice, fewer than 1% of individuals will have malig- nancy, and in individuals referred for lymphadenopathy,  this number rises only to 16%. Some features on history  and physical examination lead to an increased likelihood  that the cause of lymphadenopathy is infectious. Fevers  and chills are more commonly present in benign respira- tory illness but can be present in malignancy. Thus, fever  is a nonspecific symptom. Likewise, generalized versus  focal lymphadenopathy is also not specific. The site of  lymph node enlargement can be important and raise  the risk of malignancy. The presence of supraclavicular  lymphadenopathy is never normal. These lymph nodes  drain the thoracic cavity and retroperitoneal space and   are most commonly enlarged in malignancy. However,  infectious etiologies can also cause supraclavicular lymph- adenopathy. The size and texture of the lymph nodes  also provide important information. Nodes <1.0 cm Ã—  1.0 cm are almost always benign, but lymph nodes >2.0 cm   in maximum diameter or with an area of 2.25 cm2  (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) are more likely to be malignant. Nodes  containing metastatic cancer tend to be described as  hard, fixed, and nontender. In lymphoma, however,  the nodes can be tender because of rapid enlargement  of the node with subsequent stretching of the capsule of   the lymph nodes. Lymphomatous nodes are also fre- quently described as firm, rubbery, and mobile.","

Answer: E. All of the above.

Explanation:

The patient's age, history of previous tuberculosis, and smoking history increase the likelihood of malignancy. However, the most significant findings on physical examination are the hard and fixed lymph node in the supraclavicular area and the size of the node being greater than 2 cm. These findings are consistent with malignant lymphadenopathy. The size of the node is an important factor because benign lymph nodes are usually mobile and not fixed to underlying structures. The location in the supraclavicular area is also concerning because it is an uncommon site for benign lymphadenopathy. Therefore, all of the factors listed increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy.","E. All of the above

Explanation:
The patient's age, the location of the lymph node, its hard and fixed nature, and its size all increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy. The context information indicates that more than 98% of enlarged lymph nodes in the primary care setting are nonmalignant, but 50% of patients referred to a specialist for lymphadenopathy are found to have malignant disease. The patient's age puts him at a higher risk for malignancy, and the location of the lymph node in the supraclavicular area suggests a higher likelihood of malignancy compared to inguinal or axillary lymph nodes. The hard and fixed nature of the lymph node is also suggestive of malignancy, as is its size of >2.25 cm2 (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm). Therefore, all of these factors increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy.",1,1
6,"A 24-year-old woman presents for a routine  checkup and complains only of small masses in her  groin. She states that they have been present for at  least 3 years. She denies fever, malaise, weight loss,  and anorexia. She works as a sailing instructor and  competes in triathlons. On physical examination,  she is noted to have several palpable 1-cm inguinal  lymph nodes that are mobile, nontender, and dis- crete. There is no other lymphadenopathy or focal  findings on examination. What should be the next  step in management? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis C. Excisional biopsy D. Fine-needle aspiration for culture and cytopathology E. Pelvic ultrasonography F. Reassurance","The answer is F.  (Chap. 4) This patientâ€™s lymphadenopathy is benign.  Inguinal nodes smaller than 2 cm are common in the  population at large and need no further workup pro- vided that there is no other evidence of disseminated  infection or tumor and that the nodes have qualities that  do not suggest tumor (not hard or matted). A practi- cal approach would be to measure the nodes or even  photograph them if visible and follow them serially over  time. Occasionally, inguinal lymph nodes can be associ- ated with sexually transmitted diseases. However, these  are usually ipsilateral and tender, and evaluation includes  bimanual examination and appropriate cultures, not nec- essarily pelvic ultrasonography. A total-body CT scan  would be indicated if other pathologic nodes suggestive  of lymphoma or granulomatous disease are present in  other anatomic locations. Bone marrow biopsy would  be indicated only if a diagnosis of lymphoma is made  first.","

Answer: C. Excisional biopsy

Explanation:

The presence of palpable, mobile, and discrete inguinal lymph nodes in a young, otherwise healthy woman raises the possibility of a benign reactive process, such as tuberculosis or a bacterial infection. However, the history of their persistence for 3 years and the absence of other symptoms or physical findings suggest a malignancy, such as lymphoma or leukemia.

The first step in the evaluation of this patient should be an excisional biopsy of the lymph nodes. This will provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be insufficient for a definitive diagnosis and may lead to false-negative results. A bone marrow biopsy is not indicated at this time, as there are no other signs or symptoms of hematologic malignancy. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis would be used to evaluate for metastatic disease if a malignancy is diagnosed. Reassurance is not appropriate given the size and persistence of the lym","
F. Reassurance

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with benign reactive lymphadenopathy. The absence of constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, and anorexia, along with the mobility, nontenderness, and discreteness of the inguinal lymph nodes, make malignancy less likely. The patient's age, occupation, and participation in triathlons do not increase her risk for malignancy. Therefore, the next step in management should be reassurance and observation, with follow-up as needed. If the lymph nodes persist or grow in size, further evaluation, such as imaging or biopsy, may be considered. However, given the benign clinical presentation, a more invasive approach, such as a bone marrow biopsy, is not indicated at this time.",0,1
7,All of the following diseases are associated with  massive splenomegaly (spleen extends 8 cm below  the costal margin or weighs >1000 g) EXCEPT: A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension D. Marginal zone lymphoma E. Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 4) Portal hypertension causes splenomegaly via  passive congestion of the spleen. It generally causes only  mild enlargement of the spleen because expanded varices  provide some decompression for elevated portal pres- sures. Myelofibrosis necessitates extramedullary hemato- poiesis in the spleen, liver, and even other sites such as  the peritoneum, leading to massive splenomegaly caused  by myeloid hyperproduction. Autoimmune hemolytic  anemia requires the spleen to dispose of massive amounts  of damaged red blood cells, leading to reticuloendothe- lial hyperplasia and frequently an extremely large spleen.  Chronic myeloid leukemia and other leukemias and  lymphomas can lead to massive splenomegaly caused by  infiltration with an abnormal clone of cells. Marginal  zone lymphoma typically presents with splenomegaly. If  a patient with cirrhosis or right heart failure has mas- sive splenomegaly, a cause other than passive congestion  should be considered.","

Answer: C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension

Explanation:

Massive splenomegaly is a common feature in various hematological and non-hematological conditions. In hematological disorders, it is often due to the accumulation of abnormal cells in the spleen.

A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: This condition is characterized by the production of autoantibodies that destroy the patient's own red blood cells. The spleen plays a role in removing the damaged red blood cells, leading to splenomegaly.

B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: This is a type of cancer of the white blood cells. The spleen becomes enlarged due to the accumulation of abnormal lymphocytes.

D. Marginal zone lymphoma: This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that originates from the marginal zone of the lymph nodes or the spleen. Splenomegaly is a common feature of this condition.

E. Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplas","
C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension

Explanation:
The text states that splenomegaly occurs in patients with cirrhosis when increased portal pressure causes venous engorgement and disruption of the normal splenic architecture. Therefore, cirrhosis with portal hypertension is a cause of massive splenomegaly. The other options listed in the query, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, marginal zone lymphoma, and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, are all associated with splenomegaly but not specifically with massive splenomegaly.",1,1
8,"The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bod- ies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood  cells in a patient with hairy cell leukemia before  any treatment intervention implies which of the  following? A. Diffuse splenic infiltration by tumor B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) C. Hemolytic anemia D. Pancytopenia E. Transformation to acute leukemia","The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear  remnants), Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin), baso- philic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) in  the peripheral blood implies that the spleen is not properly  clearing senescent or damaged RBCs from the circula- tion. This usually occurs because of surgical splenectomy  but is also possible when there is diffuse infiltration of  the spleen with malignant cells. Hemolytic anemia can  have various peripheral smear findings depending on the  etiology of the hemolysis. Spherocytes and bite cells are  an example of damaged RBCs that might appear because  of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and oxidative dam- age, respectively. Disseminated intravascular coagulation  is characterized by schistocytes and thrombocytopenia  on smear with an elevated international normalized ratio   Review and Self-Assessment 755 and activated partial thromboplastin time as well. How- ever, in these conditions, damaged RBCs are still cleared  effectively by the spleen. Transformation to acute leuke- mia does not lead to splenic damage.","

Answer: A. Diffuse splenic infiltration by tumor

Explanation:

Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a type of chronic B-cell leukemia characterized by the presence of hairy-appearing adhered lymphocytes in the bone marrow and spleen. These cells are called hairy cells due to their long, cytoplasmic projections.

The laboratory findings mentioned in the question, such as the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells, are all indicative of hemolysis or the destruction of red blood cells.

However, these findings are not typically associated with DIC, hemolytic anemia, or pancytopenia in the context of hairy cell leukemia. Instead, they are more commonly seen due to the splenic sequestration of red blood cells and their destruction by the spleen, which is a hallmark feature of hairy cell leukemia.

Therefore, the presence of these findings in a patient with hairy cell leuk","C. Hemolytic anemia

Explanation:
The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells in a patient with hairy cell leukemia before any treatment intervention suggests hemolytic anemia. Howell-Jolly bodies are the remnants of the nuclei of ruptured red blood cells, Heinz bodies are denatured hemoglobin, basophilic stippling is the presence of basophilic granules in the red blood cells, and nucleated red blood cells are immature red blood cells with a visible nucleus. These findings indicate that there is ongoing hemolysis in the patient. Hairy cell leukemia is characterized by the presence of hairy cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, which can cause pancytopenia due to bone marrow suppression. However, the presence of these specific red blood cell inclusions suggests hemolytic anemia as an additional complication. Diffuse splenic infiltration by tumor would typically present with splenomegaly and monocytopenia, disse",1,0
9,Which of the following is true regarding infection  risk after elective splenectomy? A. Patients are at no increased risk of viral infection  after splenectomy. B. Patients should be vaccinated 2 weeks after splenec- tomy. C. Splenectomy patients over the age of 50 are at great- est risk for postsplenectomy sepsis. D. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly impli- cated organism in postsplenectomy sepsis. E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases  with time.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) Splenectomy leads to an increased risk of  overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, an infection  that carries an extremely high mortality rate. The most  commonly implicated organisms are encapsulated. Strep- tococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and sometime  gram-negative enteric organisms are most frequently  isolated. There is no known increased risk for any viral  infections. Vaccination for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae,  and Neisseria meningitidis is indicated for any patient who  may undergo splenectomy. The vaccines should be  given at least 2 weeks before surgery. The highest risk  of sepsis occurs in patients younger than 20 years of age  because the spleen is responsible for first-pass immunity,  and younger patients are more likely to have primary  exposure to implicated organisms. The risk is highest  during the first 3 years after splenectomy and persists at a  lower rate until death.","

Answer: E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases with time.

Explanation: Splenectomy, or the surgical removal of the spleen, is a common procedure performed for various reasons, including trauma, hematological disorders, and certain types of cancer. The spleen plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the production of antibodies and the removal of old or damaged red blood cells. After splenectomy, patients may be at an increased risk of certain types of infections, especially encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

The risk of infection after splenectomy increases with time due to the gradual decline in the production of antibodies and other immune factors. This is why it is recommended that patients receive vaccinations against these types of bacteria before splenectomy, if possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all splenectomized patients receive pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines, as well as an annual","E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases with time.

Explanation:
The text states that the incidence of sepsis after splenectomy is highest in the first 1 to 3 years after the procedure, but infections can occur as late as 50 years after the procedure. This indicates that the risk of infection increases with time. The text also mentions that patients with asplenia or hyposplenia are at risk for infections due to encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus. These bacteria are common causes of sepsis, and the text mentions that patients with asplenia are at risk for severe infections due to intracellular pathogens such as Babesia, Bartonella, and Plasmodia species. Therefore, options A, B, D, and the statement that ""Patients are at no increased risk of viral infection after splenectomy"" are incorrect. Option C, ""Splenectomy patients over the age of ",0,0
10,"An 18-year-old man is seen in consultation for a  pulmonary abscess caused by infection with Staph- ylococcus aureus. He had been in his usual state of  health until 1 week ago when he developed fevers  and a cough. He has no ill contacts and presents in  the summer. His medical history is significant for  episodes of axillary and perianal abscesses requiring  incision and drainage. He cannot specifically recall  how often this has occurred, but he does know it has  been more than five times that he can recall. In one  instance, he recalls a lymph node became enlarged  to the point that it â€œpoppedâ€ and drained sponta- neously. He also reports frequent aphthous ulcers  and is treated for eczema. On physical examination,  his height is 5â€²3â€³. He appears ill with a temperature  of 39.6Â°C. Eczematous dermatitis is present in the  scalp and periorbital area. There are crackles at the  left lung base. Axillary lymphadenopathy is present  bilaterally and is tender. The spleen in enlarged.

Granulomatous inflammation is seen on lymph   Review and Self-Assessment 728    node biopsy. Which of the following tests are most  likely found in this patient? A. Elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level B. Eosinophilia C. Giant primary granules in neutrophils D. Mutations of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor E. Positive nitroblue tetrazolium dye test","The answer is E.  (Chap. 5) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an  inherited disorder of abnormal phagocyte function. Sev- enty percent of cases are inherited in an X-linked fashion  with the other 30% being autosomal recessive. Affected  individuals are susceptible to infectious with catalase- positive organisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus. Other  organisms that can be seen include Burkholderia cepacia,  Aspergillus spp., and Chromobacterium violaceum. Most  individuals present in childhood, and infections com- monly affect the skin, ears, lungs, liver, and bone. Exces- sive inflammatory reaction can lead to suppuration of  lymph nodes, and granulomatous inflammation can be  seen on lymph node biopsy and found in the gastro- intestinal and genitourinary tracts. Aphthous ulcers and  eczematous skin rash can also be seen. The underlying  genetic defect in CGD is the inability of neutrophils and  monocytes to generate the appropriate oxidative burst in  response to infectious organisms. Several mutations can  lead to the disease, and these affect one of the five sub- units of the NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) oxidase enzyme. The test of choice to  diagnose chronic granulomatous disease is the nitroblue  tetrazolium dye test, which demonstrates lack of super- oxide and hydrogen peroxide production in the face of  an appropriate stimulus.","

Answer: C. Giant primary granules in neutrophils

Explanation:

The patient's history of recurrent abscesses, frequent aphthous ulcers, and eczema are consistent with a diagnosis of recurrent infections due to a primary immunodeficiency disorder, specifically, neutrophilic cytokine response syndrome (NCRS) or chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). NCRS is a rare variant of CGD, characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, eczema, and eosinophilia. However, in this case, the patient's laboratory studies show neutrophilia, not eosinophilia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is CGD.

CGD is caused by mutations in the genes that encode for the components of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme complex, which is responsible for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) during phagocytosis. This leads to impaired bacterial killing and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections.

C. Giant primary granules in neutrophils

Explanation:
The patient's history of recurrent abscesses, axillary lymphadenopathy, and eczema, along with the physical examination findings of crackles at the left lung base, axillary lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, suggest a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). CGD is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the inability of phagocytes to generate reactive oxygen intermediates, leading to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of giant primary granules in neutrophils on a peripheral blood smear. Therefore, the most likely test to be found in this patient is C.

A chest radiograph demon- strates a new lobar infiltrate. Laboratory measure- ments reveal a total white blood cell count of 12,100  cells/Î¼L with a neutrophilic predominance of 86%  and 8% band forms. He is diagnosed with commu- nity-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotic treatment  is initiated. Under normal, or â€œnonstress,â€ condi- tions, what percentage of the total body neutrophils  are present in the circulation? A. 2% B. 10% C. 25% D. 40% E. 90%","The answer is A.  (Chap. 5) Under normal or nonstress conditions, roughly  90% of the neutrophil pool is in the bone marrow, 2â€“3%  in the circulation, and the remainder in the tissues. The  circulating pool includes the freely flowing cells in the  bloodstream and the others are marginated in close prox- imity to the endothelium. Most of the marginated pool is  in the lung, which has a vascular endothelium surface area.  Margination in the postcapillary venules is mediated by  selectins that cause a low-affinity neutrophilâ€“endothelial  cell interaction that mediates â€œrollingâ€ of the neutrophils  along the endothelium. A variety of signals, including  interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor Î±, and other che- mokines, can cause leukocytes to proliferate and leave  the bone marrow and enter the circulation. Neutrophil  integrins mediate the stickiness of neutrophils to endo- thelium and are important for chemokine-induced cell  activation. Infection causes a marked increase in bone  marrow production of neutrophils that marginate and  enter tissue. Acute glucocorticoids increase neutrophil  count by mobilizing cells from the bone marrow and  marginated pool.","

Answer: C. 25%

Explanation: Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cells in the human body, making up approximately 50-60% of the total white blood cell count under normal conditions. However, only about 25% of the total body neutrophils are present in the circulation at any given time. The rest are located in various tissues throughout the body, particularly in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver. In response to infection or inflammation, neutrophils are mobilized from these sites and enter the bloodstream, leading to an increase in the percentage of neutrophils in the peripheral blood. In this patient's case, the high neutrophil count and percentage in the peripheral blood suggest an active infection or inflammatory process.","
The normal percentage of neutrophils in the circulation under nonstress conditions is approximately 40% to 60%. Therefore, the answer is D. However, it's important to note that the percentage of neutrophils in the circulation can increase under stress conditions, such as infection or inflammation, and can reach up to 70% or more. In this case, the patient has a neutrophilic predominance of 86%, which is higher than the normal range under nonstress conditions. This suggests that the patient is experiencing some form of stress or infection, which could explain the increase in neutrophils in the circulation.",0,0

Which of the  following new drugs would most likely explain this  patientâ€™s neutropenia? A. Darunavir B. Efavirenz C. Ranitidine D. Prednisone E. Trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole","The answer is E.  (Chap. 5) Many drugs can lead to neutropenia, most  commonly via retarding neutrophil production in   the bone marrow. Of the list in the answer choices, tri- methoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole is the most likely culprit.  Other common causes of drug-induced neutropenia  include alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or  busulfan, antimetabolites including methotrexate and  5-flucytosine, penicillin and sulfonamide antibiotics,  antithyroid drugs, antipsychotics, and anti-inflammatory  agents. Prednisone, when used systemically, often causes  an increase in the circulating neutrophil count because  it leads to demargination of neutrophils and bone mar- row stimulation. Ranitidine, an H2 blocker, is a well- described cause of thrombocytopenia but has not been  implicated in neutropenia. Efavirenz is a nonnucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor whose main side effects  include a morbilliform rash and central nervous system  effects, including strange dreams and confusion. The  presence of these symptoms does not require drug ces- sation. Darunavir is a new protease inhibitor that is well  tolerated. Common side effects include a maculopapu- lar rash and lipodystrophy, a class effect for all protease  inhibitors.","

Answer: E. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole

Explanation:

The patient's initial neutrophil count of 90% and subsequent neutropenia with only 5% neutrophils suggests a drug-induced cause. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole is a common cause of drug-induced neutropenia. It is often used for opportunistic infection prophylaxis in HIV patients. The other options, darunavir, efavirenz, and prednisone, are not known to cause significant neutropenia.","
C. Ranitidine
Explanation:
The patient's initial WBC count was 3200 cells/Î¼L with 90% neutrophils, but 2 weeks later, his WBC count dropped to 900 cells/Î¼L with 5% neutrophils. This significant decrease in neutrophil count suggests the development of neutropenia. The patient was started on several medications during his hospitalization, including ranitidine. Ranitidine is a histamine-2 (H2) blocker commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers. It has been reported to cause agranulocytosis, a condition characterized by the absence of neutrophils in the blood, in rare cases. Therefore, ranitidine is the most likely explanation for the patient's neutropenia.

The other options, such as darunavir, efavirenz, prednisone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, are less likely to cause neutropenia. Darunavir is an ant",1,0
13,All the following are suggestive of iron-deficiency  anemia EXCEPT: A. Koilonychia B. Pica C. Decreased serum ferritin D. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) E. Low reticulocyte response,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 7) Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition con- sisting of anemia and clear evidence of iron deficiency.  It is one of the most prevalent forms of malnutrition.  Globally, 50% of anemia is attributable to iron deficiency  and accounts for approximately 841,000 deaths annu- ally worldwide. Africa and parts of Asia bear 71% of the  global mortality burden; North America represents only  1.4% of the total morbidity and mortality associated with  iron deficiency. Initially, a state of negative iron balance  occurs during which iron stores become slowly depleted.  Serum ferritin may decrease, and the presence of stain- able iron on bone marrow preparation decreases. When   Review and Self-Assessment 756 iron stores are depleted, serum iron begins to fall. Total  iron-binding capacity (TIBC) starts to increase, reflecting  the presence of circulating unbound transferrin. When  the transferrin saturation falls to 15â€“20%, hemoglobin  synthesis is impaired. The peripheral blood smear reveals  the presence of microcytic and hypochromic red blood  cells. Reticulocytes may also become hypochromic.  Reticulocyte numbers are reduced relative to the level  of anemia, reflecting a hypoproduction anemia second- ary to iron deficiency. Clinically, these patients exhibit  the usual signs of anemia, which are fatigue, pallor, and  reduced exercise capacity. Cheilosis and koilonychia are  signs of advanced tissue iron deficiency. Some patients  may experience pica, a desire to ingest certain materials,  such as ice (pagophagia) and clay (geophagia).","

Explanation:

Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition where the body does not have enough iron to produce sufficient hemoglobin, leading to a decrease in red blood cell production. The following symptoms and laboratory findings are commonly associated with iron-deficiency anemia:

1. Microcytic, hypochromic anemia: Microcytic means that the red blood cells are smaller than normal, and hypochromic means that they are paler than normal. This is due to the decreased amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.
2. Pallor: Pallor is the paleness of the skin, mucous membranes, and the conjunctiva due to the decreased number of red blood cells.
3. Fatigue: Fatigue is a common symptom of anemia, as the body's tissues are not getting enough oxygen due to the decreased number of red blood cells.
4. Shortness of breath: Shortness of breath can occur due to the decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
5. Tachycardia: Tachycardia is an increased","
D. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)

14,A 24-year-old man with a history of poorly treated  chronic ulcerative colitis is found to have ane- mia with a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and a reduced  mean corpuscular volume. His ferritin is 250 Î¼g/L.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of  his anemia? A. Folate deficiency B. Hemoglobinopathy C. Inflammation D. Iron deficiency E. Sideroblastic anemia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) (See Table 7-4.) The differential diagnosis of  microcytic anemia includes iron deficiency, hemoglo- binopathy (e.g., thalassemia), myelodysplastic syndromes  (including sideroblastic anemia), and chronic inflamma- tion. Inflammation can be distinguished from iron defi- ciency because iron deficiency typically includes a very  low ferritin level (<50 Î¼g/L) and iron binding satura- tion, but in inflammation, they are normal or increased.  Any chronic inflammatory state may cause a hypopro- liferative anemia caused by inadequate marrow utiliza- tion of iron related to hyperproduction of a number of  cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon- gamma, and interleukin-1. The anemia of chronic dis- ease may be normocytic/normochromic or microcytic.  Serum iron and iron binding are normal to high in  thalassemia and sideroblastic anemia. Folate deficiency  causes macrocytic anemia.","

Answer: D. Iron deficiency.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of chronic ulcerative colitis, low hemoglobin level, reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and low ferritin level are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic gastrointestinal diseases such as ulcerative colitis due to blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract. Folate deficiency anemia is characterized by a low MCV and high red blood cell (RBC) count, while hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders that affect the structure and function of hemoglobin. Inflammation can contribute to anemia by reducing the production of red blood cells or increasing their destruction, but it is not the most likely cause in this case. Sideroblastic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by the ineffective production of red blood cells due to a defect in the last step of hemoglobin synthesis, and it is not typically associated with a low MCV and low ferritin level.","D. Iron deficiency
Explanation: The patient's history of chronic ulcerative colitis and low ferritin level (<15 Î¼g/L is diagnostic of iron deficiency in premenopausal women) are strong indicators of iron deficiency anemia. The other options, such as folate deficiency, hemoglobinopathy, inflammation, and sideroblastic anemia, do not fit the clinical scenario.",0,0
15,All of the following statements regarding the ane- mia of chronic kidney disease are true EXCEPT: A. The degree of anemia correlates with the stage of  chronic kidney disease. B. Erythropoietin levels are reduced. C. Ferritin is reduced. D. It is typically normocytic and normochromic. E. Reticulocytes are decreased.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is  usually associated with a moderate to severe hypoprolif- erative anemia. The level of the anemia correlates with  the stage of CKD. Red blood cells (RBCs) are typically  normocytic and normochromic, and reticulocytes are  decreased. The anemia is primarily caused by a failure  of erythropoietin (EPO) production by the diseased kid- ney and a reduction in RBC survival. Polycystic kidney  disease shows a smaller degree of EPO deficiency for a  given level of renal failure. By contrast, patients with  diabetes or myeloma have more severe EPO deficiency  for a given level of renal failure. Assessment of iron sta- tus provides information to distinguish the anemia of  CKD from other forms of hypoproliferative anemia  and to guide management. Patients with the anemia of  CKD usually present with normal serum iron, total iron- binding capacity, and ferritin levels. However, those  maintained on chronic hemodialysis may develop iron  deficiency from blood loss through the dialysis proce- dure. EPO therapy is effective in correcting the anemia  of CKD. Iron must be replenished in patients with con- comitant iron deficiency to ensure an adequate response  to EPO therapy.","

Answer: E. Reticulocytes are increased.

Explanation:

Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and its severity increases as the disease progresses. The anemia of CKD is typically characterized by a microcytic, hypochromic appearance due to decreased production of normal erythrocytes and increased destruction of erythrocytes.

A. The degree of anemia correlates with the stage of chronic kidney disease: This statement is true. Anemia is a common complication of CKD, and its severity increases as the disease progresses.

B. Erythropoietin levels are reduced: This statement is true. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells. In CKD, the kidneys are unable to produce enough EPO to meet the body's demands, leading to anemia.

C. Ferritin is reduced: This statement is false. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. In","
C. Ferritin is reduced.

Explanation:
The anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to a deficiency in erythropoietin (EPO) production, which is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells. The anemia is typically normocytic and normochromic, meaning the red blood cells are of normal size and color. Reticulocytes, which are immature red blood cells, are decreased. The degree of anemia can correlate with the stage of chronic kidney disease, and it is often accompanied by a low serum iron level, normal or decreased transferrin (or TIBC), and decreased transferrin saturation. However, serum ferritin levels are often elevated due to the presence of inflammation and chronic disease, not reduced. Therefore, statement C is not true.",0,1
16,All of the following statements regarding the utility  of hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease  are true EXCEPT: A. It is effective in reducing painful crises. B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production  of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow. C. It should be considered in patients with repeated  acute chest syndrome episodes. D. Its mechanism involves increasing production of fetal  hemoglobin. E. The major adverse effect is a reduction in white  blood cell count.,"The answer is B. (Chap. 8, MM Hsieh et al: N Engl J Med 2009;361:2309â€“2317)  The most significant recent advance in the therapy of  sickle cell anemia has been the introduction of hydroxy- urea as a mainstay of therapy for patients with severe  symptoms. Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin and  may exert beneficial effects on red blood cell (RBC)  hydration, vascular wall adherence, and suppression of  the granulocyte and reticulocyte counts. Hemoglobin  F levels increase in most patients within a few months.  Hydroxyurea should be considered in patients experienc- ing repeated episodes of acute chest syndrome or with  more than three crises per year requiring hospitaliza- tion. The utility of this agent for reducing the incidence  of other complications (priapism, retinopathy) is under  evaluation, as are the long-term side effects. Hydroxy- urea offers broad benefits to most patients whose disease  is severe enough to impair their functional status, and it  may improve survival. The main adverse effect is a reduc- tion in white blood cell (WBC) count; dosage should  be titrated to maintain a WBC count at 5000 to 8000/ Î¼L. WBCs and reticulocytes may play a major role in  the pathogenesis of sickle cell crisis, and their suppression  may be an important benefit of hydroxyurea therapy. A  recent study demonstrated that nonmyeloablative bone  marrow transplantation in patients with sickle cell dis- ease could produce a stable chimera that corrected RBC  counts and reversed the sickle cell phenotype.","

Answer: E. The major adverse effect is not a reduction in white blood cell count.

Explanation:
Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used in the management of sickle cell disease. It works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in the bone marrow, which can help reduce the frequency and severity of painful crises, acute chest syndrome, and other complications associated with sickle cell disease. The medication does not have a significant effect on white blood cell count, and its major adverse effects include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disturbances, and teratogenicity. Therefore, statement E is incorrect.","
B. It is effective in reducing painful crises. A, C, D, and E are true.
Explanation:
From the context, we know that hydroxyurea is effective in reducing painful crises (A), recurrent acute chest syndrome episodes (C), and increasing fetal hemoglobin production (D). The mechanism of action for hydroxyurea involves inhibiting the production of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the bone marrow, which leads to an increase in fetal hemoglobin production. The major adverse effect of hydroxyurea is a reduction in white blood cell count (E). Statement B is incorrect as hydroxyurea does not produce a chimeric state with partial production of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow.",0,1
17,Which of the following is the most cost-effective  test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin  (vitamin B12) deficiency? A. Red blood cell folate B. Serum cobalamin C. Serum homocysteine D. Serum methylmalonate E. Serum pepsinogen  Review and Self-Assessment 729,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 9) Serum cobalamin is measured by an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay test and is the most cost- effective test to rule out deficiency. Normal serum  levels are typically above 200 ng/L. In patients with  megaloblastic anemia caused by cobalamin deficiency,  the level is usually <100 ng/L. In general, the more  severe the deficiency, the lower the serum cobalamin  level. In patients with spinal cord damage caused by the  deficiency, levels are very low even in the absence of  anemia. Borderline low levels may occur in pregnancy  in patients with megaloblastic anemia caused by folate  deficiency. In patients with cobalamin deficiency suf- ficient to cause anemia or neuropathy, the serum meth- ylmalonate (MMA) level is increased. Serum MMA and  homocysteine levels have been proposed for the early  diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency even in the absence of  hematologic abnormalities or subnormal levels of serum  cobalamin. Serum MMA levels fluctuate, however, in  patients with renal failure. Mildly elevated serum MMA  or homocysteine levels occur in up to 30% of apparently  healthy volunteers and 15% of elderly subjects. These  findings bring into question the exact cutoff points for   Review and Self-Assessment 757 normal MMA and homocysteine levels. It is also unclear  at present whether these mildly increased metabolite lev- els have clinical consequences. Serum homocysteine is  increased in both early cobalamin and folate deficiency  but may also be increased in other conditions (e.g.,  chronic renal disease; alcoholism; smoking; pyridoxine  deficiency; hypothyroidism; and therapy with steroids,  cyclosporine, and other drugs). The red blood cell folate  assay is a test of body folate stores. It is less affected than  the serum assay by recent diet and traces of hemolysis.  Subnormal levels occur in patients with megaloblastic  anemia caused by folate deficiency but also in nearly  two-thirds of patients with severe cobalamin deficiency.  False-normal results may occur if a folate-deficient  patient has received a recent blood transfusion or if a  patient has an increased reticulocyte count. Serum pep- sinogen may be low in patients with pernicious anemia.","

Answer: C. Serum homocysteine

Explanation:

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency can lead to various hematologic and neurologic manifestations. The diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency can be challenging due to the complex interplay of various nutritional and metabolic factors. The following tests are commonly used to evaluate suspected cobalamin deficiency:

1. Serum cobalamin: This test measures the total amount of cobalamin in the serum. However, it is an insensitive test for detecting early or mild cobalamin deficiency because it reflects the total body stores of cobalamin. False-positive results can also occur in the presence of certain medications, such as methotrexate, and in certain conditions, such as pregnancy and renal failure.
2. Red blood cell folate: This test measures the folate levels in the red blood cells. Folate deficiency can coexist with cobalamin deficiency, and folate supplementation can mask the diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency. Therefore, a normal red blood cell folate level does not rule out cobalamin deficiency","C. Serum homocysteine

Explanation:
The most cost-effective test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin deficiency is serum homocysteine. While serum cobalamin levels are the gold standard for diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, they are not always reliable due to the presence of interfering factors such as high levels of antibodies against intrinsic factor in patients with pernicious anemia. Serum homocysteine and methylmalonate levels are more sensitive indicators of early cobalamin deficiency and can be elevated before cobalamin levels fall below the lower limits of the normal range. Additionally, measuring both homocysteine and methylmalonate levels can improve the diagnostic yield. While red blood cell folate and serum pepsinogen levels may be useful in certain clinical contexts, they are not the most cost-effective tests for evaluating suspected cobalamin deficiency.",0,0
18,A patient being evaluated for anemia has the periph- eral blood smear shown in Figure 20. Which of  the following is the most likely cause of the anemia?  A. Acute lymphocytic leukemia B. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13 C. Cobalamin deficiency D. Epstein-Barr virus infection E. Iron deficiency,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 9) The peripheral blood smear shows hypochro- masia, macrocytosis, and a hypersegmented (>five lobes)  neutrophil. These findings are typical for a megaloblastic  anemia as seen in cobalamin or folate deficiency. The  mean corpuscular volume is typically >100 fL, and there  is significant anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. There may  also be leukopenia and thrombocytopenia that corre- late with the degree of deficiency. Other less common  causes of megaloblastic anemia include therapy with  drugs that interfere with folate metabolism (methotrex- ate) or DNA synthesis (hydroxyurea, AZT, cytosine  arabinoside, 6-mercaptopurine) and some cases of acute  myeloblastic leukemia or myelodysplasia. Autoantibod- ies to ADAMTS-13 are associated with thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura, which causes a microangio- pathic hemolytic anemia. Epstein-Barr virus infection is  associated with large atypical lymphocytes, not hyper- segmented neutrophils. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  microcytic hypochromic anemia.","

Answer:

Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine the cause of the anemia based on the given peripheral blood smear alone. However, I can provide some information about each of the options and the characteristics of the anemia that might be suggestive of each cause.

A. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL): This is a type of cancer of the white blood cells, specifically the lymphocytes. The peripheral blood smear in this case would typically show an increased number of immature white blood cells, called blast cells, and a decreased number of normal red blood cells, leading to anemia. However, the figure provided does not show any evidence of blast cells or other features suggestive of ALL.

B. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13: ADAMTS-13 is a protein that plays a role in the breakdown of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the blood. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13 can cause a condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is characterized","
Based on the information provided in the context, the most likely cause of the anemia is not clear without additional information. The peripheral blood smear in Figure 20 shows agglutinated RBCs, which is suggestive of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). However, the DAT (Coombs test) was negative for immunoglobulin G (IgG) but positive for complement (3+), which is not consistent with classic AIHA. The patient also had a monoclonal IgMκ protein in the serum protein electrophoresis, which raises the possibility of a lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Therefore, further evaluation with additional tests such as bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, flow cytometry, and immunoglobulin levels would be necessary to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.

Therefore, the answer is: E. Insufficient information to determine the cause of the anemia.",0,0
19,Patients from which of the following regions need  not be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydro- genase (G6PD) deficiency when starting a drug that  carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis? A. Brazil B. Russia C. Southeast Asia D. Southern Europe E. Sub-Saharan Africa F. None of the above,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) Red blood cells (RBCs) use glutathione  produced by the hexose monophosphate shunt to com- pensate for increased production of reactive oxygen spe- cies (oxidant stress), usually induced by drugs or toxins.  Defects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)  are the most common congenital hexose monophos- phate shunt defect. If the RBC is unable to maintain  an adequate level of glutathione during oxidant stress,  hemoglobin precipitates in the RBC, producing Heinz  bodies. Because the G6PD gene is on the X chromo- some, almost all affected patients are males. G6PD defi- ciency is widely distributed throughout regions that are  currently or were once highly malarial endemic. It is  common in males of African, African American, Sardin- ian, and Sephardic descent. In most persons with G6PD  deficiency, there is no evidence of symptomatic disease.  However, infection, ingestion of fava beans, or exposure  to an oxidative agent (drug or toxin) can trigger an acute  hemolytic event. Bite cells, Heinz bodies, and bizarre  poikilocytes may be evident on smear. The drugs that  most commonly precipitate a G6PD crisis include dap- sone, sulfamethoxazole, primaquine, and nitrofurantoin.  The anemia is often severe with rapid onset after drug  ingestion, and renal failure can occur.","

Answer: C. Southeast Asia

Explanation:
G6PD deficiency is a common X-linked inherited disorder that affects approximately 400 million people worldwide. It is most common in areas with high prevalence, including Africa, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. However, among these regions, Southeast Asia is the only one where the prevalence is not high enough to warrant universal screening for G6PD deficiency before administering drugs that may cause hemolysis in affected individuals. This is because the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Southeast Asia is relatively low compared to other regions, such as Africa and the Mediterranean. Therefore, it is recommended to screen individuals from Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East for G6PD deficiency before administering drugs that may cause hemolysis, but screening is not necessary for individuals from Southeast Asia unless there is a personal or family history of the condition or other risk factors.","
Explanation: Based on the context information, it appears that individuals from Southern Europe, specifically those with the G6PD /C0Mediterranean variant, are at risk for severe hemolysis when exposed to oxidant stress or certain drugs. Therefore, patients from Southern Europe should be screened for G6PD deficiency before starting a drug that carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis. The other regions listed in the query, Brazil, Russia, and Southeast Asia, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa, have significant populations with G6PD deficiency and should be screened accordingly.

On initial evalua- tion, she is tachycardic and hypotensive, appears  pale, is dyspneic, and is somewhat difficult to  arouse. Physical examination reveals splenomegaly.  Her initial hemoglobin is 6 g/dL, white blood cell  count is 6300/Î¼L, and platelets are 294,000/Î¼L.  Her total bilirubin is 4 g/dL, reticulocyte count  is 18%, and haptoglobin is not detectable. Renal  function is normal, as is urinalysis. What would you  expect on her peripheral blood smear? A. Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes  with hypersegmented nuclei B. Microspherocytes C. Schistocytes D. Sickle cells E. Target cells","The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) This patientâ€™s lupus and her rapid develop- ment of truly life-threatening hemolytic anemia are  both very suggestive of autoimmune hemolytic ane- mia. Diagnosis is made by a positive Coombs test result  documenting antibodies to the red cell membrane, but  smear will often show microspherocytes, indicative of  the damage incurred to the red cells in the spleen. Schis- tocytes are typical for microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mias such as hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura. The lack of thrombocyto- penia makes these diagnoses considerably less plausible.  Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes with  hypersegmented nuclei are very suggestive of vitamin  B12 deficiency, which causes more chronic, nonâ€“life- threatening anemia. Target cells are seen in liver disease  and thalassemias. Sickle cell anemia is associated with  aplastic crises, but this patient has no known diagnosis of  sickle cell disease and is showing evidence of erythropoi- etin response based on the presence of elevated reticu- locyte count.","

Answer: C. Schistocytes

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hemolytic anemia, which is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. The reticulocyte count is elevated, indicating ongoing hemopoiesis to compensate for the hemolysis. The haptoglobin is not detectable, indicating significant intravascular hemolysis. The peripheral blood smear would show evidence of hemolysis, such as schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells. Macrocytosis would be seen in megaloblastic anemia, microspherocytes in hemolytic anemia with spherocytosis, and sickle cells in sickle cell anemia. Target cells are typically seen in conditions such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, or in conditions with increased cholesterol levels, such as multiple myeloma or hyperlipidemia.","
C. Schistocytes

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hemolytic anemia. The absence of haptoglobin and the presence of reticulocytes suggest intravascular hemolysis. Schistocytes, also known as ""fragmented red blood cells,"" are a sign of intravascular hemolysis. They form when red blood cells are fragmented as they pass through the spleen or other organs, such as the liver. This can occur in various conditions, including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this case, the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus increases the likelihood of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia as a cause of her symptoms. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Schistocytes.",0,0
21,"A 22-year-old pregnant woman of northern Euro- pean descent presents 3 months into her first preg- nancy with extreme fatigue, pallor, and icterus. She  reports being previously healthy. On evaluation,  her hemoglobin is 8 g/dL with a normal mean cor- puscular volume and an elevated mean corpuscu- lar hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count  of 9%, and indirect bilirubin of 4.9 mg/dL; serum  haptoglobin is not detectable. Her peripheral smear  is shown in Figure 23. Her physical examination  is notable for splenomegaly and a normal 3-month  uterus. What is the most likely diagnosis?  A. Colonic polyp B. G6PD deficiency C. Hereditary spherocytosis D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","The answer is C.  (Chap. 10) The peripheral blood smear shows micro- spherocytes, small densely staining red blood cells  (RBCs) that have lost their central pallor characteris- tic of hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytosis is almost  the only condition with an increased mean corpuscular  hemoglobin concentration. Hereditary spherocytosis is a  heterogeneous RBC membranopathy that can be either  congenital (usually autosomal dominant) or acquired; it  is characterized by predominantly extravascular hemo- lysis in the spleen caused by defects in membrane struc- tural proteins. This spleen-mediated hemolysis leads to  the conversion of classic biconcave RBCs on smear to  spherocytes. Splenomegaly is common. This disorder  can be severe, depending on the site of mutation, but  is often overlooked until some stressor such as preg- nancy leads to a multifactorial anemia, or an infection  such as parvovirus B19 transiently eliminates RBC pro- duction altogether. Acute treatment is with transfusion.  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency  is a cause of hemolysis that is usually triggered by the  presence of an offending oxidative agent. The peripheral  blood smear may show Heinz bodies. Parvovirus infec- tion may cause a pure RBC aplasia. The presence of  active reticulocytosis and laboratory findings consistent   Review and Self-Assessment 758 with hemolysis are not compatible with that diagnosis.  Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, such as caused by a  colonic polyp, would cause a microcytic, hypochromic  anemia without evidence of hemolysis (indirect biliru- bin, haptoglobin abnormalities).","

Answer: D. Parvovirus B19 infection

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of extreme fatigue, pallor, and icterus, along with her laboratory findings of a low hemoglobin level, reticulocytosis, and elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are consistent with hemolytic anemia. The absence of haptoglobin and the peripheral smear findings of target cells, spherocytes, and burr cells are also consistent with hemolysis. Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of hemolytic anemia during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. It is a single-stranded DNA virus that infects erythrocytes and can lead to hemolysis and reticulocytosis. The patient's ethnicity is also relevant as Parvovirus B19 is more common in northern European populations. Colonic polyp, G6PD deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are less likely causes of the","
C. Hereditary spherocytosis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, pallor, icterus, and splenomegaly, along with her ethnicity and laboratory findings, such as a low hemoglobin level, normal mean corpuscular volume, elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count, and indirect bilirubin level, are consistent with hereditary spherocytosis. This condition is relatively common among patients of Northern European descent and is characterized by abnormal RBC shape and shortened RBC survival due to a deficiency or dysfunction of one or more membrane proteins. The peripheral smear shows spherocytes, which are small, spherical RBCs with a loss of central pallor, indicating hemolysis. The absence of haptoglobin in the serum is also indicative of hemolysis. Hereditary spherocytosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild anemia to severe hemolysis and splenomegaly. The diagnosis is typically confirmed through genetic testing,",0,1
22,"The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis,  and pancytopenia suggests which of the following   diagnoses? A. Acute promyelocytic leukemia B. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) C. Leptospirosis D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) FIGURE 23 FIGURE 20  Review and Self-Assessment 730","The answer is D. (Chap. 10) Each of the listed diagnoses has a rather char- acteristic set of laboratory findings that are virtually diag- nostic for the disease once the disease has progressed to a  severe stage. The combination of portal vein thrombo- sis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is typical for paroxysmal  nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare disor- der characterized by hemolytic anemia (particularly at  night), venous thrombosis, and deficient hematopoiesis.  It is a stem cellâ€“derived intracorpuscular defect. Ane- mia is usually moderate in severity, and there is often  concomitant granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.  Venous thrombosis occurs much more commonly than  in the population at large. The intraabdominal veins are  often involved, and patients may present with Budd- Chiari syndrome. Cerebral sinus thrombosis is a com- mon cause of death in patients with PNH. The presence  of pancytopenia and hemolysis should raise suspicion for  this diagnosis even before the development of a venous  thrombosis. In the past, PNH was diagnosed by abnor- malities on the Ham or sucrose lysis test; however, cur- rently flow cytometry analysis of glycosylphosphati- dylinositol (GPI) linked proteins (e.g., CD55 and CD59)  on red blood cells and granulocytes is recommended.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) both cause hemolysis  and thrombocytopenia, as well as fevers. Cerebrovascu- lar events and mental status change occur more com- monly in TTP, and renal failure is more common in  HUS. Severe leptospirosis, or Weilâ€™s disease, is notable  for fevers, hyperbilirubinemia, and renal failure. Con- junctival suffusion is another helpful clue. Acute promy- elocytic leukemia is notable for anemia, thrombocytope- nia, and either elevated or a decreased white blood cell  count, all in the presence of disseminated intravascular  coagulation.","

Answer: E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

Explanation:
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a microangiopathic disorder characterized by thrombosis in the small vessels, hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia. The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is a common presentation in TTP. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the presence of promyelocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, hemolysis is not a typical feature. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a microangiopathic disorder characterized by hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, but portal vein thrombosis is not a common feature. Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that can cause hemolysis, jaundice, and thrombocytopenia, but pancytopenia is not a typical feature","C. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)

Explanation:
The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is a common finding in Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). HUS is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, often accompanied by renal impairment. The pathophysiology of HUS involves the formation of microthrombi in the small vessels of multiple organs, leading to hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. The most common form of HUS is associated with bloody diarrhea and is caused by enteric infection with Shiga-like toxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli. The atypical form of HUS occurs without a diarrheal prodrome and is associated with a higher incidence of end-stage kidney disease and mortality. Both forms of HUS can present with portal vein thrombosis.

23,All of the following laboratory values are consistent  with an intravascular hemolytic anemia EXCEPT: A. Increased haptoglobin B. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) C. Increased reticulocyte count D. Increased unconjugated bilirubin E. Increased urine hemosiderin,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 10) Haptoglobin is an Î±-globulin normally pres- ent in serum. It binds specifically to the globin portion of  hemoglobin, and the complex is cleared by the mono- nuclear cell phagocytosis. Haptoglobin is reduced in all  hemolytic anemias because it binds free hemoglobin. It  can also be reduced in cirrhosis and so is not diagnostic of  hemolysis outside of the correct clinical context. Assum- ing normal bone marrow and iron stores, the reticulo- cyte count will be elevated as well to try to compensate  for the increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction of  hemolysis. Release of intracellular contents from the  RBC (including hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase)  induces heme metabolism, producing unconjugated bili- rubinemia. If the haptoglobin system is overwhelmed,  the kidney will filter free hemoglobin and reabsorb it in  the proximal tubule for storage of iron by ferritin and  hemosiderin. Hemosiderin in the urine is a marker of fil- tered hemoglobin by the kidneys. In massive hemolysis,  free hemoglobin may be excreted in urine.","

Explanation:

An intravascular hemolytic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) within the intravascular space. This results in the release of hemoglobin and other components of RBCs into the circulation.

A. Increased haptoglobin: Haptoglobin is a protein in the blood that binds free hemoglobin. In the presence of intravascular hemolysis, haptoglobin levels would be decreased, not increased, as it binds to the excess free hemoglobin.

B. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): LDH is an enzyme that is released when cells are damaged or destroyed. In the case of intravascular hemolysis, RBCs are being destroyed, so LDH levels would be increased.

C. Increased reticulocyte count: Reticulocytes are immature RBCs that contain RNA and are larger than mature RBCs. In response to anemia, the bone marrow produces more","
A. Increased haptoglobin

Explanation:
Intravascular hemolytic anemia is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells within the intravascular space. The released hemoglobin from the ruptured red blood cells enters the plasma and is eventually excreted in the urine, leading to red urine and pink plasma. The increased hemolysis results in an increase in plasma bilirubin and LDH levels, as well as a decrease in plasma haptoglobin levels due to the binding of free hemoglobin. The reticulocyte count is also elevated due to the bone marrow's response to the increased demand for new red blood cells. In contrast, urine hemosiderin is a sign of chronic intravascular hemolysis, and its presence indicates that the hemolysis has been ongoing for an extended period. Therefore, the correct answer is A, increased haptoglobin, as haptoglobin levels are decreased in intravascular hemolytic anemia.",1,1
24,Which of the following hemolytic anemias can be  classified as extracorpuscular? A. Elliptocytosis B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria C. Pyruvate kinase deficiency D. Sickle cell anemia E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 10) Hemolytic anemias may be classified as intra- corpuscular or extracorpuscular. In intracorpuscular  disorders, the patientâ€™s red blood cells (RBCs) have an  abnormally short life span because of an intrinsic RBC  factor. In extracorpuscular disorders, the RBC has a  short life span because of a nonintrinsic RBC factor.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an  acquired disorder in which red blood cell and platelet  destruction occur not because of defects of these cell  lines but rather as a result of microangiopathy leading  to destructive shear forces on the cells. Other clinical  signs and symptoms include fever; mental status change;  and, less commonly, renal impairment. Most acquired  adult cases of TTP are associated with autoantibodies to  ADAMTS-13 (or von Willebrand factorâ€“cleaving pro- tease). All cases of hemolysis in conjunction with throm- bocytopenia should be rapidly ruled out for TTP by  evaluation of a peripheral smear for schistocytes because  plasmapheresis is lifesaving. Other causes of extravascular  hemolytic anemia include hypersplenism, autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagula- tion, and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.  The other four disorders listed in the question all refer  to some defect of the RBC itself that leads to hemo- lysis. Elliptocytosis is a membranopathy that leads to   varying degrees of destruction of the RBC in the reticu- loendothelial system. Sickle cell anemia is a congenital  hemoglobinopathy classified by recurrent pain crises and  numerous long-term sequelae that is caused by a well- defined Î²-globin mutation. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is a rare disorder of the glycolytic pathway that causes  hemolytic anemia. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin- uria (PNH) is a form of acquired hemolysis caused by an  intrinsic abnormality of the RBCs. It also often causes  thrombosis and cytopenias. Bone marrow failure is a  feared association with PNH.","

Answer: E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

Explanation:

Hemolytic anemias are a group of disorders characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) leading to anemia. The causes of hemolytic anemias can be intracorpuscular (intrinsic to the RBCs) or extracorpuscular (extrinsic to the RBCs).

Extracorpuscular hemolytic anemias are caused by factors outside the RBCs that trigger their destruction. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an example of an extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia. TTP is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction. The underlying cause of TTP is a deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13, which leads to the formation of microthrombi in small blood vessels. These","
B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired intrinsic RBC disorder, but it is classified as an extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia because it is caused by the absence of certain glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins on the surface of the RBCs, making them susceptible to complement-mediated lysis.

Explanation:
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired intrinsic RBC disorder caused by a somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene, which encodes for glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. These proteins are essential for the regulation of complement and prevent complement-mediated lysis of the RBCs. In PNH, the absence of these proteins on the RBC surface makes them susceptible to complement-mediated lysis, leading to intravascular hemolysis. However, since the cause of hemolysis is extracorpuscular (the complement system), PNH is classified as an extracorpuscular hem",1,0
25,"A 34-year-old woman with a medical history of sickle  cell anemia presents with a 5-day history of fatigue,  lethargy, and shortness of breath. She denies chest  pain and bone pain.

(Chap. 11) Pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA) is a con- dition characterized by the absence of reticulocytes and  erythroid precursors. A variety of conditions may cause  PRCA. It may be idiopathic. It may be associated with  certain medications, such as trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethox- azole (TMP-SMX) and phenytoin. It can be associated  with a variety of neoplasms, either as a precursor to a  hematologic malignancy such as leukemia or myelo- dysplasia or as part of an autoimmune phenomenon,   Review and Self-Assessment 759 as in the case of thymoma. Infections also may cause  PRCA. Parvovirus B19 is a single-strand DNA virus that  is associated with erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease  in children. It is also associated with arthropathy and a  flulike illness in adults. It is thought to attack the P anti- gen on proerythroblasts directly. Patients with a chronic  hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell disease, or with an  immunodeficiency are less able to tolerate a transient  drop in reticulocytes because their red blood cells do not  survive in the peripheral blood for an adequate period.  In this patient, her daughter had an illness before the  appearance of her symptoms. It is reasonable to check  her parvovirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers. If the  results are positive, a dose of intravenous Ig is indicated.  Because her laboratory test results and smear are not  suggestive of dramatic sickling, an exchange transfusion  is not indicated. Immunosuppression with prednisone,  cyclosporine, or both may be indicated if another etiol- ogy of the PRCA is identified. However, that would  not be the next step. Similarly, a bone marrow trans- plant might be a consideration in a young patient with  myelodysplasia or leukemia, but there is no evidence of  that at this time. Antibiotics have no role in light of her  normal white blood cell count and the lack of evidence  for a bacterial infection.","

Answer: C. Check parvovirus titers.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, lethargy, and shortness of breath, along with a marked decrease in hemoglobin level and absence of reticulocytes, suggest a severe sickle cell crisis with aplastic crisis. The absence of reticulocytes indicates that the bone marrow is not responding to the crisis by producing new red blood cells.

The most common cause of aplastic crisis in sickle cell disease is parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded RNA virus that infects erythroid precursor cells and can cause a transient aplastic crisis. The virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets or contact with infected blood or saliva. The patient's recent exposure to her sick 4-year-old daughter, who had a ""cold,"" increases the likelihood of parvovirus B19 infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate next management step is to check parvovirus titers to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment,","
C. Check parvovirus titers.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and bone marrow biopsy results are consistent with aplastic anemia, likely caused by parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of aplastic anemia, particularly in children and young adults. The absence of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood and the normal myeloid series in the bone marrow biopsy are key findings in the diagnosis of parvovirus-induced aplastic anemia. The most appropriate next management step is to check parvovirus titers to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment, such as intravenous immunoglobulin or supportive care, if necessary. Exchange transfusion and bone marrow transplant are not indicated in this case, as the patient's condition is likely to be self-limiting with appropriate treatment. Prednisone and cyclosporine are not indicated for parvovirus-induced aplastic anemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are not necessary, as there is no evidence of infection.",1,1
26,Aplastic anemia has been associated with all of the  following EXCEPT: A. Carbamazepine therapy B. Methimazole therapy C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Seronegative hepatitis,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) Aplastic anemia is defined as pancytopenia  with bone marrow hypocellularity. Aplastic anemia  may be acquired, iatrogenic (chemotherapy), or genetic  (e.g., Fanconiâ€™s anemia). Acquired aplastic anemia may  be caused by drugs or chemicals (expected toxicity or  idiosyncratic effects), viral infections, immune diseases,   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, pregnancy, or  idiopathic causes. Aplastic anemia from idiosyncratic  drug reactions (including those listed as well others,  including as quinacrine, phenytoin, sulfonamides, or  cimetidine) are uncommon but may be encountered  given the wide usage of some of these agents. In these  cases, there is usually not a dose-dependent response;  the reaction is idiosyncratic. Seronegative hepatitis is a  cause of aplastic anemia, particularly in young men who  recovered from an episode of liver inflammation 1 to  2 months earlier. Parvovirus B19 infection most com- monly causes pure red blood cell (RBC) aplasia, particu- larly in patients with chronic hemolytic states and high  RBC turnover (e.g., sickle cell anemia).","

Answer: C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Explanation: Aplastic anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the production of all three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can be caused by various factors, including infections, medications, and autoimmune disorders.

Carbamazepine and methimazole are medications that have been linked to the development of aplastic anemia. Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat epilepsy and trigeminal neuralgia. Methimazole is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. Both of these drugs can cause aplastic anemia as a side effect.

Parvovirus B19 is a viral infection that can cause aplastic anemia, particularly in individuals with underlying conditions such as sickle cell disease or other types of anemia.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a class of medications used to reduce pain, inflammation, and fever. They do","

Which of the following is the best therapy? A. Antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine B. Glucocorticoids C. Growth factors D. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant E. Red blood cell and platelet transfusion","The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) This patient has aplastic anemia. In the absence  of drugs or toxins that cause bone marrow suppression,  it is most likely that he has an immune-mediated injury.  Growth factors are not effective in the setting of hypoplas- tic bone marrow. Transfusion should be avoided unless  emergently needed to prevent the development of allo- antibodies. Glucocorticoids have no efficacy in aplastic  anemia. Immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin  and cyclosporine is a therapy with proven efficacy for this  autoimmune disease with a response rate of up to 70%.  Relapses are common, and myelodysplastic syndrome  or leukemia may occur in approximately 15% of treated  patients. Immunosuppression is the treatment of choice  for patients without suitable bone marrow transplant  donors. Bone marrow transplantation is the best current  therapy for young patients with matched sibling donors.  Allogeneic bone marrow transplants from matched sib- lings result in long-term survival in more than 80% of  patients, with better results in children than adults. The  effectiveness of androgens has not been verified in con- trolled trials, but occasional patients will respond or even  demonstrate blood count dependence on continued ther- apy.

For patients with moderate disease  or those with severe pancytopenia in whom immunosup- pression has failed, a 3 to 4-month trial is appropriate.","

Answer: D. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Explanation:

The patient's presentation of diffuse bruising, pallor, and low platelet count with a hypocellular bone marrow is consistent with a diagnosis of aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow failure. The etiology of aplastic anemia is often idiopathic, but it can also be caused by certain medications, infections, or toxins.

The patient's negative history for any prior illnesses, medications, dietary supplements, and illicit drug use, along with normal chromosome studies, makes an idiopathic cause more likely.

The best treatment for aplastic anemia depends on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to initial therapy. For severe cases, such as this patient's with a platelet count below 20,000/Î¼L, the recommended treatment is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from a","E. Red blood cell and platelet transfusion
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diffuse bruising, low hemoglobin level, and low platelet count suggest a bleeding disorder. The bone marrow biopsy showing hypocellularity with a fatty marrow further supports this diagnosis. The exclusion of Fanconi's anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome from the chromosome studies narrows down the possibilities to a non-malignant cause of the patient's symptoms. The best therapy in this situation would be to provide red blood cell and platelet transfusions to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications. Antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine are used for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, glucocorticoids are used for various hematologic and non-hematologic conditions, and growth factors are used to stimulate the production of blood cells in certain conditions.",1,0

Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of can- cer treatment, usually with a combination of radiation  and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as busul- fan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period  of 5â€“7 years) or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors   (2 years). Both acquired aplastic anemia after immuno- suppressive treatment and Fanconiâ€™s anemia can evolve  into MDS. MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell dis- order leading to impaired cell proliferation and differen- tiation. Cytogenetic abnormalities are found in approxi- mately half of patients, and some of the same specific  lesions are also seen in frank leukemia. Anemia dominates  the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain  of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea,  and pallor, but at least half of patients are asymptomatic,  and their MDS is discovered only incidentally on routine  blood counts. Previous chemotherapy or radiation expo- sure is an important historic fact. Fever and weight loss  should point to a myeloproliferative rather than myelo- dysplastic process. About 20% of patients have spleno- megaly. Bone marrow is typically hypercellular. Median  survival varies from months to years, depending on the  number of blasts in marrow and the specific cytogenetic  abnormality. Isolated 5q- is associated with a median  survival in years. Most patients die as a result of com- plications of pancytopenia and not because of leukemic    Review and Self-Assessment 760 transformation; perhaps one-third succumb to other dis- eases unrelated to their MDS. Precipitous worsening of  pancytopenia, acquisition of new chromosomal abnor- malities on serial cytogenetic determination, increase in  the number of blasts, and marrow fibrosis are all poor  prognostic indicators. The outlook in therapy-related  MDS, regardless of type, is extremely poor, and most  patients progress within a few months to refractory acute  myeloid leukemia. Historically, the therapy of MDS has  been unsatisfactory. Only stem cell transplantation offers  cure. Survival rates of 50% at 3 years have been reported,  but older patients are particularly prone to develop treat- ment-related mortality and morbidity. Results of trans- plant using matched unrelated donors are comparable,  although most series contain younger and more highly  selected cases. However, multiple new drugs have been  approved for use in MDS. Several regimens appear to  not only improve blood counts but also to delay onset of  leukemia and to improve survival.  Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative with a more  favorable toxicity profile, is particularly effective in  reversing anemia in MDS patients with 5q- syndrome;  a high proportion of these patients become transfusion  independent.","

Answer: B. He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and worsening handicap, along with the laboratory findings of a low hematocrit, low platelet count, and the presence of 5q-cytogenetic abnormality, are consistent with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), specifically 5q-syndrome. Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of bone marrow disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of leukemia.

The statement that ""He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation"" is not true for this patient. While there is an increased risk of leukemic transformation in patients with MDS, the median survival for 5q-syndrome is around 10-15 years, and many patients can live much longer. The median survival for patients with a hematocrit below 30% is around 5-7 years, but this can be improved with","B. He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation.
Explanation: Based on the given information, the patient's condition is consistent with a diagnosis of MDS with a 5q-cytogenetic abnormality. While the risk of leukemic transformation is higher in MDS, it is not the most likely cause of death for this patient, especially given his age and lack of other significant medical history. The median survival for MDS with a 5q-cytogenetic abnormality is typically greater than 12 months. Therefore, options B and C are not correct. Lenalidomide is not effective in reversing anemia in MDS, but it can be used to treat some subtypes of MDS and improve symptoms. Stem cell transplantation is a curative option for some patients with MDS, but it is not the only option and is not necessarily the best option for all patients. Therefore, option E is not entirely correct either. The correct answer is B, as the patient is not most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation based on the given information.",1,1
29,All of the following are considered myeloprolif- erative disorders in the WHO classification system  EXCEPT: A. Chronic myeloid leukemia (bcr-abl positive) B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Mastocytosis D. Polycythemia vera E. Primary effusion lymphoma  Review and Self-Assessment 731,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) The World Health Organizationâ€™s classifica- tion of the chronic myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs)  includes eight disorders, some of which are rare or  poorly characterized but all of which share an origin in a  multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell, overproduc- tion of one or more of the formed elements of the blood  without significant dysplasia, a predilection to extramed- ullary hematopoiesis or myelofibrosis, and transforma- tion at varying rates to acute leukemia. Within this broad  classification, however, significant phenotypic hetero- geneity exists. Some diseases such as chronic myeloid  leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL),  and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) express pri- marily a myeloid phenotype, but in others, such as poly- cythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and  essential thrombocytosis (ET), erythroid or megakaryo- cytic hyperplasia predominates. The latter three disor- ders, in contrast to the former three, also appear capable  of transforming into each other. Such phenotypic het- erogeneity has a genetic basis. CML is the consequence  of the balanced translocation between chromosomes   9 and 22 (t[9;22][q34;11]), CNL has been associated with  a t(15;19) translocation, and CEL occurs with a deletion  or balanced translocations involving the PDGFR-alpha  gene. By contrast, to a greater or lesser extent, PV, PMF,  and ET are characterized by expression of a JAK2 muta- tion, V617F, that causes constitutive activation of this  tyrosine kinase that is essential for the function of the  erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors but not  the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. This  essential distinction is also reflected in the natural history  of CML, CNL, and CEL, which is usually measured in  years, and their high rate of transformation into acute  leukemia. By contrast, the natural history of PV, PMF,  and ET is usually measured in decades, and transforma- tion to acute leukemia is uncommon in the absence of  exposure to mutagenic agents. Primary effusion lym- phoma is not a myeloproliferative disease. It is one of  the diseases (Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, multicentric Castlemanâ€™s  disease) associated with infection with human herpes  virus-8, particularly in immunocompromised hosts.","

Answer: D. Primary effusion lymphoma

Explanation: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of clonal hematologic disorders characterized by the overproduction of one or more myeloid lineages. The five main types of MPNs are:

1. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
2. Polycythemia vera (PV)
3. Essential thrombocythemia (ET)
4. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
5. Mast cell disease (Mastocytosis)

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily involves body cavities, such as the pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal spaces. It is not considered a myeloproliferative disorder, as it is not characterized by the overproduction of myeloid cells. Instead, it is associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection and is classified as a type of Kaposi sarcoma","
E. Primary effusion lymphoma
Explanation:
The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) as a group of stem cell–derived clonal disorders characterized by the proliferation of one or more components of the myeloid lineage. The given options include Chronic myeloid leukemia (bcr-abl positive), Essential thrombocytosis, Mastocytosis, and Polycythemia vera. Primary effusion lymphoma is not a myeloproliferative disorder, but rather a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the presence of malignant cells in body fluids, such as pleural or pericardial effusions.",0,1
30,Which of the following statements regarding poly- cythemia vera is correct? A. An elevated plasma erythropoietin level excludes the  diagnosis. B. Transformation to acute leukemia is common. C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic  risk. D. Aspirin should be prescribed to all of these patients  to reduce thrombotic risk. E. Phlebotomy is used only after hydroxyurea and  interferon have been tried.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 13) Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal disorder  that involves a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor  cell. Clinically, it is characterized by a proliferation of  red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes, and platelets. The  precise etiology is unknown. Unlike chronic myeloid  leukemia, no consistent cytogenetic abnormality has  been associated with the disorder. However, a muta- tion in the autoinhibitory, pseudokinase domain of the  tyrosine kinase JAK2â€”that replaces valine with phenyl- alanine (V617F), causing constitutive activation of the  kinaseâ€”appears to have a central role in the pathogen- esis of PV. Erythropoiesis is regulated by the hormone  erythropoietin. Hypoxia is the physiologic stimulus that  increases the number of cells that produce erythropoi- etin. Erythropoietin may be elevated in patients with  hormone-secreting tumors. Levels are usually â€œnormalâ€  in patients with hypoxic erythrocytosis. In PV, how- ever, because erythrocytosis occurs independently of  erythropoietin, levels of the hormone are usually low.  Therefore, an elevated level is not consistent with the  diagnosis. PV is a chronic, indolent disease with a low  rate of transformation to acute leukemia, especially in  the absence of treatment with radiation or hydroxy- urea. Thrombotic complications are the main risk for  PV and correlate with the erythrocytosis. Thrombocy- tosis, although sometimes prominent, does not correlate  with the risk of thrombotic complications. Salicylates are  useful in treating erythromelalgia but are not indicated  in asymptomatic patients. There is no evidence that  thrombotic risk is significantly lowered with their use in  patients whose hematocrits are appropriately controlled  with phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treat- ment. Induction of a state of iron deficiency is critical to  prevent a reexpansion of the RBC mass. Chemothera- peutics and other agents are useful in cases of symptom- atic splenomegaly. Their use is limited by side effects,  and there is a risk of leukemogenesis with hydroxyurea.","

Answer: C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic risk.

Explanation:
Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an overproduction of all three cell lines in the bone marrow: erythrocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. However, the hallmark feature of PV is an inappropriately elevated hematocrit level (>45% in men and >47% in women) in the absence of erythropoietin (EPO) stimulation.

Statement A is incorrect because an elevated plasma EPO level is not an exclusion criterion for PV. In fact, PV patients often have normal or even low EPO levels due to the overproduction of erythrocytes.

Statement B is incorrect because the transformation to acute leukemia is less common in PV compared to other myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as chronic myeloid leukemia.

Statement D is partially correct. Aspirin should be considered for PV","C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic  risk.

Explanation:
Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by increased progenitor cell sensitivity to growth-promoting cytokines and associated with activating somatic mutations in the JAK2 TK. The diagnosis of PV is based on the presence of certain laboratory and clinical findings, including an elevated hematocrit, an inappropriately normal or low erythropoietin level, and an abnormal bone marrow morphology. An elevated erythropoietin level does not exclude the diagnosis of PV. Transformation to acute leukemia is uncommon but is associated with use of radiophosphorus or alkylating agents. Thrombocytosis, or an elevated platelet count, is a major risk factor for thrombosis in patients with PV. Aspirin is recommended for thrombosis prevention in high-risk patients with PV, but it is not prescribed to all patients. Phlebotomy is used as the initial treatment to",0,0

Chronic primary myelofibrosis B. Chronic myeloid leukemia C. Rheumatoid arthritis D. Systemic lupus erythematosus E. Tuberculosis","The answer is A.  (Chap. 13) Chronic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is the  least common myeloproliferative disorder and is considered   Review and Self-Assessment 761 a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of myelofi- brosis have been ruled out. The typical patient with PMF  presents in the sixth decade of life, and the disorder is  asymptomatic in many patients. Fevers, fatigue, night  sweats, and weight loss may occur in PMF, but these  symptoms are rare in other myeloproliferative disorders.  However, no signs or symptoms are specific for the diag- nosis of PMF. Often marked splenomegaly is present and  may extend across the midline and to the pelvic brim. A  peripheral blood smear demonstrates the typical findings  of myelofibrosis, including teardrop-shaped red blood  cells (RBCs), nucleated RBCs, myelocytes, and metamy- elocytes that are indicative of extramedullary hematopoi- esis. Anemia is usually mild, and platelet and leukocyte  counts are often normal. About 50% of patients with  PMF have the JAK2 V617F mutation. Bone marrow  aspirate is frequently unsuccessful because the extent  of marrow fibrosis makes aspiration impossible. When  a bone marrow biopsy is performed, it demonstrates  hypercellular marrow with trilineage hyperplasia and  increased number of megakaryocytes with large dysplas- tic nuclei. Interestingly, individuals with PMF often have  associated autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor,  antinuclear antibodies, or positive Coombs test results.  To diagnose someone as having PMF, it must be shown  that he or she does not have another myeloproliferative  disorder or hematologic malignancy that is the cause of  myelofibrosis. The most common disorders that present  in a similar fashion to PMF are polycythemia vera and  chronic myeloid leukemia. Other nonmalignant disor- ders that can cause myelofibrosis include HIV infection,  hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, systemic  lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, and bone marrow  replacement in other cancers such as prostate and breast  cancer. In the patient described here, there is no other  identifiable cause of myelofibrosis; thus, chronic PMF  can be diagnosed.","

Answer: D. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, early satiety, and splenomegaly, along with the laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis with left shift, and thrombocytosis, suggest a myeloproliferative neoplasm or a systemic inflammatory condition. The presence of teardrop cells, nucleated red blood cells, and immature granulocytes on the peripheral blood smear are indicative of an underlying bone marrow disorder.

The negative bone marrow aspiration and the absence of evidence of leukemia or lymphoma make chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) less likely. Chronic primary myelofibrosis (MPF) can present with splenomegaly and leukocytosis, but the absence of typical MPF features such as leukoerythroblastosis and reticulin fibrosis on bone marrow biopsy makes it less likely.

The positive rheumatoid factor","
A. Chronic primary myelofibrosis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and early satiety, along with the physical examination findings of marked splenomegaly, suggest a chronic bone marrow disorder. The peripheral blood smear findings of teardrop cells, nucleated red blood cells, and immature granulocytes are consistent with myelofibrosis. The bone marrow biopsy being unsuccessful in obtaining cells for analysis further supports this diagnosis. Chronic primary myelofibrosis is characterized by splenomegaly, anemia, and leukocytosis, and is often associated with splenic infarction and portal hypertension. The presence of rheumatoid factor is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, as it is a non-specific finding. Tuberculosis typically presents with fever, weight loss, and night sweats, and would not typically present with splenomegaly as the primary symptom.

Iron-deficiency anemia B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Chronic myeloid leukemia D. Myelodysplasia E. Pernicious anemia","The answer is E. (Chap. 13) Thrombocytosis may be â€œprimaryâ€ or â€œsec- ondary.â€ Essential thrombocytosis is a myeloproliferative  disorder that involves a multipotent hematopoietic pro- genitor cell. Unfortunately, no clonal marker can  reliably  distinguish it from more common nonclonal, reactive  forms of thrombocytosis. Only 50% of patients with  essential (primary) thrombocytosis have the JAK2 V617F  mutation. Therefore, the diagnosis is one of exclusion.  Common causes of secondary thrombocytosis include  infection, inflammatory conditions, malignancy, iron  deficiency, hemorrhage, and postsurgical states. Other  myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myeloid  leukemia and myelofibrosis, may result in thrombocy- tosis. Similarly, myelodysplastic syndromes, particularly  the 5q-syndrome, may cause thrombocytosis. Perni- cious anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency does not  typically cause thrombocytosis. However, correc- tion of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency may  cause a â€œreboundâ€ thrombocytosis. Similarly, cessa- tion of chronic ethanol use may also cause rebound   thrombocytosis.","

Answer: A. Iron-deficiency anemia

Explanation:

Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the total amount of iron in the body, leading to a decrease in the production of hemoglobin and, consequently, a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs). However, iron deficiency does not directly affect platelet production. Thrombocytosis, or an elevated platelet count, is a common finding in various conditions, including essential thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplasia. In essential thrombocytosis, there is an increase in the production of megakaryocytes, the cells that produce platelets, leading to an increase in the number of circulating platelets. Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the production of an abnormal population of white blood cells called blast cells, as well as an increase in platelets. Myelodysplasia is a group of bone marrow disorders characterized by ineffective production of all three types of blood cells","
A. Iron-deficiency anemia
Explanation:
The provided information indicates that the patient's platelet count is significantly elevated, which is not a characteristic feature of iron-deficiency anemia.

33,"A 38-year-old woman is referred for evaluation  of an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit that  was discovered during an evaluation of recurrent  headaches. Until about 8 months previously, she  was in good health, but she developed increasingly     persistent headaches with intermittent vertigo and   tinnitus. She was originally prescribed sumatriptan  for presumed migraine headaches but did not expe- rience relief of her symptoms. A CT scan of the  brain showed no evidence of mass lesion.  During  evaluation of her headaches, she was found to have a  hemoglobin of 17.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 52%.  Her only other symptom is diffuse itching after hot  showers. She is a nonsmoker. She has no history  pulmonary or cardiac disease. On physical examina- tion, she appears well. Her body mass index is 22.3  kg/m2. Vital signs are blood pressure of 148/84 mm  Hg, heart rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of  12 breaths/min, and SaO2 of 99% on room air. She  is afebrile. The physical examination, including full  neurologic examination, is normal. There are no  heart murmurs. There is no splenomegaly. Periph- eral pulses are normal. Laboratory studies confirm  elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. She also has  a platelet count of 650,000/Î¼L. Leukocyte count  is 12,600/Î¼L with a normal differential. Which of  the following tests should be performed next in the  evaluation of this patient? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Erythropoietin level C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation D. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase E. Red blood cell mass and plasma volume determination","The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) In a patient presenting with an elevated  hemoglobin and hematocrit, the initial step in the evalu- ation is to determine whether erythrocytosis represents a  true elevation in red blood cell (RBC) mass or whether  spurious erythrocytosis is present because of plasma vol- ume contraction. (See Figure 35.) This step may be not  necessary, however, in individuals with hemoglobin >20  g/dL. After absolute erythrocytosis has been determined  by measurement of RBC mass and plasma volume, the  cause of erythrocytosis must be determined. If there is  not an obvious cause of the erythrocytosis, an erythro- poietin level should be checked. An elevated erythropoi- etin level suggests hypoxia or autonomous production of  erythropoietin as the cause of erythrocytosis. However,  a normal erythropoietin level does not exclude hypoxia  as a cause. A low erythropoietin level should be seen in  the myeloproliferative disorder polycythemia vera (PV),  the most likely cause of erythrocytosis in this patient. PV  is often discovered incidentally when elevated hemo- globin is found during testing for other reasons. When  symptoms are present, the most common complaints are  related to hyperviscosity of the blood and include ver- tigo, headache, tinnitus, and transient ischemic attacks.  Patients may also complain of pruritus after showering.  Erythromelalgia is the term give to the symptom complex  of burning, pain, and erythema in the extremities and is  associated with thrombocytosis in PV. Isolated systolic  hypertension and splenomegaly may be found. In addi- tion to elevated red RBC mass and low erythropoietin  levels, other laboratory findings in PV include throm- bocytosis and leukocytosis with abnormal leukocytes  present. Uric acid levels and leukocyte alkaline phos- phatase may be elevated but are not diagnostic for PV.  Approximately 30% of individuals with PV are homo- zygous for the JAK2 V617F mutation, and >90% are  heterozygous for this mutation. This mutation located  on the short arm of chromosome 9 causes constitutive  activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) protein, a tyrosine  kinase that renders erythrocytes resistant to apoptosis  and allows them to continue production independently  from erythropoietin. However, not every patient with  PV expresses this mutation, and approximately 50% of  patients with chronic myelofibrosis and essential throm- bocytosis express this mutation. Thus, it is not recom- mended as an initial diagnostic test for PV but may be  used for confirmatory purposes. Bone marrow biopsy  provides no specific information in PV and is not rec- ommended.  Review and Self-Assessment 762","

Answer: C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of headaches, tinnitus, vertigo, and itching after hot showers, along with the elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggest the possibility of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), specifically polycythemia vera (PV). PV is a clonal hematologic disorder characterized by overproduction of all three cell lines in the bone marrow: erythrocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. The JAK2 V617F mutation is a somatic mutation that occurs in approximately 95% of patients with PV and is considered the diagnostic gold standard for this condition. Therefore, genetic testing for the JAK2 V617F mutation is the next appropriate test in the evaluation of this patient.

Bone marrow biopsy is not the next appropriate test as the diagnosis of PV can be made based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings without the need for a bone marrow biopsy in most cases","
B. Erythropoietin level

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of persistent headaches, tinnitus, and vertigo, along with an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggest the possibility of a primary polycythemia or secondary polycythemia due to erythropoietin-producing tumors. An elevated erythropoietin level would support the diagnosis of secondary polycythemia. Therefore, the next appropriate test to perform would be an erythropoietin level measurement.",0,0

Trisomy 12  Review and Self-Assessment 732","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) This patient presents with typical findings of  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which has an inci- dence of 1.5 per 100,000 people yearly. The typical age  of onset is in the mid forties, and there is a slight male  predominance. Half of individuals are asymptomatic at  the time of diagnosis. If symptoms are present, they are  typically nonspecific and include fatigue and weight loss.  Occasionally, patients have symptoms related to splenic  enlargement such as early satiety and left upper quad- rant pain. Laboratory findings are suggestive of CML.  A high leukocyte count of 100,000/Î¼L is typical, with  a predominant granulocytic differential, including neu- trophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and band forms.  The circulating blast count should be <5%. Anemia and  thrombocytosis are also common. The bone marrow  demonstrates nonspecific increase in cellularity with an  increase in the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio. The diagnosis  of CML is established by identifying a clonal expansion  of a hematopoietic stem cell possessing a reciprocal trans- location between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translo- cation results in the head-to-tail fusion of the breakpoint  cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11 with  the ABL1 (named after the Abelson murine leukemia  virus) gene located on chromosome 9q34. The bcr-abl  fusion protein results in constitutive activation of abl  tyrosine kinase enzyme that prevents apoptosis and leads  to increased survival of the cells containing the muta- tion.

Answer: C. Reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadelphia chromosome)

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of splenomegaly, leukocytosis with left shift, and anemia with a high hematocrit suggest the presence of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, specifically chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The most common cytogenetic abnormality in CML is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1), which is a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This genetic alteration leads to the constitutive activation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, resulting in uncontrolled myeloid cell proliferation. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadelphia chromosome).","
Based on the given clinical scenario, the patient's peripheral blood smear shows the presence of circulating blasts, which is not consistent with CEL as defined by the absence of the Ph chromosome or rearrangements of PDGFRA/PDGFRB or FGFR1. Therefore, CEL can be ruled out. The patient's bone marrow biopsy demonstrates increased cellularity with an increased myeloid to erythroid ratio, suggesting myeloid hyperplasia. Myeloid hyperplasia can be seen in various conditions, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF). Among these MPNs, CML is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph chromosome) or the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. Therefore, CML can be ruled out based on the absence of circulating blasts and the normal cytogenetic analysis.

The specific chromosomal abnormalities predict  in which stage of differentiation the cell is arrested and  are associated with the several subtypes of AML that  have been identified. In the United States, >16,000  new cases of AML are diagnosed yearly, and the num- bers of new cases of AML has increased in the past   10 years. Men are diagnosed with AML more frequently  than women (4.6 cases per 100,000 population vs 3.0  cases per 100,000, respectively). In addition, older age  is associated with increased incidence of AML, with an  incidence of 18.6 cases per 100,000 population in those  older than 65 years of age. AML is uncommon in adoles- cents. Other known risk factors for the development of  AML include hereditary genetic abnormalities, radiation  and chemical exposures, and drugs. The most common  hereditary abnormality linked to AML is trisomy 21  (Down syndrome). Other hereditary syndromes associ- ated with an increase of AML include diseases associated  with defective DNA repair such as Fanconiâ€™s anemia  and ataxia telangiectasia. Survivors of the atomic bomb  explosions in Japan were found to have a high incidence  of AML as have survivors of other high-dose radiation  exposures. However, therapeutic radiation is not associ- ated with an increased risk of AML unless the patient  was also treated concomitantly with alkylating agents.  Anticancer drugs are the most common causes of drug- associated AML. Of the chemotherapeutic agents, alkyl- ating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors are the drugs  most likely to be associated with AML.","

Answer: B.

Explanation:

A. Anticancer drugs such as alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors are indeed major risk factors for drug-associated acute myeloid leukemias (AML). These agents damage the DNA of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, leading to genetic mutations and the development of leukemia.

C. Men do have a slightly higher incidence of AML compared to women, with a ratio of approximately 1.2:1.

D. The incidence of AML is highest in older adults, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals over the age of 60.

E. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is indeed associated with an increased risk of AML, with a 10- to 20-fold increased risk compared to the general population.

B. However, individuals treated with therapeutic radiation alone, without the use of alkylating agents, do not have an increased risk of developing AML. Radiation alone can cause damage to the DNA of hematopoietic stem and progen","
B. Individuals exposed to high-dose radiation are at risk for acute myeloid leukemia, but individuals treated with therapeutic radiation are not unless they are also treated with alkylating agents.

Explanation:
The context information indicates that previous exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, particularly topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents, is a risk factor for therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), which accounts for ~10% to 20% of all AML cases. However, it also states that individuals exposed to high-dose radiation are at risk for acute myeloid leukemia, but this statement is not limited to therapy-related cases. Therefore, the statement B is not entirely accurate as it does not specify that the radiation exposure must be in the context of therapy and the use of alkylating agents.

Therefore, the correct answer is: B. Individuals exposed to high-dose radiation are at risk for acute myeloid leukemia, but individuals treated with therapeutic radiation are not unless they are also treated with alkylating agents.",0,0
36,"A 56-year-old woman is diagnosed with chronic  myeloid leukemia, Philadelphia chromosome posi- tive. Her presenting leukocyte count was 127,000/ Î¼L, and her differential shows <2% circulating  blasts. Her hematocrit is 21.1% at diagnosis. She  is asymptomatic except for fatigue. She has no  siblings. What is the best initial therapy for this   patient? A. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant B. Autologous stem cell transplant C. Imatinib mesylate D. Interferon-Î± E. Leukapheresis","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) The goal of therapy in chronic myeloid leu- kemia (CML) is to achieve prolonged, durable, non- neoplastic, nonclonal hematopoiesis, which entails the  eradication of any residual cells containing the BCR- ABL1 transcript. Hence, the goal is complete molecular  remission and cure. Therapy of CML has changed in  recent years because of the presence of a proven curative   Review and Self-Assessment 763 treatment (allogeneic transplantation) that has significant  toxicity and a targeted treatment (imatinib) with out- standing outcome based on 8-year follow-up data. New  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are becoming available, mak- ing this a dynamic topic. Many experts currently recom- mend initiating therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and reserving allogeneic transplantation for those who  develop drug resistance. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine  kinase inhibitor that acts to decrease the activity of the  bcr-abl fusion protein that results from the recipro- cal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadel- phia chromosome). It acts as a competitive inhibitor of  the abl kinase at its ATP binding site and thus leads to  inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in  bcr-abl signal transduction. In newly diagnosed CML,  imatinib results in a complete hematologic remission in  95% of patients initially and 76% at 18 months. Low- risk patients have a higher durable remission rate. All  imatinib-treated patients who achieved major molecular  remission (26%), defined as 3 log or greater reduction  in BCR-ABL1 transcript level at 18 months compared  with pretreatment level, were progression free at 5 years.  There is a consensus that molecular responses can be  used as a treatment goal in CML. Imatinib, taken orally,  has limited side effects that include nausea, fluid reten- tion, diarrhea, and skin rash and is usually well tolerated.  Interferon-Î± was previously the first-line chemotherapy  if bone marrow transplant was not an option, but it has  been replaced by imatinib mesylate. Autologous stem cell  transplant is not currently used for treatment of CML  because there is no reliable way to select residual normal  hematopoietic progenitor cells. Leukopheresis is used for  control of leukocyte counts when the patient is experi- encing complications such as respiratory failure or cere- bral ischemia related to the high white blood cell count.","

Answer: A. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant

Explanation:
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) or the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The patient's diagnosis of CML, Philadelphia chromosome positive, and the absence of significant peripheral blasts (<2%) indicate that she is in the chronic phase of the disease.

The best initial therapy for this patient depends on several factors, including the patient's age, overall health, and availability of a suitable donor for an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT).

1. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (A): This is the curative treatment for CML in the chronic phase. It involves replacing the patient's diseased bone marrow with healthy donor marrow. The donor can be a sibling, an unrelated donor, or a haploidentical donor. The success rate of this treatment is highest when performed in the early chronic phase of the disease.

2. Autologous stem cell transplant","
C. Imatinib mesylate (STI571) therapy is the best initial therapy for a 56-year-old woman diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Philadelphia chromosome positive, with an asymptomatic presentation, a leukocyte count of 127,000/Î¼L, and a hematocrit of 21.1%. Imatinib mesylate, also known as STI571, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, which is the hallmark of CML. This therapy has been shown to significantly improve outcomes in patients with CML, including increasing overall survival and reducing the risk of disease progression. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant and autologous stem cell transplant are typically considered for patients with advanced disease or those who are not responding to initial therapy. Interferon-Î± is an older treatment option that has largely been replaced by targeted therapies like imatinib mesylate. Leukapheresis is a procedure used to remove white blood cells from the blood and is not typically used as initial therapy for CML",0,1
37,"A 76-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with  complaints of fatigue for 4 months and fever for the  past week. His temperature has been as high as 38.3Â°C  at home. During this time, he intermittently has had  a 5.5-kg weight loss, severe bruising with minimal  trauma, and an aching sensation in his bones. He last  saw his primary care physician 2 months ago and was  diagnosed with anemia of unclear etiology at that  time. He has a history of a previous left middle cere- bral artery cerebrovascular accident, which has left  him with decreased functional status. At baseline, he  is able to ambulate in his home with the use of a  walker and is dependent on a caregiver for assistance  with his activities of daily living. His vital signs are  blood pressure of 158/86 mm Hg, heart rate of 98  beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, SaO2  95%, and temperature of 38Â°C. He appears cachec- tic with temporal muscle wasting. He has petechiae  on his hard palate. He has no lymph node enlarge- ment. On cardiovascular examination, there is a  II/VI systolic ejection murmur present. His lungs  are clear. The liver is enlarged and palpable 6 cm  below the right costal margin. In addition, the spleen  is enlarged, with a palpable spleen tip felt about   4 cm below the left costal margin. There are multi- ple hematomas and petechiae present in the extremi- ties. Laboratory examination reveals the following:  hemoglobin, 5.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 15%; platelets,  12,000/Î¼L; and white blood cell (WBC) count,  168,000/Î¼L with 45% blast forms, 30% neutrophils,  20% lymphocytes, and 5% monocytes. Review of  the peripheral blood smear confirms acute myeloid  leukemia (M1 subtype, myeloblastic leukemia with- out maturation) with complex chromosomal abnor- malities on cytogenetics. All of the following confer  a poor prognosis for this patient EXCEPT: A. Advanced age B. Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics  Review and Self-Assessment 733 C. Hemoglobin below 7 g/dL D. Prolonged interval between symptom onset and  diagnosis E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) Patients with acute leukemia frequently pres- ent with nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and weight  loss. In addition, weight loss and anorexia are also com- mon. About half have had symptoms for >3 months at  the time of presentation. Fever is present in only about  10% of patients at presentation, and 5% have evidence of  abnormal hemostasis. On physical examination, hepato- megaly, splenomegaly, sternal tenderness, and evidence  of infection or hemorrhage are common presenting signs.  Laboratory studies are confirmatory with evidence of  anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis often pres- ent. The median presenting leukocyte count at presenta- tion is 15,000/Î¼L. About 20â€“40% have presenting leu- kocyte counts <5000/Î¼L, and another 20% have counts  >100,000/Î¼L. Review of the peripheral smear confirms  leukemia in most cases. If Auer rods are seen, the diagno- sis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is virtually certain.  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/Î¼L) is seen  in >75% of individuals with AML. After the diagnosis  of AML has been confirmed, rapid evaluation and treat- ment should be undertaken. The general health of the  cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems  should be evaluated because chemotherapy has adverse  effects that may cause organ dysfunction in any of these  systems. Overall, chromosome findings at diagnosis are  currently the most important independent prognostic   factor. Patients with t(15;17) have a very good prognosis    Review and Self-Assessment 764 (~85% cured), and those with t(8;21) and inv(16) have a  good prognosis (~55% cured), but those with no cytoge- netic abnormality have a moderately favorable outcome  (~40% cured). Patients with a complex karyotype, t(6;9),  inv(3), or â€“7, have a very poor prognosis. Among the  prognostic factors that predict poor outcomes in AML,  age at diagnosis is one of the most important because indi- viduals of advanced age tolerate induction chemotherapy  poorly. In addition, advanced age is more likely to be  associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities that  predict poorer response to chemotherapy, although some  chromosomal markers predict a better response to che- motherapy. Poor performance status independent of age  also decreases survival in AML. Responsiveness to chemo- therapy and survival are also worse if the leukocyte count  is >100,000/Î¼L or the antecedent course of symptoms  is prolonged. Anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytope- nia present for >3 months is a poor prognostic indicator.  However, there is no absolute degree of anemia or throm- bocytopenia that predicts worse outcomes.","

Answer: E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), specifically the M1 subtype, which is characterized by the absence of maturation of myeloblasts in the bone marrow. The presence of complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics is a poor prognostic factor in AML, as it indicates a higher risk of relapse and resistance to chemotherapy. Advanced age is also a poor prognostic factor in AML, as older patients have a higher risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. A hemoglobin level below 7 g/dL is also a poor prognostic factor, as anemia can limit the patient's ability to tolerate chemotherapy and increase the risk of infection. However, a WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L is actually a favorable prognostic factor in AML, as it indicates a high burden of leukemia cells, which may respond better to chemotherapy","
E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L

Explanation:
The given patient is diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a poor prognosis due to the presence of complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics. Advanced age, hemoglobin below 7 g/dL, and prolonged interval between symptom onset and diagnosis are all known factors that confer a poor prognosis for patients with AML. However, a high WBC count (above 100,000/Î¼L) is actually a favorable prognostic factor for AML, as it indicates a more mature form of the disease and a better response to chemotherapy. Therefore, the answer is E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L.

38,The evaluation in a newly diagnosed case of acute  lymphoid leukemia should routinely include all of  the following EXCEPT: A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Cell-surface phenotyping C. Cytogenetic testing D. Lumbar puncture E. Plasma viscosity,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 15) Viscosity testing is typically reserved for cases  of multiple myeloma in which paraproteins (particularly  immunoglobulin M) can lead to vascular sludging and  subsequent tissue ischemia. Acute lymphoid leukemia  (ALL) can lead to end-organ abnormalities in the kidney  and liver; therefore, routine chemistry tests are indicated.  A lumbar puncture must be performed in cases of newly  diagnosed ALL to rule out spread of disease to the central  nervous system. Bone marrow biopsy reveals the degree  of marrow infiltration and is often necessary for classifica- tion of the tumor. Immunologic cell-surface marker test- ing often identifies the cell lineage involved and the type  of tumor, information that is often impossible to discern  from morphologic interpretation alone. Cytogenetic test- ing provides prognostic information on the disease natu- ral history. In ALL, the prognosis depends on the genetic  characteristics of the tumor, the patientâ€™s age, the white  blood cell count, and the patientâ€™s overall clinical status and  major organ function.","

Answer: E. Plasma viscosity

Explanation:

In the evaluation of a newly diagnosed case of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), several diagnostic tests are essential to confirm the diagnosis and determine the subtype and prognostic features. These tests include:

1. Bone marrow biopsy: A bone marrow biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of bone marrow from the hip bone for examination under a microscope. It is used to assess the percentage of leukemia cells, the presence of blasts, and the involvement of the bone marrow.
2. Cell-surface phenotyping: This test, also known as immunophenotyping, is used to identify the specific type of ALL based on the expression of certain proteins on the surface of the leukemia cells. This information is crucial for determining the subtype and prognosis of ALL.
3. Cytogenetic testing: Cytogenetic testing is used to identify chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemia cells. This information is important for determining the prognosis and guiding treatment decisions.","
E. Plasma viscosity
Explanation:
The evaluation of a newly diagnosed case of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) should include a bone marrow biopsy, cell-surface phenotyping, and cytogenetic testing.

A lumbar puncture may also be necessary to evaluate for central nervous system involvement. Plasma viscosity is not a routine test in the evaluation of ALL.",1,1
39,All of the following infectious agents have been  associated with development of a lymphoid malig- nancy EXCEPT: A. Helicobacter pylori B. Hepatitis B C. Hepatitis C D. HIV E. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8),"The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Hepatitis B and C are both common causes  of cirrhosis and are strongly associated with the devel- opment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C, but  not hepatitis B, can also lead to a lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma, often in the spleen, that resolves with cure  of hepatitis C. Epstein-Barr virus has been associated  with a large number of lymphoid malignancies, includ- ing posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD),  Hodgkinâ€™s disease, central nervous system lymphoma,  and Burkittâ€™s lymphoma. Helicobacter pylori infection is  necessary and sufficient for gastric mucosa-associated  lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma development, and  cure can be achieved with eradication of the organism in  some cases. HHV8 is a known cause of body cavity lym- phoma, including primary pleural lymphoma. In addi- tion to those listed, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1  is associated with adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia.  Other disorders associated with lymphoma include  celiac sprue, autoimmune disease, and biologic therapies  for autoimmune disease. Celiac sprue has been associated  with gastrointestinal tract lymphoma. Many collagen  vascular diseases (e.g., Sjogrenâ€™s disease) and antiâ€“tumor  necrosis factor therapies have been associated with the  development of lymphoma.","

Answer: A. Helicobacter pylori

Explanation: Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that causes chronic gastritis and is associated with peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. It is not linked to the development of lymphoid malignancies, such as lymphoma or leukemia. The other mentioned agents, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, and Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), are all viruses that have been linked to various types of lymphoid malignancies.

His initial evaluation  should include all of the following EXCEPT: A. AST, ALT, and prothrombin time B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Coombs test D. Peripheral blood smear E. Physical examination","The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and throm- bocytopenia are common, and a peripheral blood smear  and a Coombs test help evaluate their presence. Hyper- splenism is also seen in chronic lymphoid leukemia  (CLL) as the spleen sequesters large numbers of circulat- ing blood cells and enlarges. Hence, a careful left upper  quadrant examination looking for a palpable splenic tip  is the standard of care in this situation. This patient is at  risk of hepatic decompensation as well, given his hepati- tis C that can also cause anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Bone marrow infiltration of tumor cells can lead to cyto- penias in CLL. However, this is in effect a diagnosis of  exclusion. After these three possibilities have been ruled  out, a bone marrow biopsy is a reasonable next step.  This initial evaluation before presuming spread of CLL is  critical for therapy because each possibility requires dif- ferent therapy (glucocorticoids or rituximab for hemoly- sis, hepatology referral for liver failure, and splenectomy  for symptomatic hypersplenism).","

Answer: C. Coombs test

Explanation:

The patient's decreased hematocrit and platelet count suggest anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. The causes of these conditions in this patient are likely related to his chronic lymphoid leukemia and hepatitis C infection.

The Coombs test is used to detect the presence of antibodies against red blood cell antigens, indicating the presence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, the patient's history of chronic lymphoid leukemia makes it more likely that his anemia is caused by bone marrow failure or ineffective erythropoiesis rather than autoimmune hemolysis. Therefore, a Coombs test would not be indicated in this case.

Instead, the initial evaluation should focus on identifying the cause of the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia. This may include a bone marrow biopsy to assess for bone marrow failure or infiltration by leukemia cells, as well as a peripheral blood smear to evaluate for","

Answer: C. Follicular lymphoma

Explanation:
Follicular lymphoma is a type of indolent (slow-growing) non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Indolent lymphomas generally have a better prognosis compared to aggressive lymphomas. With appropriate treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both, the majority of patients with follicular lymphoma can achieve long-term remission or even a cure. The prognosis for follicular lymphoma is generally better than that of Burkitt's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, which are aggressive lymphomas with a more rapid progression and poorer prognosis. Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease is a type of Hodgkin lymphoma, which has a different clinical course and prognosis compared to non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Overall, the prognosis for nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease is generally","
The prognosis for Burkitt's lymphoma is generally considered to be good with appropriate treatment, as it is a highly curable disease. However, it is important to note that the prognosis can vary depending on the specific subtype and individual patient factors.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) also has a variable prognosis, with some subtypes and patient factors carrying a poorer prognosis. The overall prognosis for DLBCL has improved with the introduction of more effective treatments, such as chemoimmunotherapy.

Follicular lymphoma is typically considered an indolent lymphoma, meaning that it tends to grow slowly and may not require immediate treatment. The prognosis for follicular lymphoma is generally good, with many patients living for many years with the disease.

Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma with a poorer prognosis compared to other types of lymphoma. Appropriate treatment, such as chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, can improve outcomes but may not cure the disease in all cases.

Answer: E. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

Explanation:

The given patient's symptoms and the lymph node biopsy findings are most consistent with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The enlarging, nontender lymph nodes without associated symptoms such as fever, chills, or weight loss are common in NHL. The biopsy image (Figure 47) shows a diffuse proliferation of lymphoid cells, which is a characteristic feature of NHL.

Burkitt's lymphoma typically presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, often in the abdomen, and is associated with fever, chills, and weight loss. Cat scratch disease is characterized by regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and systemic symptoms. CMV infection can cause lymphadenopathy, but it is usually associated with other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and malaise. Hodgkin's disease typically presents with painless, firm, and discrete lymph nodes, often in a specific sequence.

There","
Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is C. Cat scratch disease. The patient's symptoms of enlarging, nontender lymph nodes without other associated symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss, are consistent with cat scratch disease. The biopsy image (Figure 47) also supports this diagnosis, as it shows a granulomatous lymphadenopathy, which is a common finding in cat scratch disease. Additionally, the patient's occupation, sexual activity, and lack of other risk factors for malignancy or HIV make these diagnoses less likely.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of enlarging, nontender lymph nodes without other associated symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss, are not typical of Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Burkitt's lymphoma is also less likely due to the absence of fever and the patient's age.

44,All of the following statements regarding mastocy- tosis are true EXCEPT: A. Elevated serum tryptase suggests aggressive   disease. B. Eosinophilia is common. C. It is often associated with myeloid neoplasm. D. More than 90% of cases are confined to the skin. E. Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common clinical  manifestation.,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 16) Mastocytosis is a proliferation and accumula- tion of mast cells in one or more organ systems. Only  the skin is involved in approximately 80% of cases with  the other 20% being defined as systemic mastocytosis  caused by the involvement of another organ system. The  most common manifestation of mastocytosis is cutaneous  urticaria pigmentosa, a maculopapular pigmented rash  involving the papillary dermis. Other cutaneous forms  include diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (almost entirely  in children) and mastocytoma. Clinical manifestations of  systemic mastocytosis are related to either cellular infil- tration of organs or release of histamine, proteases, eico- sanoids, or heparin from mast cells. Therefore, signs and  symptoms may include constitutional symptoms, skin  manifestations (pruritus, dermatographia, rash), medi- ator-related symptoms (abdominal pain, flushing, syn- cope, hypertension, diarrhea), and bone-related symp- toms (fracture, pain, arthralgia). In a recent series, 40%  of patients with systemic mastocytosis had an associated  myeloid neoplasm, most commonly myeloproliferative  syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplas- tic syndrome. Eosinophilia was present in approximately  one-third of patients. Elevated serum tryptase, bone mar- row involvement, splenomegaly, skeletal involvement,  cytopenia, and malabsorption predict more aggressive  disease and a worse prognosis. Many patients with sys- temic mastocytosis have an activating mutation of c-Kit,  a kinase inhibited by imatinib; however, the mutation  appears relatively resistant to this agent.","

Answer: C. It is often associated with myeloid neoplasm.

Explanation:
Mastocytosis is a group of disorders characterized by the clonal expansion of mast cells in one or more organs. The disease can present with cutaneous, systemic, or organ-limited symptoms. Contrary to statement C, mastocytosis is not typically associated with myeloid neoplasms, such as leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Instead, it is considered a distinct entity in the spectrum of hematologic disorders.","D. More than 90% of cases are confined to the skin.
Explanation: According to the provided context, mastocytosis is a disorder characterized by mast cell proliferation and accumulation, leading to various clinical manifestations. The disease can be systemic or confined to the skin, and the clinical features depend on the extent of disease. Approximately 80% of patients with mastocytosis have evidence of cutaneous involvement, but other organs such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and gastric mucosa can also be involved. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that more than 90% of cases are confined to the skin.",0,1

(Chap. 17) The patient presents with pneumococcal  pneumonia and evidence of hypercalcemia, renal fail- ure, and a wide protein gap suggestive of an M pro- tein. These findings are classic for multiple myeloma.  Although the patient appears to be making large quan- tities of immunoglobulins, they are in fact generally  monoclonal, and patients actually have functional hypo- gammaglobulinemia related to both decreased produc- tion and increased destruction of normal antibodies. This  hypogammaglobulinemia predisposes patients to infec- tions, most commonly pneumonia with pneumococcus  or Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative pyelonephritis.  Bone marrow biopsy would confirm the presence of  clonal plasma cells and define the quantity, which will  help define treatment options. A serum protein electro- phoresis would also be indicated to prove the presence  of the M protein suspected by the wide protein gap.  Although HIV may be associated with kidney injury,  both acute and chronic, hypercalcemia would be an  unusual feature. There is no clinical history of aspira- tion, and the location of infiltrate, upper lobe, is unusual  for aspiration. Sweat chloride testing is not indicated  because there is no suspicion for cystic fibrosis.

Answer: C. HIV antibody

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia. The causative organism, Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a common bacterial pathogen that can cause pneumonia. However, certain underlying conditions can increase the risk of developing pneumococcal pneumonia. One such condition is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Therefore, testing for HIV antibodies is the most appropriate test to confirm the underlying condition predisposing the patient to pneumococcal pneumonia. The other options listed are not relevant to the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia.

46,"A 64-year-old African American man is evaluated in  the hospital for congestive heart failure, renal failure,  and polyneuropathy. Physical examination on admis- sion was notable for these findings and raised waxy  papules in the axilla and inguinal region. Admission  laboratories showed a blood urea nitrogen of 90 mg/ dL and a creatinine of 6.3 mg/dL. Total protein  was 9.0 g/dL with an albumin of 3.2 g/dL. Hema- tocrit was 24%, and white blood cell and platelet  counts were normal. Urinalysis was remarkable for  3+ proteinuria but no cellular casts. Further evalu- ation included an echocardiogram with a thickened  left ventricle and preserved systolic function. Which  of the following tests is most likely to diagnose the  underlying condition? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Electromyogram (EMG) with nerve conduction  studies C. Fat pad biopsy D. Right heart catheterization E. Renal ultrasonography","The answer is A.  (Chap. 18) This patient presents with a multisystem ill- ness involving the heart, kidneys, and peripheral ner- vous system. The physical examination is suggestive of  amyloidosis with classic waxy papules in the folds of his  body. The laboratory test results are remarkable for renal  failure of unclear etiology with significant proteinuria  but no cellular casts. A possible etiology of the renal   failure is suggested by the elevated gamma globulin frac- tion and low hematocrit, bringing to mind a monoclo- nal gammopathy perhaps leading to renal failure through  amyloid AL deposition. This could also account for the   Review and Self-Assessment 766 enlarged heart seen on the echocardiography and the  peripheral neuropathy. The fat pad biopsy is generally  reported to be 60â€“80% sensitive for amyloid; how- ever, it would not allow a diagnosis of this patientâ€™s  likely myeloma. A right heart catheterization probably  would prove that the patient has restrictive cardiomy- opathy secondary to amyloid deposition; however, it too  would not diagnose the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.  Renal ultrasonography, although warranted to rule out  obstructive uropathy, would not be diagnostic. Simi- larly, the electromyographic and nerve conduction stud- ies would not be diagnostic. The bone marrow biopsy is  about 50â€“60% sensitive for amyloid, but it would allow  evaluation of the percent of plasma cells in the bone  marrow and allow the diagnosis of multiple myeloma to  be made. Multiple myeloma is associated with amyloid  AL in approximately 20% of cases. Light chains most  commonly deposit systemically in the heart, kidneys,  liver, and nervous system, causing organ dysfunction. In  these organs, biopsy would show the classic eosinophilic  material that, when exposed to Congo red stain, has a  characteristic apple-green birefringence.","

Answer: C. Fat pad biopsy

Explanation:

The patient's presentation of congestive heart failure, renal failure, polyneuropathy, and waxy papules in the axilla and inguinal region is consistent with a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal disease. The waxy papules are a sign of subperiosteal new bone formation, which is a common finding in this condition.

The most likely test to diagnose this condition is a fat pad biopsy. In secondary hyperparathyroidism, there is increased osteoclastic activity leading to the release of calcium and phosphorus from bone, which can be detected in the fat pad. The fat pad biopsy will show increased osteoclast activity and increased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the fat tissue.

Bone marrow biopsy is not the most likely test as it is used to evaluate bone marrow cells and their function, not the bone itself.

C. Fat pad biopsy

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including congestive heart failure, renal failure, polyneuropathy, and waxy papules, are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The most likely type of amyloidosis in this case is AL amyloidosis, which is characterized by the deposition of light chains in various organs. The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is typically confirmed by identifying the presence of amyloid deposits in a tissue biopsy. Fat pad biopsy is the most commonly used tissue biopsy site for the diagnosis of amyloidosis due to the high yield of amyloid deposition in subcutaneous fat. Therefore, a fat pad biopsy is the most likely test to diagnose the underlying condition in this patient.",0,0
47,"A 75-year-old man is hospitalized for treatment of  a deep-vein thrombosis. He had recently been dis- charged from the hospital about 2 months ago. At  that time, he had been treated for community- acquired pneumonia complicated by acute respira- tory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He  was hospitalized for 21 days at that time and had dis- charged from a rehabilitation 2 weeks ago. On the  day before admission, he developed painful swelling  of his left lower extremity. Lower extremity Doppler  ultrasonography confirmed an occlusive thrombus  of his deep femoral vein. After an initial bolus, he  is started on a continuous infusion of unfractionated  heparin at 1600 U/hr because he has end-stage renal  disease on hemodialysis. His activated partial throm- boplastin time is maintained in the therapeutic range.  On day 5, it is noted that his platelets have fallen from  150,000/Î¼L to 88,000/Î¼L. What is the most appro- priate action at this time? A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and  assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. B. Stop all anticoagulation while awaiting results of  anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. C. Stop heparin infusion and initiate argatroban. D. Stop heparin infusion and initiate enoxaparin. E. Stop heparin infusion and initiate lepirudin.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 19) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is  a clinical diagnosis that must not be missed because life- threatening thrombosis can occur if not treated appro- priately. The cause of HIT is the formation of antibodies  to the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4).  This complex is able to activate platelets, monocytes,  and endothelial cells. Many patients exposed to heparin  will develop antibodies to the heparinâ€“PF4 complex, but  only a few of these will progress to develop thrombocy- topenia or thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT).  The typical patient will develop evidence of HIT 5 to  14 days after exposure to heparin, although it can occur  within 5 days in individuals exposed to heparin within  about the previous 100 days as would be expected in this  patient given his recent hospitalization. The nadir platelet  count is typically >20,000/Î¼L. When HIT is suspected,  one should not delay treatment for laboratory testing  because no currently available test has adequate sensitiv- ity or specificity for the diagnosis. The antiheparin/PF4  antibody test result is positive in many individuals who  have been exposed to heparin regardless of whether HIT  is present. The platelet activation assay is more specific  but less sensitive for HIT. As soon as HIT is suspected,  heparin should be discontinued and replaced with an  alternative form of anticoagulation to protect against  development of new thromboses. Low-molecular-weight  heparins (LMWHs) such as enoxaparin are not appropri- ate treatment options in individuals with HIT. Although   heparin is 10 times more likely to cause HIT, LMWHs  also cause the illness and should not be used. The primary  agents used for HIT in the United States are the direct  thrombin inhibitors argatroban and lepirudin. Argatroban  is the preferred agent for this patient because of his renal  failure. The drug is not excreted by the kidneys, and  no dosage adjustment is required. In contrast, lepirudin  is markedly increased in renal failure, and a significant  dosage adjustment is required. Danaparoid has previ- ously been used frequently for HIT and HITT, but this  medication is no longer available in the United States.  Other anticoagulants that are used for treatment of HITT  include bivalirudin and fondaparinux, but these also are  not currently approved for use in the United States.","

Answer: A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies.

Explanation:

The patient's platelet count drop from 150,000/Î¼L to 88,000/Î¼L after starting heparin therapy raises the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, it is important to note that other causes of thrombocytopenia, such as sepsis, drug reactions, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), should also be considered.

The most appropriate initial action in this situation is to continue the heparin infusion and assess for HIT. This is because the diagnosis of HIT is based on both clinical suspicion and laboratory testing. The gold standard for diagnosing HIT is the presence of both a positive HIT antibody test and a decrease in platelet count of 50% or more from the baseline or a platelet count less than 100,000/Î¼L.

Therefore","
A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies.

Explanation:
The patient's platelet count has dropped from 150,000/Î¼L to 88,000/Î¼L, which is a sign of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the patient is still in the acute phase of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treatment, and stopping anticoagulation at this point could lead to thrombus extension or recurrence. Therefore, the most appropriate action at this time is to continue the heparin infusion and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. If HIT is confirmed, alternative anticoagulation options such as argatroban, lepirudin, or danaparoid can be considered.",0,0
48,"A 48-year-old woman is evaluated by her primary  care physician for a complaint of gingival bleed- ing and easy bruising. She has noted the problem  for about 2 months. Initially, she attributed it to  aspirin that she was taking intermittently for head- aches, but she stopped all aspirin and nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drug use 6 weeks ago. Her only  medical history is an automobile accident 12 years  previously that caused a liver laceration. It required  surgical repair, and she did receive several transfu- sions of red blood cells and platelets at that time.  She currently takes no prescribed medications and  otherwise feels well. On physical examination, she  appears well and healthy. She has no jaundice or  scleral icterus. Her cardiac and pulmonary exami- nation results are normal.

What tests are indicated  for the workup of this patientâ€™s thrombocytopenia? A. Antiplatelet antibodies B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Hepatitis C antibody D. Human immunodeficiency antibody E. C and D F. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 19) This patient presents with symptoms of  thrombocytopenia, including bleeding gums and easy  bruising. The only finding on physical examination  may be petechiae at points of increased venous pressure,  especially in the feet and ankles. The laboratory findings  confirm thrombocytopenia but show no abnormalities in  other cell lines. When evaluating isolated thrombocyto- penia, one must initially consider whether an underlying  infection or medication is causing the platelet count to  fall. There is a long list of medications that are implicated  in thrombocytopenia, including aspirin, acetaminophen,  penicillins, H2 blockers, heparin, and many others. This  patient discontinued all medications over 6 weeks pre- viously, and the platelet count would be expected to  recover if a medication reaction were the cause. She  gives no signs of any acute infection. Thus, the most  likely diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenia purpura  (ITP). This disorder is also known as idiopathic throm- bocytopenia purpura and refers to an immune-mediated  destruction of platelets and possible inhibition of plate- let release from megakaryocytes. ITP can truly be idio- pathic, or it can be secondary to an underlying disorder,  including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV, or  chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The platelet  count can be quite low (<5000/Î¼L) in patients with ITP  and usually presents with mucocutaneous bleeding. Lab- oratory testing for ITP should include a peripheral smear  that typically demonstrates large platelets with other- wise normal morphology. Initial testing should evaluate  for secondary causes of ITP, including HIV antibodies,  HCV antibodies, serologic testing for SLE, serum pro- tein electrophoresis, and immunoglobulins. If anemia is  also present, a direct Coombs test is indicated to assess  whether there is a combined autoimmune hemolytic  anemia with ITP (Evans syndrome). Antiplatelet anti- body testing is not recommended because these tests  have low sensitivity and specificity for ITP. In addition,  bone marrow biopsy is typically not performed unless  there are other abnormalities that are not explained by  ITP or the patient has failed to respond to usual therapy.","

Answer: F. All of the above

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of easy bruising and petechiae, along with her history of liver injury and blood transfusions, raise the possibility of thrombocytopenia due to an underlying disorder. The differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia is broad and includes various causes such as drug-induced, viral, immune-mediated, and bone marrow disorders.

Given the patient's history of liver injury and blood transfusions, it is important to consider the possibility of post-transfusion viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C. Therefore, testing for hepatitis C antibody (D) is indicated.

Additionally, the patient's history of easy bruising and petechiae, along with her normal white blood cell count and differential, suggests an immune-mediated cause of thrombocytopenia. Therefore, testing for antiplatelet antibodies (A) is also indicated.

Furthermore, the patient's thrombocytopenia and liver injury raise the possibility of a bone mar","
Based on the provided information, the most likely cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia is not clear. Therefore, a range of tests should be considered to rule out various possible causes. The patient's history of liver injury and transfusions raises the possibility of an underlying liver disease or an immune-mediated cause of thrombocytopenia. Therefore, tests for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) should be considered. Additionally, given the patient's symptoms of easy bruising and petechiae, an evaluation for an underlying coagulopathy or platelet function disorder should be considered. Antiplatelet antibodies and a bone marrow biopsy could be indicated if the workup suggests an immune-mediated cause or if the platelet count remains low despite a thorough evaluation.

49,Which of the following statements regarding  hemophilia A and B is TRUE? A. Individuals with factor VIII deficiency have a more  severe  clinical course than those with factor IX deficiency. B. Levels of factor VIII or IX need to be measured  before administration of replacement therapy in pa- tients presenting with acute bleeding to calculate the  appropriate dose of factor. C. Primary prophylaxis against bleeding is never indicated. D. The goal level of factor VIII or IX is >50% in the set- ting of large-volume bleeding episodes. E. The life expectancy of individuals with hemophilia is  about 50 years.,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) The hemophilias are X-linked inherited dis- orders that cause deficiency of factor VIII (hemophilia A)  or factor 9 (hemophilia B). The hemophilias affect about  1 in 10,000 males worldwide with hemophilia A respon- sible for 80% of cases. Clinically, there is no difference  between hemophilia A and B. The disease presentation  largely depends on the residual activity of factor VIII or  factor IX. Severe disease is typically seen when factor  activity is <1%, and moderate disease appears when the   levels range between 1% and 5%. The clinical manifesta- tion of moderate and severe disease is commonly bleed- ing into the joints, soft tissues, and  muscles that occurs  after  minimal trauma or even spontaneously. When fac- tor activity is >25%, bleeding would occur only after  major trauma or surgery, and the diagnosis may not be  made unless a prolonged activated partial thromboplas- tin time is seen on routine laboratory examination. To  make a definitive diagnosis, one would need to mea- sure specific levels of factor VIII and IX. Without treat- ment, life expectancy is limited, but given the changes in  therapy since the 1980s, the life span is about 65 years.  Early treatment of hemophilia required the use of pooled  plasma that was used to make factor concentrates. Given  the large number of donors required to generate the fac- tor concentrates and the frequent need for transfusion  in some individuals, bloodborne pathogens such as HIV  and hepatitis C are among the leading cause of death in  patients with hemophilia. In the 1990s, recombinant fac- tor VIII and IX were developed. Primary prophylaxis is  given to individuals with baseline factor activity levels of  <1% to prevent spontaneous bleeding, especially hemar- throses. Although this strategy is highly recommended,  only about 50% of eligible patients receive prophylactic  therapy because of the high costs and need for regular  intravenous infusions. When an individual is suspected  of having a bleed, the treatment should begin as soon  as possible and not delayed until factor activity levels  return. Factor concentrates should be given to raise the  activity level to 50% for large hematomas or deep muscle  bleeds, and an individual may require treatment for a  period of 7 days or more. For milder bleeds, including  uncomplicated hemarthrosis, the goal factor activity level  is 30â€“50% with maintenance of levels between 15% and  25% for 2 to 3 days after the initial transfusions. In addi- tion to treatment with factor concentrates, care should  be taken to avoid medications that inhibit platelet func- tion. DDAVP, a desmopressin analogue, can be given as  adjunctive therapy for acute bleeding episodes in hemo- philia A because this may cause a transient rise in factor  VIII levels and von Willebrand factor because of release  from endothelial cells. This medication is typically only  useful in mild to moderate disease. Antifibrinolytic drugs  such as tranexamic acid or Îµ-amino caproic acid are help- ful in promoting hemostasis for mucosal bleeding.","

Answer: A. Individuals with factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) have a more severe clinical course than those with factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B).

Explanation:
Hemophilia A and B are inherited disorders characterized by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII and IX, respectively. The severity of the disease varies depending on the residual activity level of the deficient clotting factor. Individuals with severe hemophilia have less than 1% of the normal activity level, moderate hemophilia has 1-5% activity, and mild hemophilia has 6-50% activity.

Individuals with hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) generally have a more severe clinical course compared to those with hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). This is because factor VIII plays a crucial role in the early stages of the coagulation cascade, and its deficiency can lead to more extensive and prolonged bleeding episodes. In contrast, factor IX deficiency affects the later stages of the coagulation cascade, and its deficiency may result in less severe bleeding symptoms.

Therefore, statement A is true.","A. Individuals with factor VIII deficiency have a more severe clinical course than those with factor IX deficiency.

Explanation:
From the context, we learn that hemophilia A is caused by factor VIII deficiency and hemophilia B is caused by factor IX deficiency. The text also states that hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B and that the clinical course of hemophilia A is more severe than that of hemophilia B. Therefore, statement A is true.

Statement B is true as well, as the text explains that the appropriate dose of factor replacement therapy depends on the patient's weight and the severity of their condition, which is determined by the level of factor deficiency.

Statement C is false, as primary prophylaxis against bleeding is indicated for individuals with severe hemophilia to prevent joint damage and the development of joint disease.

Statement D is false, as the goal level of factor VIII or IX for large-volume bleeding episodes is typically higher than 50%. The target levels for surgery, central nervous system bleeding, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary bleeds are 100%, while the target level for bleeding into joint",0,0

Platelets","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  is a consumptive coagulopathy that is characterized by  diffuse intravascular fibrin formation that overcomes the  bodyâ€™s natural anticoagulant mechanisms. DIC is most  commonly associated with sepsis, trauma, or malignancy  or in obstetric complications. The pathogenesis of DIC  is not completely elucidated, but it involves intravascular  exposure to phospholipids from damaged tissue, hemo- lysis, and endothelial damage. This leads to stimulation of  procoagulant pathways with uncontrolled thrombin gen- eration and microvascular ischemia. A secondary hyper- fibrinolysis subsequently occurs. The primary  clinical   Review and Self-Assessment 768 manifestations of DIC are bleeding at venipuncture sites,  petechiae, and ecchymoses. Severe gastrointestinal and  pulmonary hemorrhage can occur. The clinical diagnosis  of DIC is based on laboratory findings in the appropri- ate clinical setting, such as severe sepsis. Although there  is no single test for DIC, the common constellation of  findings is thrombocytopenia (<100,000/Î¼L), elevated  prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplas- tin time, evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mia, and elevated fibrin degradation productions and  d-dimer. The fibrinogen level may be <100 mg/dL but  often does not decrease acutely unless the DIC is very  severe. The primary treatment of DIC is to treat the  underlying cause, which in this case would be antibiotic  therapy directed against Neisseria meningitidis. For patients  such as this one who are experiencing bleeding related to  the DIC, attempts to correct the coagulopathy should be  undertaken. Platelet transfusions and fresh-frozen plasma  (FFP) should be given. In addition, cryoprecipitate is  indicated as the fibrinogen level is <100 mg/dL. In gen- eral, 10 U of cryoprecipitate are required for every 2 to  3 units of FFP. In acute DIC, heparin is not been dem- onstrated to be helpful and may increase bleeding.

Answer: E. Platelets

Explanation:

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with meningococcal sepsis, which is characterized by bacteremia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The laboratory findings, such as thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and decreased haptoglobin, support the diagnosis of DIC.

The patient's coagulation studies show an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and decreased fibrinogen levels, which are indicative of a consumptive coagulopathy.

The treatment for this patient should include supportive measures such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation. Antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, are indicated to treat the underlying infection. Cryoprecipitate and fresh-frozen plasma are indicated to replace consumed coagulation factors and fibrinogen, respectively. Heparin may be used to prevent further clotting","
E. Platelets
Explanation:
The patient is in circulatory collapse due to disseminated meningococcemia, which is a bacterial infection causing widespread intravascular coagulation. The laboratory studies show evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and aPTT, and low fibrinogen levels. The patient is also making less than 20 mL of urine each hour, which is indicative of renal failure, another complication of DIC. The patient's blood is noted to be oozing from all IV sites and his endotracheal secretions are blood tinged, indicating ongoing bleeding.

Given this information, the most appropriate treatments for this patient would be:

51,All the following are vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagu- lation factors EXCEPT: A. Factor X B. Factor VII C. Protein C D. Protein S E. Factor VIII,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays  an essential role in hemostasis. It is absorbed in the small  intestine and stored in the liver. It serves as a cofactor in  the enzymatic carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on  prothrombin-complex proteins. The three major causes  of vitamin K deficiency are poor dietary intake, intesti- nal malabsorption, and liver disease. The prothrombin  complex proteins (factors II, VII, IX, and X and protein  C and protein S) all decrease with vitamin K deficiency.  Factor VII and protein C have the shortest half-lives  of these factors and therefore decrease first. Therefore,  vitamin K deficiency manifests with prolongation of the  prothrombin time first. With severe deficiency, the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time will be prolonged as  well. Factor VIII is not influenced by vitamin K.","

Answer: C. Protein C

Explanation:
Protein C is not a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor. It is an anticoagulant protein, which means it inhibits the coagulation process. Protein C is synthesized in the liver and requires vitamin K for its post-translational carboxylation, but it is not considered a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor itself. The other factors listed (Factor X, Factor VII, Factor VIII, and Factor IX) are all vitamin K-dependent proteins that play crucial roles in the coagulation cascade.","
Explanation: All the given factors, Factor X, Factor VII, Protein C, Protein S, and Factor VIII, are vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors. Therefore, none of the options is the correct answer. However, if we assume that the query is asking for the exception among the given factors that are not vitamin K–dependent, then the answer would be E. Factor VIII is not a vitamin K–dependent coagulation factor. It is synthesized in the liver and also in endothelial cells.",0,0
52,A 31-year-old man with hemophilia A is admitted  with persistent gross hematuria. He denies recent  trauma and any history of genitourinary pathology.  The examination is unremarkable. Hematocrit is  28%. All the following are treatments for hemo- philia A EXCEPT: A. Desmopressin (DDAVP) B. Fresh-frozen plasma C. Cryoprecipitate D. Recombinant factor VIII E. Plasmapheresis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Hemophilia A results from a deficiency of  factor VIII. Replacement of factor VIII is the center- piece of treatment. Cessation of aspirin or nonsteroi- dal anti-inflammatory drugs is highly recommended.  Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains pooled plasma from  human sources. Cryoprecipitate refers to FFP that is  cooled, resulting in the precipitation of material at the  bottom of the plasma. This product contains about half  the factor VIII activity of FFP in a tenth of the volume.  Both agents are therefore reasonable treatment options.  DDAVP (desmopressin) causes the release of a number  of factors and von Willebrand factor from the liver and  endothelial cells. This may be useful for patients with  mild hemophilia. Recombinant or purified factor VIII  (i.e., Humate P) is indicated in patients with more severe  bleeding. Therapy may be required for weeks, with lev- els of factor VIII kept at 50%, for postsurgical or severe  bleeding. Plasmapheresis has no role in the treatment of  patients with hemophilia A.","

Answer: E. Plasmapheresis

Explanation:
Plasmapheresis is a procedure used to remove plasma from the blood and replace it with other fluids. It is not a treatment for hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of factor VIII, a clotting factor. The treatments for hemophilia A include:

1. Desmopressin (DDAVP): It is a synthetic analog of vasopressin, which stimulates the release of factor VIII from the endothelial cells. It is used to increase the level of factor VIII in the blood in mild to moderate hemorrhage.
2. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP): It is a pooled human blood product that contains all the clotting factors, including factor VIII. It is used to replace the missing clotting factors in severe hemorrhage.
3. Cryoprecipitate: It is a blood product that contains high levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. It is used to replace the missing clotting factors in severe hemorrhage.
4. Recombinant factor VIII:","
E. Plasmapheresis

Explanation:
Plasmapheresis is not a treatment for hemophilia A. It is used for the removal of plasma components, such as antibodies, in various clinical scenarios, including the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, it is not a treatment for hemophilia A. Instead, treatments for hemophilia A include desmopressin (DDAVP), fresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and recombinant factor VIII.",1,1
53,All of the following statements regarding the lupus  anticoagulant (LA) are true EXCEPT: A. LAs typically prolong the activated partial thrombo- plastin time. B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence  of LAs. C. Bleeding episodes in patients with LAs may be   severe and life threatening. D. Female patients may experience recurrent   midtrimester abortions. E. LAs may occur in the absence of other signs of   systemic lupus erythematosus.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 20) Lupus anticoagulants (Las) cause prolonga- tion of coagulation tests by binding to phospholipids.  Although most often encountered in patients with sys- temic lupus erythematosus, they may also develop in  normal individuals. The diagnosis is first suggested by  prolongation of coagulation tests. Failure to correct  with incubation with normal plasma confirms the pres- ence of a circulating inhibitor. Contrary to the name,  patients with LA activity have normal hemostasis and are  not predisposed to bleeding. Instead, they are at risk for  venous and arterial thromboembolisms. Patients with a  history of recurrent unplanned abortions or thrombosis  should undergo lifelong anticoagulation. The presence  of LAs or anticardiolipin antibodies without a history  of thrombosis may be observed because many of these  patients will not go on to develop a thrombotic event.","

Answer: B. A 1:1 mixing study will correct in the presence of LAs.

Explanation:

Lupus anticoagulants (LAs) are a type of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) that can cause hypercoagulability and thrombosis. They are characterized by their ability to prolong coagulation tests, such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the Russell viper venom time (rVVT).

A 1:1 mixing study is a laboratory test used to differentiate between a true coagulation disorder and a laboratory interference. In this test, the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma in equal volumes, and the clotting time is measured. If the clotting time is corrected (shortened) in the presence of normal plasma, it suggests that the prolongation of the coagulation test was due to a laboratory interference, such as a lupus anticoagulant.

However, in the case of LAs, the 1:1 mixing study will not correct the prolongation of the aPTT or rVVT","
B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence of LAs.
Explanation:
The statements A, C, D, and E are all true regarding the lupus anticoagulant (LA). However, statement B is false. In the presence of LAs, a 1:1 mixing study will correct the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) as the normal plasma will contain sufficient phospholipids to correct the effect of the LA on the clotting assay. The false-positive lupus anticoagulant test results are not uncommon, occurring frequently in patients who are on oral anticoagulants. False-negative results may occur if the blood sample was suboptimally centrifuged and the aPTT was not properly measured. The confirmatory assays for LA, such as the platelet neutralization procedure (PNP) and the hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization test (Staclot LA), demonstrate that upon addition of excess phospholipid, the clotting time becomes corrected.",0,0
54,All the following cause prolongation of the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time that does not  correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma  EXCEPT: A. Lupus anticoagulant B. Factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Factor VII inhibitor E. Factor IX inhibitor,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) involves the factors of the intrinsic pathway of  coagulation. Prolongation of the aPTT reflects either a  deficiency of one of these factors (factor VIII, IX, XI,  XII, and so on) or inhibition of the activity of one of the  factors or components of the aPTT assay (i.e., phospho- lipids). This may be further characterized by the â€œmix- ing studyâ€ in which the patientâ€™s plasma is mixed with  pooled plasma. Correction of the aPTT reflects a defi- ciency of factors that are replaced by the pooled sample.  Failure to correct the aPTT reflects the presence of a fac- tor inhibitor or phospholipid inhibitor. Common causes  of a failure to correct include the presence of heparin in  the sample, factor inhibitors (factor VIII inhibitor being  the most common), and the presence of antiphospho- lipid antibodies. Factor VII is involved in the extrinsic  pathway of coagulation. Inhibitors to factor VII would  result in prolongation of the prothrombin time.","

Answer: C. Heparin

Explanation:

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a laboratory test used to assess the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways. Prolongation of aPTT indicates a defect in these pathways.

A. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) is an antibody that interferes with the coagulation process by binding to phospholipids and/or coagulation proteins, leading to prolongation of aPTT.

B. Factor VIII inhibitor is an antibody that inhibits the activity of Factor VIII, which is a cofactor in the coagulation cascade. This results in a prolonged aPTT.

C. Heparin is an anticoagulant that acts by binding to antithrombin III, enhancing its ability to inactivate thrombin and factor Xa. Heparin does not directly affect aPTT but rather prolongs the prothrombin time (PT).

D. Factor VII inhibitor is an antibody that inhibits the activity of Factor VII, which is","
C. Factor VII inhibitor
Explanation: According to the context information, a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that does not correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma indicates the presence of an inhibitor. Factor VII inhibitor is not an exception to this rule, as it can also cause a prolonged aPTT that does not correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma. However, the context information also mentions that factor VII inhibitor may cause a normal prothrombin time (PT) but a prolonged aPTT. Therefore, the correct answer is A, lupus anticoagulant, which is the only inhibitor that does not cause a prolonged PT.",0,0
55,"You are evaluating a 45-year-old man with an acute  upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the emergency  department.

Which of the following is most likely  to yield a diagnosis for the cause of his GI bleeding? A. Factor VIII activity level B. Helicobacter pylori antibody test C. Hepatitis B surface antigen D. Hepatitis C RNA E. Mesenteric angiogram","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) This patient presents with a significant upper  gastrointestinal (GI) bleed with a prolonged prothrom- bin time (PT). Hemophilia should not cause a prolonged  PT. This and the presence of ascites raise the possibility  of liver disease and cirrhosis. The contamination of blood  products in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in widespread  transmission of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) within  the hemophilia population receiving factor infusions.    Review and Self-Assessment 769 It is estimated in 2006, that >80% of hemophilia patients  older than 20 years old are infected with HCV. Viral  inactivation steps were introduced in the 1980s, and  recombinant factor VIII and IX were first produced in  the 1990s. HCV is the major cause of morbidity and  the second leading cause of death in patients exposed  to older factor concentrates. Patients develop cirrhosis  and complications that include ascites and variceal bleed- ing. End-stage liver disease requiring a liver transplant is  curative for the cirrhosis and the hemophilia (the liver  produces factor VIII). Hepatitis B was not transmitted in  significant numbers to patients with hemophilia. Diver- ticular disease or peptic ulcer disease would not explain  the prolonged PT. Patients with inadequately repleted  factor VIII levels are more likely to develop hemarthro- ses than GI bleeds, and the slightly prolonged activated  partial thromboplastin time makes this unlikely.","

Answer: E. Mesenteric angiogram

Explanation:

The patient's history of hemarthroses and the recent administration of factor VIII prior to presentation raises the suspicion of a coagulopathy related to his hemo- philia A. However, his prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and international normalized ratio (INR) suggest that there is an additional coagulopathy present. The most likely cause of the acute GI bleed in this patient is mesenteric ischemia due to thrombosis, which can occur in patients with hemo- philia A and is associated with the use of factor VIII concentrate. A mesenteric angiogram is the most appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia. Factor VIII activity level would not be helpful in diagnosing the cause of the GI bleed, as it would only confirm the presence or absence of factor VIII deficiency. Helicobacter pylori antibody test, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C RNA are not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of liver disease or G","
E. Mesenteric angiogram

Explanation:
The patient's history of hemarthroses and the recent factor VIII injection raise the suspicion of a coagulopathy. However, the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio suggest a consumptive coagulopathy, which could be due to various causes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver disease, or mesenteric ischemia. The normal platelet count and absence of lower extremity edema argue against DIC. The normal renal function and urinalysis results suggest that liver disease is less likely. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's GI bleeding is mesenteric ischemia, which can be diagnosed by mesenteric angiography.",0,0

Serial laboratory analysis  Review and Self-Assessment 737","The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) The differentiation between disseminated  intravascular coagulation (DIC) and severe liver disease  is challenging. Both entities may manifest with similar  laboratory findings, which are elevated fibrinogen deg- radation products, prolonged activated partial thrombo- plastin time and prothrombin time, anemia, and throm- bocytopenia. When suspecting DIC, these tests should  be repeated over a period of 6 to 8 hours because abnor- malities may change dramatically in patients with severe  DIC. In contrast, these test results should not fluctuate  as much in patients with severe liver disease. Bacterial  sepsis with positive blood cultures is a common cause of  DIC but is not diagnostic.","

Answer: E. Serial laboratory analysis

Explanation:

The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease is through serial laboratory analysis. In DIC, there is an activation of the coagulation cascade leading to consumption of coagulation factors, platelets, and fibrinolysis. This results in a consumptive coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT, and elevated fibrin degradation products (d-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products). However, in chronic liver disease, there is a functional impairment of the liver's ability to produce coagulation factors, resulting in a hypocoagulable state with a prolonged aPTT and low fibrinogen levels.

In this case, the patient's thrombocytopenia, elevated d-dimer, and prolonged aPTT suggest DIC. However, it is important to note that these findings can also be present in chronic liver disease. Therefore, serial laboratory analysis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of DIC. A single laboratory result may not be sufficient to","
E. Serial laboratory analysis

Explanation:
The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease is through serial laboratory analysis. In chronic liver disease, the fibrinogen levels are typically low due to decreased synthesis, whereas in DIC, fibrinogen levels are low due to consumption. Additionally, in DIC, D-dimer levels are elevated due to fibrin degradation, whereas in chronic liver disease, D-dimer levels may be normal or only mildly elevated. Repeating the laboratory tests over time can help differentiate between the two conditions. Other tests, such as blood cultures, may be helpful in ruling out other causes of thrombocytopenia or bleeding, but they do not directly distinguish between DIC and chronic liver disease.",1,1
57,All of the following genetic mutations are associ- ated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis  EXCEPT: A. Factor V Leiden mutation B. Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor C. Heterozygous protein C deficiency D. Prothrombin 20210G E. Tissue plasminogen activator,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 21) Venous thrombosis occurs through activation  of the coagulation cascade primarily through the expo- sure to tissue factor, and the genetic factors that contrib- ute to a predisposition to venous thrombosis typically  are polymorphisms affecting procoagulant or fibrinolytic  pathways. In contrast, arterial thrombosis occurs in the  setting a platelet activation, and the genetic predisposi- tion for arterial thrombosis includes mutations that affect  platelet receptors or redox enzymes. The most common  inherited risk factors for venous thrombosis are the factor  V Leiden mutation and prothrombin 20210 mutation.  Other mutations predisposing an individual to venous  thrombosis include inherited deficiency of protein C or  S and mutations of fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activa- tor, thrombomodulin, or plasminogen activator inhibitor.  The glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor mutation would  increase the risk of arterial, but not venous, thrombosis.","

Explanation:

The given genetic mutations are all linked to an increased risk of thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. However, the mutation D, Prothrombin 20210G, is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis due to an increased production of thrombin, a clotting factor. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that this mutation is the exception when it comes to increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis.

The other mutations listed, Factor V Leiden mutation, Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor, and Heterozygous protein C deficiency, are all associated with an increased risk of thrombosis due to various mechanisms. Factor V Leiden mutation leads to a reduced ability of activated protein C to inactivate Factor Va and Factor VIIIa, resulting in a hypercoagulable state. Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor mutations can lead to a hyperreactive platelet response to injury or activation, leading to excessive clotting. Heterozygous protein C","
C. Heterozygous protein C deficiency

Explanation:
The context information indicates that heterozygous protein C deficiency is associated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis. Therefore, option C is incorrect. The other options, Factor V Leiden mutation, Prothrombin 20210G, and Tissue plasminogen activator, are all associated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis as per the context information.",0,0

Physical examination is revealing for  2+ edema in his left ankle. A d-dimer is ordered  and is elevated. Which of the following makes  d-dimer less predictive of DVT in this patient? A. Age older than 70 years B. History of active tobacco use C. Lack of suggestive clinical symptoms D. Negative Homanâ€™s sign on examination E. Previous DVT in the past year","The answer is A.  (Chap. 21) d-Dimer is a degradation product of cross- linked fibrin and is elevated in conditions of ongoing  thrombosis. Low concentrations of d-dimer are considered  to indicate the absence of thrombosis. Patients older than  the age of 70 years frequently have elevated d-dimers  in the absence of thrombosis, making this test less pre- dictive of acute disease. Clinical symptoms are often not  present in patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)  and do not affect interpretation of a d-dimer. Tobacco  use, although frequently considered a risk factor for  DVT, and previous DVT should not affect the predic- tive value of d-dimer. Homanâ€™s sign, calf pain elicited by  dorsiflexion of the foot, is not predictive of DVT and is  unrelated to d-dimer.","

Answer: D. Negative Homan's sign on examination

Explanation:

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that is released during the process of thrombosis. It is a sensitive but not specific marker for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In other words, a positive d-dimer test result indicates a high likelihood of DVT, but a negative d-dimer test result does not rule out DVT.

The patient's age, history of tobacco use, and previous DVT increase the likelihood of DVT in this case. However, the absence of a positive Homan's sign (pain or tenderness in the calf upon dorsiflexion of the foot) is a finding that decreases the likelihood of DVT. Homan's sign is a common clinical finding in DVT, but it is not present in all cases. Therefore, a negative Homan's sign does not make d-dimer less predictive of DVT in all cases, but it does make it less predictive in this specific case.","
E. Previous DVT in the past year

Explanation:
The d-dimer test is a sensitive but nonspecific marker for thrombosis. In the context of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a positive d-dimer test result increases the likelihood of DVT, but a negative result does not exclude it. The predictive value of d-dimer is influenced by various factors, including age, clinical presentation, and other medical conditions. In this case, the patient is a 76-year-old man with a history of DVT within the past year. Previous DVT increases the likelihood of a false-positive d-dimer result due to ongoing thrombosis or residual d-dimer from the previous episode. Therefore, the presence of previous DVT makes d-dimer less predictive of a new DVT in this patient.",0,0

Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast  multislice computed tomography scan of the chest. E. Obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography  scan of the chest.","The answer is E.  (Chaps. 21 and 22) The clinical probability of pulmonary  embolism (pulmonary embolism) can be delineated into  low to high likelihood using the clinical decision rule  shown in Table 22-1. In those with a score of 3 or less,  pulmonary embolism is low or moderately likely, and a  d-dimer test should be performed. A normal d-dimer  result combined with a low to moderate clinical prob- ability of pulmonary embolism identifies patients who  do not need further testing or anticoagulation therapy.  Those with either a likely clinical probability (score >3)  or an abnormal d-dimer (with unlikely clinical probabil- ity) require an imaging test to rule out pulmonary embo- lism. Currently, the most attractive imaging method to  detect pulmonary embolism is the multislice computed  tomography (CT). It is accurate and, if the result is nor- mal, safely rules out pulmonary embolism. This patient  has a clinical probability score of 4.5 because of her rest- ing tachycardia and the lack of an alternative diagnosis at  least as likely as pulmonary embolism. Therefore, there is  no indication for measuring d-dimer, and she should pro- ceed directly to multislice CT of the chest. If this cannot  be performed expeditiously, she should receive one dose  of low-molecular-weight heparin while awaiting the test.","

Answer: C. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, treat for deep-vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset shortness of breath, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation, along with her recent history of increased smoking frequency, make deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) high on the differential diagnosis list. DVT and PE are common thromboembolic conditions that can present with these symptoms. The first step in evaluating this patient should be to assess her risk for DVT/PE using clinical assessment tools such as the Wells score or the revised Geneva score. If the clinical assessment suggests a high probability of DVT/PE, further diagnostic testing should be pursued.

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that is released during the process of clot formation and lysis. Elevated levels of d-dimer in the blood can indicate the presence of a thromboembolic event. A negative d-dimer result does not completely rule out DVT/","D. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, recent travel, and smoking increase her risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Given her normal chest radiograph and complete blood count, d-dimer testing is a reasonable next step. If the d-dimer result is normal, she can be discharged with close follow-up. However, if the d-dimer result is abnormal, a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest is indicated to evaluate for PE or DVT.

60,All of the anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs listed  are correctly matched with their mechanisms of  action EXCEPT: A. Abciximabâ€”Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor   inhibitor B. Clopidogrelâ€”Adenosine diphosphate receptor  blockade C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition D. Rivaroxabanâ€”Factor Xa inhibition E. Warfarinâ€”Inhibition of production of the vitamin  Kâ€“dependent clotting factors,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 23) In recent years, a variety of new anticoagulant  and antiplatelet drugs have been developed for clinical use.   Platelets play an important role in arterial thrombosis,  particularly in coronary artery and cerebrovascular dis- ease. Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet drug  worldwide. Aspirin exerts its effects through inhibition of  cyclooxygenase-1. Other commonly used oral antiplatelet  agents are clopidogrel and dipyridamole. Clopidogrel is in  a class of agents called thienopyridines along with ticlopi- dine. Thienopyridines act to block a specific adenosine  diphosphate receptor (P2Y12) and inhibit platelet aggrega- tion. Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase to decrease  the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP) to decrease platelet aggregation. Intravenous  antiplatelet agents have also become increasingly impor- tant in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. All of  the intravenous agents act to inhibit platelet aggregation  by blocking the glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa receptor. The   Review and Self-Assessment 770 three agents in clinical use as Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors are  abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban.  Anticoagulant agents are primarily used for the preven- tion and treatment of venous thrombosis. Many antico- agulants are available and act by a variety of mechanisms.  Heparin has been used for many years but requires frequent  monitoring to be used safely. More recently, low-molec- ular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been introduced.  These agents are given subcutaneously and generally pre- ferred in many instances over heparin given a more predict- able anticoagulant effect. Both heparin and the LMWHs  are indirect thrombin inhibitors that act primarily through  activation of antithrombin. When activated, antithrombin  inhibits clotting enzymes, especially thrombin and factor  Xa. Fondaparinux is a newer anticoagulant that inhibits  only factor Xa, although it is a synthetic analogue of the  pentasaccharide sequence in heparin that binds antithrom- bin. However, it is too short to bridge antithrombin to  thrombin. The direct thrombin inhibitors bind directly to  thrombin (rather than antithrombin) to exert their activ- ity. The direct thrombin inhibitors include lepirudin, arg- atroban, and bivalirudin. The most commonly used oral  anticoagulant is warfarin, which inhibits the production  of vitamin Kâ€“dependent clotting factors. Given the need  for frequent monitoring and extensive drug interactions,  developing other oral anticoagulants that are safe and effec- tive has been desired for many years. No oral drug has yet  been introduced into the market. However, several are in  the final stages of development. These include two factor  Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and one factor IIa  inhibitor (dabigatran etexilate).","

Answer: A. Abciximab—Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor

Explanation:
Abciximab is an antiplatelet medication that works by binding to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets, preventing them from forming clots by inhibiting the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. It is not a direct thrombin inhibitor or a factor Xa inhibitor. Enoxaparin and Rivaroxaban are low molecular weight heparin and a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor, respectively. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is metabolized to an active metabolite that irreversibly inhibits the ADP receptor on platelets, preventing them from aggregating. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that inhibits the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.","
B. Clopidogrel—Adenosine diphosphate receptor blockade

Explanation:
Clopidogrel is not a direct adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor blocker. Instead, it is an irreversible inhibitor of the platelet P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor. This means that it prevents the P2Y12 receptor from binding to ADP, which is necessary for platelet aggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel, R-clopidogrel, irreversibly binds to the P2Y12 receptor and inhibits its function. This results in reduced platelet aggregation and a decreased risk of thrombotic events.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, and the statement ""Clopidogrel—Adenosine diphosphate receptor blockade"" is incorrect.",0,0
61,"A 66-year-old woman is prescribed clopidogrel  and aspirin after implantation of a bare metal stent  in her right coronary artery.

She likely has aspirin resistance and should be treated  with higher doses of aspirin to prevent a recurrence. B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a  genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway. C. She should have been treated with low-molecular- weight heparin to prevent this complication. D. She should have been treated with warfarin to pre- vent this complication. E. Because she has demonstrated resistance to clopido- grel, switching to prasugrel would not be useful to  prevent further complications.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) After implantation of a bare metal coronary  artery stent, aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended  for at least 4 weeks to decrease the risk of in-stent reste- nosis. This patient, however, developed the complica- tion despite adherence to her therapy. This generally  suggests resistance to clopidogrel with a decreased ability  of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregation. There is  a known genetic component to clopidogrel resistance  related to specific genetic polymorphisms of the CYP  isoenzymes. Up to 25% of whites, 30% of African Amer- icans, and 50% of Asians may carry an allele that renders  them resistant to clopidogrel. These polymorphisms are  less important in the activation of prasugrel. Thus, in  individuals who have evidence of clopidogrel resistance,  switching to prasugrel should be considered.  Aspirin resistance is a more controversial subject. It  is defined simply in clinical terms as failure of aspirin to  prevent ischemic vascular events. Biochemically, aspirin  resistance can be defined by failure of usual doses of the  drug to produce inhibitory effects on platelet function.  However, resistance to aspirin is not reversed by higher  doses of aspirin or adding another antiplatelet agent.  Because the primary mechanism of arterial thrombosis  is platelet aggregation, the anticoagulant agents warfarin  and low-molecular-weight heparin are not indicated.","

Answer: B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation of acute-onset chest pain and electrocardiographic changes consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction, despite being on dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) after a stent implantation, suggests in-stent restenosis. The most likely cause of this complication in this scenario is clopidogrel resistance, which is caused by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene. This gene encodes an enzyme that metabolizes clopidogrel in the liver, and certain genetic variants can result in reduced clopidogrel metabolism and decreased platelet inhibition. Therefore, option B is the most correct answer.

Aspirin resistance is not a likely cause of the patient's restenosis, as aspirin is not a platelet inhibitor but rather an anti-inflammatory agent that acts by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase.","
B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway.

Explanation:
The context information indicates that the patient is taking clopidogrel and aspirin after a bare metal stent implantation in her right coronary artery. However, she experiences an acute inferior myocardial infarction due to in-stent restenosis despite her adherence to her prescribed therapy. Clopidogrel resistance, which is caused by genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 pathway, can lead to decreased clopidogrel metabolism and a decreased antiplatelet effect. This resistance may explain the patient's restenosis despite her current therapy. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.

Option A is incorrect because aspirin resistance is not a cause of restenosis in this context. Option C is incorrect because low-molecular-weight heparin is not typically used to prevent restenosis after stent implantation. Option D is incorrect because warfarin is an oral anticoagulant and not an antiplatelet agent",1,1
62,"A 48-year-old woman is diagnosed with a deep- vein thrombosis of her left lower extremity. When  considering initial anticoagulant therapy, all of the  following are advantages of low-molecular-weight  heparins over heparin EXCEPT: A. Better bioavailability B. Dose-dependent clearance C. Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection D. Lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia E. Predictable anticoagulant effect","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs)  have largely replaced heparin for most indications if a  patient does not have any contraindications to therapy.  LMWHs have better bioavailability and longer half-lives  after subcutaneous injection. Thus, they can be given at  routine intervals for both prophylaxis and treatment. In  addition, dosing of LMWHs is simplified because these  drugs have a dose-independent clearance, and predict- able anticoagulant effects means that monitoring of anti- coagulant effect is not required in most patients. Finally,  LMWHs have a lower risk of heparin-induced throm- bocytopenia, which is important in both short- and  long-term administration.","

Answer: C. Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection

Explanation:
Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) are both anticoagulants used for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). LMWHs have several advantages over UFH:

1. Better bioavailability: LMWHs have a smaller molecular size, which allows for better penetration into the systemic circulation and deeper into the clot, making them more effective than UFH.
2. Dose-dependent clearance: LMWHs have a more predictable anticoagulant effect due to their consistent molecular weight and dose-dependent clearance, making it easier to achieve and maintain therapeutic anticoagulation.
3. Lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): LMWHs have a lower risk of HIT compared to UFH due to their smaller molecular size and different binding properties to platelets.
4. Predictable","C. Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection
Explanation: Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have a shorter half-life compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH). This advantage allows for more predictable anticoagulant effect and the possibility of fixed or weight-adjusted dosing without routine laboratory monitoring. The shorter half-life also makes LMWHs more convenient for patients as they can be administered once or twice daily with subcutaneous dosing. The other advantages listed in the query are true for LMWHs.",0,0

A 56-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for  breast cancer D. A 62-year-old man who underwent hip replacement  surgery 4 weeks previously E. A 72-year-old man who had an acute myocardial  infarction 2 weeks ago,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) The d-dimer measured by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is elevated in the setting  of breakdown of fibrin by plasmin, and the presence of  a positive d-dimer can prompt the need for additional  imaging for deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary  embolus in specific clinical situations in which the patient  would be considered to have an elevation in d-dimer.  However, one must be cautious about placing value on  an elevated d-dimer in other situations when there can  be an alternative explanation for the elevated level. Of  the scenarios listed in the question, the only patient who  would be expected to have a negative d-dimer result  would be the patient with calf pain and recent air travel.  The presence of a normal alveolarâ€“arterial oxygen gradi- ent cannot reliably differentiate between those with and  without pulmonary embolism. In all the other scenarios,  elevations in d-dimer could be related to other medi- cal conditions and provide no diagnostic information  to inform the clinician regarding the need for further  evaluation. Some common clinical situations in which  the d-dimer is elevated include sepsis, myocardial infarc- tion, cancer, pneumonia, the postoperative state, and the  second and third trimesters of pregnancy.","

Answer: All of the above patients can have a positive d-dimer due to various reasons. However, a positive d-dimer result should prompt further evaluation for a pulmonary embolus (PE) in patients with clinical suspicion, especially in those with risk factors.

Explanation:

1. A 24-year-old woman who is 32 weeks pregnant: Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, and d-dimer levels are often elevated. However, the presence of dyspnea, especially acute dyspnea, in a pregnant woman should raise suspicion for PE, and further evaluation is necessary.
2. A 48-year-old man with no medical history who presents with calf pain following prolonged air travel: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE are common complications of prolonged immobility during air travel. D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product and is often elevated in patients with DVT or PE. A positive d-dimer result in this patient should prompt further evaluation for PE.
3. A 56-year-old woman undergoing chem","
A. A 24-year-old woman who is 32 weeks pregnant
Explanation: 
The context information indicates that the patient is a pregnant woman presenting with acute dyspnea. The study discussed in the text suggests that a positive D-dimer test in pregnant women with suspected PE would prompt additional testing, such as CTPA or VQ scan. Therefore, a positive D-dimer test in a pregnant woman with acute dyspnea would warrant further evaluation for PE.

The other patients in the query do not meet the criteria for further evaluation based on their individual circumstances. For example, the 24-year-old man with no medical history and calf pain following prolonged air travel has a normal alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, which is not consistent with PE. The other patients have medical conditions that increase their risk for PE, but they do not present with acute dyspnea.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. A 24-year-old woman who is 32 weeks pregnant.",0,0
64,A 62-year-old woman is hospitalized following  an acute pulmonary embolism. All of the follow- ing would typically indicate a massive pulmonary  embolism EXCEPT: A. Elevated serum troponin levels B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis C. Initial presentation with syncope D. Presence of right ventricular enlargement on CT  scan of the chest E. Presence of right ventricular hypokinesis on   echocardiogram,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) Clinically, individuals with massive pulmonary  embolus present with hypotension, syncope, or cyanosis.  The hypotension and syncope occur due to acute right ven- tricular overload, and elevated troponin or amino terminal   (NT)-pro-brain natriuretic peptide can result from this  right ventricular strain. Both elevated troponin and NT- pro-brain natriuretic peptide predict worse outcomes in  pulmonary embolism. Further prognostic signs of massive  pulmonary embolism include the presence of right ventric- ular enlargement on computed tomography of the chest  or right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiography.   The presence of hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, or   Review and Self-Assessment 771 cough in association with pulmonary embolism most  commonly indicates a small peripheral lesion.","

Answer: B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis

Explanation:

Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the sudden blockage of a major pulmonary artery or its branches by a thrombus or an embolus. The presentation of a massive PE can vary, but common symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and hemodynamic instability. Hemoptysis, or the coughing up of blood, is not a typical initial presentation for a massive PE. Hemoptysis is more commonly associated with conditions such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, or other pulmonary diseases.

Therefore, the answer to the question is B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis.

A. Elevated serum troponin levels: Elevated troponin levels can indicate myocardial injury, which is a common complication of massive PE due to the increased workload on the heart and the release of troponin from damaged cardiac muscle.

C. Initial presentation with syncope: Syncope, or fain","
C. Initial presentation with syncope

Explanation:
Massive pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition characterized by hemodynamic instability, which can lead to shock and death. The presence of elevated serum troponin levels, right ventricular enlargement on CT scan of the chest, and right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram are all indicative of a massive pulmonary embolism. However, syncope is not a typical presentation for massive pulmonary embolism. Syncope is more commonly associated with submassive pulmonary embolism or other causes.",1,0
65,"Which of the following statements regarding diag- nostic imaging in pulmonary embolism is TRUE? A. A high probability ventilationâ€“perfusion scan is one  that has at least one segmental perfusion defect in the  setting of normal ventilation. B. If a patient has a high probability ventilationâ€“  perfusion scan, there is a 90% likelihood that the  patient does indeed have a pulmonary embolism. C. Magnetic resonance angiography provides excel- lent resolution for both large proximal and smaller  segmental pulmonary emboli. D. Multidetector-row spiral CT imaging is suboptimal  for detecting small peripheral emboli, necessitating  the use of invasive pulmonary angiography. E. None of the routinely used imaging techniques  provide adequate evaluation of the right ventricle to  assist in risk stratification of the patient.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) For many years, ventilationâ€“perfusion imag- ing (V-Q) was the standard for the diagnosis of pulmo- nary embolism (pulmonary embolism). Determination of  abnormal V-Q imaging can be difficult. To call a V-Q  scan a high-probability scan, one needs to see two or more  segmental perfusion defects in the setting of normal venti- lation. In patients with underlying lung disease, however,  ventilation is frequently abnormal, and most patients with  pulmonary embolism do not actually have high-probabil- ity V-Q scans. When there is a high-probability V-Q scan,  the likelihood of pulmonary embolism is 90% or greater.  Alternatively, patients with normal perfusion imaging  have a very low likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Most  patients fall into either the low or intermediate probabil- ity of having a pulmonary embolism by V-Q imaging.  In this setting, 40% of patients with a high clinical suspi- cion of pulmonary embolism are determined by pulmo- nary angiography to indeed have a pulmonary embolism  despite having a low-probability V-Q scan. At the present  time, V-Q scanning is largely supplanted by multidetec- tor-row spiral computed tomography (CT) angiography  of the chest. Compared with conventional CT scanning  with intravenous contrast, the multidetector spiral CT can  provide evaluation of the pulmonary arteries to the sixth- order branches, a level of resolution that is as good as or  exceeds that of conventional invasive pulmonary angiog- raphy. In addition, the CT allows evaluation of the right  and left ventricles as well as the lung parenchyma to pro- vide additional information regarding prognosis in acute  pulmonary embolism or alternative diagnosis in the patient  with dyspnea. Magnetic resonance angiography is a rarely  used alternative to the above modalities in patients with  contrast dye allergy. This technique provides the ability to  detect large proximal PEs but lacks reliability for segmental  and subsegmental pulmonary embolism.","

Answer: B. If a patient has a high probability ventilation–perfusion scan, there is a 90% likelihood that the patient does indeed have a pulmonary embolism.

Explanation:
A ventilation-perfusion (VP) scan is a nuclear medicine study used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE). The scan compares the distribution of ventilation (air entering the lungs) and perfusion (blood flow to the lungs) in the lungs. The results are interpreted based on a likelihood scale, with a high probability result indicating a high likelihood of PE. According to the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) study, a high probability VP scan has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 77% for the diagnosis of PE. Therefore, a high probability VP scan result indicates a 90% likelihood that the patient has a PE.

The other statements are not entirely accurate:

A. A high probability VP scan is one that has multiple segments with both ventilation and perfusion defects, not just one segmental perfusion defect.
","D. Multidetector-row spiral CT imaging is suboptimal for detecting small peripheral emboli, necessitating the use of invasive pulmonary angiography.

Explanation:
The statements A, B, C, and E are not entirely accurate.

A. A high probability ventilation–perfusion scan is one that has multiple segmental perfusion defects in the setting of normal ventilation.

B. If a patient has a high probability ventilation–perfusion scan, there is a 50% to 85% likelihood that the patient has a pulmonary embolism.

C. Magnetic resonance angiography provides excellent resolution for both large proximal and smaller segmental pulmonary emboli, but it is not the first-line imaging modality for diagnosing pulmonary embolism due to its availability and longer imaging time.

Treat with dopamine and recombinant tissue plas- minogen activator, 100 mg IV.","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) This patient is presenting with massive pul- monary embolus (pulmonary embolism) with ongoing  hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and profound  hypoxemia requiring 100% oxygen. In this setting, con- tinuing with anticoagulation alone is inadequate, and  the patient should receive circulatory support with fibri- nolysis if there are no contraindications to therapy. The  major contraindications to fibrinolysis include hyperten- sion >180/110 mm Hg, known intracranial disease or  prior hemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery, or trauma. The  recommended fibrinolytic regimen is recombinant tissue   plasminogen activator (rTPA), 100 mg IV over 2 hours.  Heparin should be continued with the fibrinolytic to pre- vent a rebound hypercoagulable state with dissolution of the  clot. There is a 10% risk of major bleeding with fibrinolytic  therapy, with a 1â€“3% risk of intracranial hemorrhage.   The only indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolism  is for massive pulmonary embolism presenting with life- threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and  refractory hypoxemia. In submassive pulmonary embolism  presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of  right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the deci- sion to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case basis.  In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive  circulatory support with vasopressors. Dopamine and  dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treat- ment of shock in pulmonary embolism. Caution should be  taken with ongoing high-volume fluid administration, as  a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly toler- ant of additional fluids. Ongoing fluids may worsen right  ventricular ischemia and further dilate the right ventricle,  displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen  cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contra- indications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized  with vasopressor support, referral for surgical embolec- tomy should be considered. Referral for inferior vena cava  filter placement is not indicated at this time. The patient  should be stabilized hemodynamically as a first priority.  The indications for inferior vena cava filter placement are  active bleeding, precluding anticoagulation, and recurrent  deep-vein thrombosis on adequate anticoagulation.","

Answer: C. Refer for inferior vena cava filter placement and continue current management.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation of syncope, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and a positive Homan's sign with a saddle pulmonary embolus and ongoing clot in the pelvic veins on CT angiography is consistent with a high-risk PE with right heart strain. The patient's low blood pressure, tachycardia, and hypoxia further support this diagnosis. The patient's INR is unknown, and she has been nonadherent to her anticoagulation therapy, making her at high risk for recurrent PE.

The first priority in managing this patient is to stabilize her hemodynamically and improve her oxygenation. She has received a fluid bolus, and her blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing volume depletion. Continuing IV fluids at 500 mL/h for a total of 4 L of fluid resuscitation (Option B) may not be sufficient to improve her blood pressure, and there is a risk of fluid overload.

Referring for surgical embo","
Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing a high-risk pulmonary embolism with evidence of right heart strain and hypotension. Given her history of antiphospholipid syndrome and nonadherence to anticoagulation therapy, she is at increased risk for recurrent thromboembolic events. The patient's current management with unfractionated heparin is a reasonable initial step, but her persistent hypotension and low oxygen saturation suggest that further intervention is necessary.

Given the patient's hemodynamic instability and evidence of right heart strain, the most appropriate next step would be to consider systemic thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to improve her clinical condition and prevent further thromboembolic events. Therefore, option E, ""Treat with dopamine and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 100 mg IV,"" is the correct answer.

However, it is important to note that systemic thrombolysis carries a risk of bleeding, and careful consideration of the patient's bleeding risk factors and the potential benefits and risks of thrombolysis should be weighed",0,1
67,"A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency  department with acute onset of shortness of breath.  She recently had been to visit her parents out of state  and rode in a car for about 9 hours each way. Two  days ago, she developed mild calf pain and swelling,  but she thought that this was not unusual after having  been sitting with her legs dependent for the recent  trip. On arrival to the emergency department, she is  noted to be tachypneic. The vital signs are as follows:     blood pressure of 98/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 114  beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, oxygen  saturation of 92% on room air, and weight of 89 kg.  The lungs are clear bilaterally. There is pain in the  right calf with dorsiflexion of the foot, and the right  leg is more swollen compared with the left.

Tinzaparin 175 U/kg SC once daily D. Unfractionated heparin IV adjusted to maintain  activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two to  three times the upper limit of normal E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2â€“3  Review and Self-Assessment 739","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) Warfarin should not be used alone as ini- tial therapy for the treatment of venous thromboem- bolic disease (VTE) for two reasons. First, warfarin does  not achieve full anticoagulation for at least 5 days, as its  mechanism of action is to decrease the production of  vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagulation factors in the liver.  Second, a paradoxical reaction that promotes coagu- lation may also occur upon initiation of warfarin as it  also decreases the production of the vitamin Kâ€“depen- dent anticoagulants protein C and protein S, which  have shorter half-lives than the procoagulant factors.  For many years, unfractionated heparin delivered intra- venously was the treatment of choice for VTE. How- ever, it requires frequent monitoring of activated partial  thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels and hospitalization  until therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR)  is achieved with warfarin. There are now several safe  and effective alternatives to unfractionated heparin that  can be delivered SC. Low-molecular-weight heparins  (enoxaparin, tinzaparin) are fragments of unfraction- ated heparin with a lower molecular weight. These  compounds have a greater bioavailability, longer half- life, and more predictable onset of action. Their use in  renal insufficiency should be considered with  caution  because low-molecular-weight heparins are renally  cleared. Fondaparinux is a direct factor Xa inhibitor   that, like low-molecular-weight heparins, requires no   Review and Self-Assessment 772 monitoring of anticoagulant effects and has been demon- strated to be safe and effective in treating both deep-vein  thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.","

Answer: E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2–3

Explanation:

Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting the activity of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. It is not an appropriate initial therapy for a pulmonary embolism (PE) because it takes several days for warfarin to reach therapeutic levels. In contrast, the other options listed (enoxaparin, fondaparinux, tinzaparin, and unfractionated heparin) are all parenteral anticoagulants that can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously and have rapid onset of action. These agents are used to prevent further clotting and reduce the risk of complications such as recurrent PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while the patient is being transitioned to long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. In this case, the patient's PE is an acute condition that requires immediate intervention, and warfarin would not be an appropriate initial therapy due to its slow on","E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2–3

Explanation:
The patient is presenting with acute symptoms of pulmonary embolism, including shortness of breath, tachypnea, and right lower extremity pain and swelling. Given the severity of her symptoms and the presence of a confirmed pulmonary embolus, she requires immediate anticoagulation to prevent further clot extension and potential complications.

The options listed include various anticoagulant agents, including low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, tinzaparin), a direct oral anticoagulant (fondaparinux), and a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin).

Warfarin is not an appropriate initial therapy for this patient due to its slow onset of action and the need for frequent monitoring and dose adjustments to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. In contrast, the other options listed (enoxaparin, tinzaparin, and fondaparinux) are all effective and safe options for initial anticoagulation in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.

68,"In general, which of the following is the greatest  risk factor for the development of cancer? A. Age B. Alcohol use C. Cigarette smoking D. Female sex E. Obesity","The answer is A.  (Chap. 26) Although cigarette smoking is the greatest  modifiable risk factor for the development of cancer, the  most significant risk factor for cancer in general is age.  Two-thirds of all cancers are diagnosed in individuals  older than 65 years, and the risk of developing cancer  between the ages of 60 and 79 years is one in three in  men and one in five in women. In contrast, the risk of  cancer between birth and age 49 years is one in 70 for  boys and men and one in 48 for girls and women. Over- all, men have a slightly greater risk of developing cancer  than women (44% vs 38% lifetime risk).","

Answer: A. Age

Explanation: While all the options you provided can increase the risk of developing cancer, age is the greatest risk factor. The risk of developing most cancers increases as we get older. According to the American Cancer Society, about 70% of all cancers are diagnosed in people aged 55 and older. This is because as we age, our cells accumulate damage over time, which can lead to the development of cancer. However, it's important to note that not everyone who gets older will develop cancer, and there are many things we can do to reduce our risk, such as not smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, maintaining a healthy weight, and getting regular screenings.","A. Age
Explanation: The context information does not provide enough detail to definitively answer the query for this specific patient.
