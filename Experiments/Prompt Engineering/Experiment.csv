0,"A S8-year-old man is evaluated for possible smoldering myeloma. Medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. On physical examination, vital signs and other exam- ination flndings are normal. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoflxation show an IgA protein spike of 3.5 g/dl (35 g/L). Bone mar- row biopsy reveals 50% clonal plasma cells. Whole-body low-dose CT scan is negative for bone lesions. Which of the following is the most appropriate imaging test to perform next? (A) Bone scan (B) Skeletal survey (C) Whole-bodyMRI (D) No further testing","Answer:  C Educational Objective: Evaluate smoldering myeloma with whole-body MRL Whole body MRI is the most appropriate imaging test to perfirrm next in this patient (Option C). Smolderir.rg rrultiple myekrml (MM) is characterized by a serum M pnrtein level ot'3 grdL (:10 gi L) or greater (or >500 n'rg,/24 hr <tf urinary r.nonoclonal lree light chains) or bone nlarrow plasnra clonal cells of lO'X, to 59',1, and no evidence of r.uyekrma related signs or syntptoms. All patients with MM should be assessed tbr skeletal lesions at diagnosis, periodically there:rfler. and when new symptoms occur. Skeletal survey fbllowing a negative low dose CT scan would not provicle any value. Low close CT and PE'l CT scan are recomntencled as the ini tial inraging procedure because of increasecl sensitivity. CT is lrref'erred because of its relatively high sensitivity, speed, ancl patient convenience. If initial imaging with rvhole body krw dose CT is negative, whole body MRI is recontntencled. MRI has been fbund to be more sensitive in iclentilying myeloma related bone lesions and soft tissue lesions fron-r plasnracytoma but is more inconvenient fbr the patient. tf' nrore than one lesion greater than 5 mm is discovered, the patient should be considered to have MM requirir.rg therapy. In this patient with smoldering MM. negative finclings r-rn w,hole body low dose CT scan does not exclude skeletal lesions, and MRI is needed for further evaluation. Although bone scans are useful in detecting bone nletilstases fiom underlying cancer, the bone lesions in MM are otten purely lytic and lack the enhanced osteoblast activ ity that is shown by bone scan imaging. Bonc scans should not be used to assess bone involvement in MM (Option A). In the evaluation of MM, advanced cross sectional imagir.rg with whole-body low dose CT, PET CT scan, or wholc body MRI is preferred to a radiographic skeletal sur vey because advanced cross sectional imaging is signifi cantly nrore sensitive and better able to classify the patient's disease and thereby guide therapy (Option B). 'lhe presence or absence of local skeletal lesions on whole body MRI wiil determine the pl:rn of carc ftrr patients with sntoldering MM.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient is intra venous immune gkrbulir.r (IVIC) (Option C). She has pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) characterized by normocytic ane mia with decreased reticukrcytes and absent or decreased erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and with giant proerythroblasts with intranuclear viral inclusions characteristic of parvovirus Bl9 infection. Several condi tions have beer.r implicatecl in the pathogenesis of PRCA, and chief among thern are parvovirus B19 infection, thy moma, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythemato sus), and lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas. Because of her recent chemotherlpy, she is immunocompromised and vulnerable to viral inlections such as parvovirus Bl9, which she may have been exposed to as a kindergarten teacher. Parvovirus infection in adults may be asymptom :rtic or associated with tever, coryza, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. fbtlowed by a rash. ln adults, the classic ""slapped cheek"" rash may not be apparent but other cuta neous manifestations mily occur.

2,"A S5-year-old woman is evaluated before starting che- motherapy for multiple myeloma. Anticipated therapy will include bortezomib, Ienalidomide, dexamethasone, and daily low-dose aspirin. She has otherwise been well, has no symptoms, and has no previous history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or risk factors for VTE. She takes no medications. Today, her hemoglobin level is 9 g/dl (eo s/L). Inactivated influenza and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines will be administered today. The patient received the herpes zoster virus recombinant vaccine at age 50 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional treatment during chemotherapy? (A) Epoetin (B) Fluconazole (C) Metronidazole (D) Valacyclovir","Answer: E Educational Objective: Evaluate a pregnant patient for pulmonary embolism. No further evaluation is needed (Option E). According to the pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm, this patient has a very low probability of having a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has an elevated D dimer measurement, but D dimer levels progressively increase during the course ofpregnancy, making interpretation difficult. To assist in the diagnosis of PE in pregnant women, diagnostic algorithms have been developed. The YEARS criteria have been shown to reduce the risk ofunnecessary CT angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having a PE. The YEARS algorithm assigns I point each for the presence ofthree cardinal criteria: clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis, hemoptysis, and PE as the most likely diagnosis (point range 0-3). The score is used in conjunction with four potential D-dimer results (<0.5 pg/ml lo.s mg/LJ, >0.s pg/ml [o.s mg/L], <1 pg/ml h mg/LJ, and >1 pg/ml [t mg/LJ). This patient met no YEARS clinical criteria and had a D-dimer measurement less than 1 pg/ml (f mg/L). This corresponds to very low risk for PE, so she should not undergo additional testing or anticoagulation. CT pulmonary angiography can be used in pregnancy to diagnose PE, but it exposes the woman to unnecessary radiation ifthe probability ofPE is low such as in this patient (Option A). A perfusion only scan can be used to rule out PE in a pregnant patient, but only after chest radiography has been performed and the results are interpreted as normal (Option B). This patient has a normal respiratory examination and a low probabiligz of PE, so a perlusion only scan is not needed. Similarly, a ventilation perlusion lung scan is unnecessary when the probability of PE is Iow (Option D). MRI with gadolinium can be used to detect pulmonary emboli, but it is an expensive test and not necessary for this patient with low probability for PE (Option C). Gadolin ium should not be used early in pregnancy because of the uncertainty of the effects on the fetus. MRI with gadolinium may be a diagnostic option in select patients in whom neither CT angiography nor ventilation-perfusion scan can be performed. TEY POIXTS . Pregnancy is associated with elevated D dimer meas- urement. o The pregnancy-adapted YEARS criteria along with D dimer measurement can help determine the risk for pulmonary embolism and avoid unnecessary radi ation exposure.",(A)
3,"A 42-year-old woman is evaluated for several months of fatigue. She reports a normal diet and no gastrointestinal symptoms. Medical history is notable for hypothyroidism and vitiligo.

(A) Acyclovir (B) Erythropoietin (C) Intravenous immune globulin (D) Prednisone","Answer: D Educational Objective: Prevent herpes zoster virus reactivation during multiple myeloma treatment. In addition to chemotherapy, this patient should receive pro phylactic therapy with valacyclovir to prevent herpes zoster virus reactivation (Option D). She is immunocompromised because of her plasma cell dyscrasia. Treatment guidelines for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) recommend that those treated with proteasome inhibitors (e.g.. bortezomib) should receive antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir, valacyclo vir) to avoid herpes zoster virus reactivation. Prophylaxis should be administered regardless ol previous immuniza tion against herpes zoster virus. This patient should not receive epoetin. an erythro poietin stimulating agent (ESA) (Option A). The American Society of Clinical Oncologz and the American Society of Hematology recommend restricting ESA use to patients with chemotherapy associated symptomatic anemia when cancer treatment is not curative in intent to reduce the need for erythrocyte transfusions. ESAs are not recom mended for patients whose cancer treatment is curative in intent. given the risk of ESA-related cancer progression. Although this recommendation is viewed by some as con troversial, this patient's anemia is asymptomatic and does not require treatment with either an ESA or erythrocyte transfusion. Antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole or levofloxacin is often administered during induction chemotherapy because of the high rate of infection with gram-negative and encapsulated bacteria during the first 3 months of therapy. Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole has been shown to decrease the number of bacterial infections and serious inf'ections. and levofloxacin prophylaxis has been associated with significantly fewer deaths and febrile episodes during this time period. The planned myeloma treatment is not associated with increased risk of fungal infection; therefore. prophylaxis with flu conazole is not indicated in this patient (Option B). Addi- tionally, metronidazole has no activity against encapsulated bacteria, a common source of infection in patients with MM, and is not indicated (Option C). 90  I Answers and Critiques t([Y PO I ]tr o Treatment guidelines for patients with multiple mye- loma recommend that those treated with proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) should receive antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir, valacyclovir) to avoid herpes zoster virus reactivation.",C) Intravenous immune globulin

Which ofthe following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test? (A) Homocysteine level (B) Methylmalonic acid level (C) Serum folate level (D) Serum vitamin B,, level","Answer: D Educational Objective: Diagnose vitamin B,, deficiency caused by pernicious anemia. The most appropriate diagnostic test fbr this patient is mea suring the serum vitamin 8,, level (Option D). Patients with vitamin B,, deficiency can present with weight loss, glos sitis, and ""lemon yellow"" skin because of pallor and jaun dice resulting from ineffective erythropoiesis. Vitamin B,, deflciency can cause neurologic symptoms, including loss of vibratory sense, loss of proprioception, spastic ataxia, and other dorsal column symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms (megaloblastic mania) can manif'est as dementia, hallucina tions, and lrank psychosis. In patients with vitamin B,, defl ciency, the peripheral blood smear shows oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils. Pancytopenia resulting from ineflective hematopoiesis can also be seen. Other labo ratory flndings are consistent with intramedullary hemolysis caused by ineffective erythropoiesis, including decreased haptoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. The reticulocyte count is low in patients with vitamin B,, deficiency. This patient most likely has vitamin B,, deflciency caused by pernicious ane mia in which autoantibodies to intrinsic factor (lF) prevent the formation of vitamin B,r-lF complexes, resulting in the impaired ability to absorb vitamin B,r. Pernicious anemia can occur as an isolated flnding or with other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo as seen in this patient. An elevated serum homocysteine level has a sensitMty and speciflcity ofgreater than 90'1, in diagnosing folate deflciency and is the preferred test when deficiency is suspected despite a normal serum folate level (Option A). Homocysteine Ievels are also elevated in patients with vitamin 8,, deflcienry, but vitamin B,, measurement is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Serum vitamin B,, is approximately 957, sensitive in the diagnosis of vitamin B,, deficiency in symptomatic patients. Levels greater than 300 pglmL (221pmol/L) effec- tively exclude vitamin B,, deflciency; lower levels may not adequately represent tissue vitamin B,, levels. As such, an elevated concentration of methylmalonic acid is a more sen sitive indicator of vitamin B,, deficiency (Option B). How ever, serum vitamin B,, measurement remains the preferred initial diagnostic test because of its sensitivity. This patient consumes a normal diet and has no gastro intestinal symptoms. Supplemental folate has been added to grains in the United States for many years. As such, dietary folate deflciency is uncommon except in patients with mal nutrition. Folate deflciency has no association with hypothy roidism or vitiligo. Measuring the serum f,olate level would be unnecessary (Option C). KEY POIl{TS . Pernicious anemia, characterized by autoimmune gastritis and intrinsic factor deficiency, is a cause of cobalamin deficiency, which can be evaluated by measuring the serum cobalamin level. r Pemicious anemia can occur as an isolated flnding or with other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo.",B

(A) Chronic myeloid leukemia (B) Occult infection (C) Pravastatin (D) Smoking","Answer: D Educational Objective: Evaluate neutrophilia. Chronic smoking is one of the more common causes of acquired neutrophilia (Option D). How smoking causes an increase in absolute neutrophil count is not entirely clear, but it may be related to inducing an inflammatory process. The degree of neutrophilia appears to be proportional to the amount smoked, and this neutrophilia can persist for a pro longed time even after cessation (for years in some persons). Several other factors can cause an asymptomatic increase in neutrophil count, including asplenia, chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and vigorous exercise. All patients who smoke should be coun seled to stop smoking and should be offered pharmacologic assistance. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may also cause asymptomatic neutrophilia, although patients. not unconl monly, have systemic symptoms or symptoms related to hepatosplenomegaly, which are absent in this patient (Option A). Patients with CML often have increased num bers ol less mature leukocytes, including band tbrms and myelocytes in the peripheral blood. The modest neutrophilia with a normal diflerential, normal peripheral blood smear, and absence of symptoms make smoking or other benign cause a much more likely cause in this patient. Inf'ections are a common cause of leukocytosis. and bacterial infections can cause neutrophilia with a left shitt or presence of'bands, metamyelocytes, or other immature granulocytes in the circulation (Option B). Other findings can include toxic granulations or Dohle bodies seen in circulating neutrophils on review of the peripheral blood smear. In certain severe infections, the leukocyte count can be as high as 1O0,O00/pL (1O0 x fOq/L). Some bacteria are associated with more significant neutrophilia. including clostridial infections. This patient is asymptomatic and has a normal peripheral blood smear, so occult inf'ection is an unlikely cause of his neutrophilia. Some medications can cause an increase in the abso lute neutrophil count. Glucocorticoids cause an increase in release of neutrophils from the bone nrarrort Ml,eloid growth factors (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and lithium are other drugs associated w'ith an increased abso lute neutrophil count.

The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next is bone marrow biopsy (Option A). This patient has symptom atic macrocytic anemia. She has a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation, both of which are independently associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), so evaluation by bone marrow biopsy will provide key information to confirm the suspicion for therapy- related MDS. Patients who develop MDS often present with macrocytic (and often symptomatic) anemia. Bone marrow biopsy aids in establishing the diagnosis and provides prog nostic information, including assessment of the percentage of marrow blasts and cytogenetics. If therapy related MDS is conflrmed, the patient may be evaluated for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although some experts believe that therapy related MDS is a high-risk con dition independent of cytogenetic abnormalities, obtaining cytogenetic and genetic information may identify a target for novel therapies. Colonoscopy is indicated in the evaluation ofiron defl ciency anemia in most men and in postmenopausal women b l,lo ET L'T' a5 l,I (I, =vtE 93  Answers and Critiques (Option B). Macrocytic anemia and concomitant leukopenia and thrombocytopenia would be inconsistent'*,ith iron defl ciency, so colonoscopy would be of little help in evaluating this patient. Immune-mediated hemolysis is characterized by antibody binding to erythrocytes causing complement- mediated and phagocy.te mediated destruction. The lab- oratory hallmark of immune-mediated hemolysis is a positive direct antiglobulin test that detects either IgG or complement (C3) on the erythrocyte surface (Option C). Patients with immune-mediated hemolysis may have ane- mia, fatigue, dyspnea, jaundice, splenomegaly, and reticu- loc1.tosis. Pancytopenia would not be an expected flnding. This patient has pancytopenia and a low reticulocyte count, which are not consistent with immune-mediated hemolysis. A low mean corpuscular volume, elevated red cell dis- tribution width, and peripheral blood smear showing micro- cltosis and anisopoikilocytosis are virtually diagnostic of iron deficiency, especially in premenopausal women. This patient has a macrocytic anemia, and the leukopenia and thrombocy topenia cannot be explained by iron deflcienry.

No further management is needed for this patient (Option E). She has a hemoglobin level greater than 16 g/dl (160 g/L), a low erythropoietin level, and presence of the /AK2 V617F mutation that meet diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV). Some patients may be asymptomatic, with the diagno- sis suspected by flndings on routine complete blood counts; however, many patients have symptoms of fatigue, head- ache, or itching, particularly after a warm shower (aqua genic pruritus). Accompanying splenomegaly may present with abdominal fullness, reflux, or early satiety. Unless con- traindicated, all patients with PV should undergo phlebot- omy to maintain a hematocrit level less than 45'l"" and be treated with low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Additional management depends on risk stratification ofthe patient. This patient's age (<60 years) and lack of thrombosis history categorize her as low risk. Patients at low risk need no additional therapy. Cytoreductive therapy is added for patients with high risk PV. u,hich includes those older than 60 years or r.r'ith a history of thrombosis. Cytoreductive options in PV include hydroxyurea and interferon-a (Options A, C). Ruxolitinib has also been shown to be an effective treatment in those who are intolerant of flrst line agents or with resistant PV (Option D).

A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is the most appropriate choice for this patient (Option C). Her presentation is con- sistent with an acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), most likely warm AIHA (WAIHA). In WAIHA, a polyclonal autoantibody interacts with multiple erythroc,'te antigens, causing extravascular hemolysis. The autoantibody is typically IgG. although it can rarely be IgM or lgA. Splenic macrophages phagocytize the IgG on the erythrocyte. as well as a portion of the membrane, resulting in spherocy'te formation. Patients have evidence of hemolysis, including anemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase level, low hapto globin level, and an indirect bilirubinemia. Reticulocytosis is also seen if no concomitant processes are present that could blunt the compensatory bone marrow response (e.g., iron deflciency). Approximately half of patients with WAIHA will have another underlying disease process. including viral infections, lymphoproliferative diseases. and other autoim mune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

Therefore, evaluating the ADAM1'S13 activity would not be helpful (Option A). ADAMTS13 activity would be expected to be low in the presence of an inhibitor, as in thrombotic thrombocytopen ic pu rpura. A bone marrow biopsy would not be helpful at this time because the patient's increased reticulocyte count and evi dence ofhemolysis indicates a peripheral destructive process causing anemia rather than a defect in the bone marrow (Option B). Osmotic fragility testing is often used to evaluate for hereditary spherocytosis (Option D). 'lhe test uses hypotonic saline incubation to evaluate for increased sensitivity o1' spherocytic erythrocytes to hemolysis. The osmotic ttagil ity test has a relatively low sensitivity ancl specilicity, with positive results being seen in numerous other conditions, including AIHA.'lhe absence of a family history and onset of symptomatic hemolysis at the age of 32 years argue against hereditary spherocy.tosis.

The patient should start granulocy.te colony stimulating fac tor (G CSF) with his next cycle of chemotherapy (Option C). Febrile neutropenia is defined as a single fever of 38.3 'C (101 'F) or sustained fever of 38 'C (100.4'F) in a patient with a current or anticipated absolute neutrophil count less than 500/pL (0.5 x 10e/L). Chemotherapy,induced neutropenia typically occurs within 5 to 15 days lollowing chemother apy. G CSF and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor can be given prophylactically to patients receiving chemotherapy that carries a high risk of neutropenia and as secondary prophylaxis in patients with a previous episode of febrile neutropenia. G CSF administered on day 2 ol the next chemotherapy cycle should reduce the risk ofanother neutropenic f'ever episode. G CSF is not indicated for most patients with neutropenia who are afebrile, as a routine adjunct to empiric antibiotics lor patients presenting with f'ebrile neutropenia, or fbr patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.

Prophylaxis with G CSF is better management for this patient than chemotherapy dose reduction, which might compro mise the potential therapeutic outcome of his treatment. Given the cost, lack of benefit in patients with recovered neutrophil counts, and potential adverse effects, weekly administration of G CSF is not warranted (Option B). G CSF has many potential toxicities, including transient leukope- nia following administration; systemic reactions that may include flulike symptoms, hypertension, and increased risk fbr thrombosis; possible stimulation of malignancy; and production ol neutralizing antibodies.

The structural erythrocyte changes lead to less defbrmability in the microcirculation and increase phago cytosis by macrophages, mainly in the spleen, resulting in hemolysis. Splenomegaly is common. Laboratory flndings include anemia, reticulocytosis, signs of hemolysis. and an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The clinical severity of I-lS varies considerably. Mild forms are common, with normal or near normal hemoglobin lev els, and patients can compensate for the hemolysis. Those with severe forms har,e more brisk hemolysis and a greater degree of anemia, which often worsens at times of oxida tive stress, such as viral infections; pigmented gallstones and aplastic crises from parvovirus infections can also be seen. Treatment depends on disease severity. Mild forms can be monitored. Patients with HS, as with other hemolytic states, have increased folate requirements and should receive supplemental folate. A typical dose for moderate to severe hemolysis is 1to 2 mgiday. In warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. pathogenic lgG antibodies are directed against Rh type antigens on the erythrocyte surface. IgG-coated erythrocytes can be completely phagocytized by splenic macrophages via the Fc receptor and are cleared from the circulation. The basic principle of therapy is alleviating immune destruction of erythrocytes by halting antibody production using gluco corticoids or rituximab (Options B, C). Intravenous immune globulin may be used as adjunctive therapy by blocking mac rophage Fc receptors and preventing erythrocyte destruction in the spleen. Because HS is the result of deficiencies of the erythrocyte membrane proteins and not autoantibodies, prednisone or rituximab is not helpfut. Splenectomy is considered in patients with HS and more signiflcant anemia because the spleen is the pri mary location for erythrocy.te destruction (Option D). Most patients who undergo splenectomy experience an improved hemoglobin level and reduced degree of hemolysis. Typical indications for splenectomy include transfusion dependence or severe symptoms related to anemia. C)ther considerations may include abdominal symptoms related to splenomegaly.

(A) a Thalassemia carrier (B) cr Thalassemia trait (C) 0 Thalassemia minor (D) Hemoglobin E trait","Answer: C Educational Objective: Diagnose the cause of thrombo- cltopenia in a pregnant patient. The most likely diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenic purpura (lTP) (Option C). ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. although it is oFten difficult to distinguish from gestational thrombocytopenia when the thrombocytopenia is mild or noted later in pregnancy. However, features suggesting ITP include earlier presentation (flrst trimester). lower platelet count nadir (<zo,ooo/pL [zo x to""rL]), and history ofthrom bocytopenia befbre pregnancy (even if it was only mild). If the platelet count remains greater than 30.000 pL (30 x 10""/L). the pregnancy is not at risk. Patients should receive intravenous immune globulin or glucocorticoids at any time during pregnancy if the platelet count decreases to less than 30,000/gl- (30 x 10e/L). Because she does not have significant bleeding and her platelet count is greater than 30,000/pL (30 x 10'q/L), she requires no intervention at this time. She will need close follow-up. Gestational thrombocytopenia affects approximately 5'7, of pregnant women (Option A). 'lhe cause is uncertain. Most patients are asymptomatic, with platelet counts greater than 100,000/pL (100 x 10e/L) typical, although platelet counts mav occasionally reach a nadir of 70,000/[L (70 x 10elL). The platelet count does not decrease until late in ges- tation. The fetus is unaffected, intervention is unnecessary. and platelet counts spontaneously return to normal after delivery. The patient's earlier presentation and lower platelet count argue against gestational thrombocytopenia. HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets) syndrome is a thrombotic microangiopathy of preg nancy manifbsting as a severe complication of preeclampsia (Option B). HELLP syndrome typically presents with nonspe ciflc symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea with vomit ing, pruritus, and jaundice, with schistocytes on the periph eral blood smear. HELLP syndrome would be unlikely to cause thrombocytopenia at 16 weeks' gestation, usually pre senting in the latter part of the third trimester. The patient's clinical presentation is not compatible with HELLP syndrome. The patient has no evidence for a microangiopathic hemolysis (no schistocytes on peripheral blood smear) or other symptoms frequently associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura such as fever. fluctuating mental status, or abnormal kidney function (Option D).

19,"A l9-year-old woman is evaluated following a recent diag- nosis of hereditary spherocytosis. She is asymptomatic. She takes no medications. On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The spleen tip is palpable. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dl (ll7 glL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 40 gldL (400 g/L), and reticulocyte count of 6% of eryth- rocytes. Peripheral blood smear shows frequent spherocytes and polychromasia of the erythrocl'tes and reticulocytosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? (A) Folate (B) Prednisone (C) Rituximab (D) Splenectomy","Answer: B Educational Objective: Treat chronic myeloid leukemia. lmatinib is the most appropriate treatment fbr this patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase (Option B). Patients may present in the accelerated (10% 19'l. blasts) or blast phase (>20'1, blasts) of the disease, with blast phase resembling features seen with acute leukemia, but most patients present in the chronic phase (<10'U, blasts in the bone marrow). The hallmark of CML is the Philadel phia chromosome, a reciprocal translocation of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 to the BCR gene on chromosome 22. Patients often present with constitutional symptoms that include night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue, and splenomegaly is common; laboratory studies frequently show marked leukocytosis with a left shift, and basophilia and thrombocytosis can be seen. First line treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as imatinib is con- sidered accepted care for patients with CML in the chronic phase. TKIs bind to the BCR ABL oncoprotein and prevent downstream signaling. Other TKIs include nilotinib and dasatinib. Availability of TKIs has dramatically changed outcomes in CML, with the S-year overall survival in CML exceeding 90'1,. Hydroxyurea is a nonspeciflc myelosuppressive agent that is eflective at reducing granulocyte, erythroc),te, and platelet production in myeloproliferative neoplasms (Option A). It can be used as a temporizing measure to reduce peripheral blood counts while awaiting a flnal diagnosis. However, in those with a conflrmed diagnosis of CML, TKIs are more disease specific and preferred over hydroxyurea. Induction chemotherapy is only considered in some patients with CML in the blast phase (Option C). It would not be appropriate first-line therapy for those with CML in the chronic phase. Stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative option for CML but has signiflcant associated morbidity and mortality (Option D). With the eflicacy and safety of TKIs, the need for transplantation has been substantially reduced. It is typically only considered in patients in the blast phase or in younger patients who do not respond to TKIs. t(EY P0rlrrs .
