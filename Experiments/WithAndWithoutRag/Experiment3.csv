0,"A 39-year-old woman is evaluated for anemia. Her  laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL,  hematocrit of 23.9%, mean corpuscular volume of  72 fL, mean cell hemoglobin of 25 pg, and mean cell  hemoglobin concentration of 28%. The peripheral  smear is shown in Figure 2. Which of the follow- ing tests is most likely to be abnormal in this patient?  A. Ferritin B. Haptoglobin C. Hemoglobin electrophoresis D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase E. Vitamin B12","The answer is A.  (Chap. 2) This patient with anemia demonstrates a low  mean cell volume, low mean cell hemoglobin, and  low mean cell hemoglobin concentration. The periph- eral smear demonstrates microcytic and hypochromic  cells, which would be expected given these laboratory  findings. In addition, there is marked variation in size   Review and Self-Assessment 753 (anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis). These find- ings are consistent with severe iron-deficiency anemia,  and serum ferritin would be expected to be <10 to   15 Î¼g/L. A low haptoglobin level would be seen in cases  of hemolysis, which can be intravascular or extravascu- lar in origin. In intravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would be expected to show poikilocytosis with  the presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells  [RBCs]). In extravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would typically shows spherocytes. Hemoglo- bin electrophoresis is used to determine the presence of  abnormal hemoglobin variants. Sickle cell anemia is the  most common form and demonstrates sickled RBCs.  Thalassemias are also common inherited hemoglobinop- athies. The peripheral smear in thalassemia often shows  target cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi- ciency leads to oxidant-induced hemolysis with presence  of bite cells or blister cells. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads  to macrocytosis, which is not consistent with this case.","C. Hemoglobin electrophoresis

This patient likely has a microcytic, hypochromic anemia, which is commonly seen in iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to identify different types of hemoglobin, so it would be the most likely test to be abnormal in this patient if she has a hemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia. The other tests listed are not typically used to diagnose or evaluate anemia.",A. Ferritin
1,"A 62-year-old man is evaluated for anemia. He has a  hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL (normal hemoglobin value,  15 g/dL), hematocrit of 27.0% (normal hemato- crit, 45%), mean cell volume of 88 fL, mean cell  hemoglobin of 28 pg, and mean cell hemoglobin  concentration of 30%. On peripheral blood smear,  polychromatophilic macrocytes are seen. The retic- ulocyte count is 9%. What is the reticulocyte pro- duction index? A. 0.54 B. 1.67 C. 2.7 D. 4.5 E. 5.4","The answer is C.  (Chap. 2) The reticulocyte index and reticulocyte pro- duction index are useful in the evaluation of anemia to  determine the adequacy of bone marrow response to the  anemia. A normal reticulocyte count is 1â€“2%, and in  the presence of anemia, this would be expected to rise  to more than two to three times the normal value (the  reticulocyte index). The reticulocyte index is calculated  as Reticulocyte count Ã— (Patientâ€™s hemoglobin/Normal  hemoglobin). In this case, the reticulocyte index would  be 5.4%. A second correction is further necessary in this  patient given the presence of polychromatophilic mac- rocytes on peripheral smear. This finding indicates pre- mature release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow  (â€œshift cellsâ€_x009d_), and thus these cells have a longer life span.  It is recommended to further divide the reticulocyte  index by a factor of 2, which is known as the reticulo- cyte production index. In this case, the value would be  2.7%.","The reticulocyte production index (RPI) is calculated using the formula:

RPI = (Patient's reticulocyte count / Normal reticulocyte count) x (Patient's hematocrit / Normal hematocrit)

In this case, the patient's reticulocyte count is 9% and the normal reticulocyte count is typically around 1-2%. The patient's hematocrit is 27% and the normal hematocrit is 45%.

RPI = (9 / 1.5) x (27 / 45) = 6 x 0.6 = 3.6

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is C. 2.7.","The reticulocyte production index (RPI) can be calculated using the formula provided in the context information. Based on the given values, the reticulocyte count is 9% and the hematocrit is 27%. By applying the formula, the correct answer is D. 4.5."
2,"You are asked to review the peripheral blood smear  from a patient with anemia (Figure 4). Serum lac- tate dehydrogenase is elevated, and there is hemo- globinuria. This patient is likely to have which  physical examination finding?  A. Goiter B. Heme-positive stools C. Mechanical second heart sound D. Splenomegaly E. Thickened calvarium","The answer is C. (Chap. 2) This blood smear shows fragmented red blood  cells (RBCs) of varying size and shape. In the presence  of a foreign body within the circulation (prosthetic heart  valve, vascular graft), RBCs can become destroyed.  Such intravascular hemolysis will also cause serum lactate  dehydrogenase to be elevated and hemoglobinuria. In  isolated extravascular hemolysis, there is no hemoglobin  or hemosiderin released into the urine. The characteris- tic peripheral blood smear in splenomegaly is the pres- ence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants within  red blood cells). Certain diseases are associated with  extramedullary hematopoiesis (e.g., chronic hemolytic  anemias), which can be detected by an enlarged spleen,  thickened calvarium, myelofibrosis, or hepatomegaly.  The peripheral blood smear may show teardrop cells  or nucleated RBCs. Hypothyroidism is associated with  macrocytosis, which is not demonstrated here. Chronic  gastrointestinal blood loss will cause microcytosis, not  schistocytes.","D. Splenomegaly

Splenomegaly is a common physical examination finding in patients with hemolytic anemia, which is suggested by the elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and hemoglobinuria in this case. The peripheral blood smear may also show evidence of hemolysis, such as schistocytes or spherocytes. Splenomegaly occurs because the spleen is involved in the removal of damaged red blood cells in hemolytic anemias.",D. Splenomegaly
3,All of the following are common manifestations of  bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease EXCEPT: A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel B. Epistaxis C. Menorrhagia D. Postpartum hemorrhage E. Spontaneous hemarthrosis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 3) von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inher- ited disorder of platelet adhesion that has several types.  The most common type is inherited in an autosomal  dominant fashion and is associated with low levels of  qualitatively normal von Willebrand factor. As a disorder  primary hemostasis associated with the development of  a platelet plug, VWD is primarily associated with muco- sal bleeding. General bleeding symptoms that are more  common in VWD include prolonged bleeding after  surgery or dental procedures, menorrhagia, postpartum  hemorrhage, and large bruises. However, easy bruising  and menorrhagia are common complaints and are not  specific for VWD in isolation. Factors that raise concern  for VWD in women with menstrual symptoms include  iron-deficiency anemia, need for blood transfusion, pas- sage of clots >1 inch in diameter, and need to change a  pad or tampon more than hourly. Epistaxis is also a very  common occurrence in the general population, but it is  the most common complaint of males with VWD. Con- cerning features of epistaxis that may be more likely to  indicate an underlying bleeding diathesis are lack of sea- sonal variation and bleeding that requires medical atten- tion. Although most gastrointestinal bleeding in indi- viduals with VWD is unrelated to the bleeding diathesis,  VWD types 2 and 3 are associated with angiodysplasia  of the bowel and gastrointestinal bleeding. Spontane- ous hemarthroses or deep muscle hematomas are seen  in clotting factor deficiencies and not seen VWD except  severe VWD with associated decreased factor VIII levels  <5%.",A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel,A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel
4,"A 68-year-old man is admitted to the intensive  care unit with spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed- ing and hypotension. He has a medical history of  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney  disease stage III. His medications include lisinopril,  amlodipine, sitagliptin, and glimepiride. On initial  presentation, he is in pain and has a blood pressure  of 70/40 mm Hg with a heart rate of 132 beats/ min. His hemoglobin on admission is 5.3 g/dL  and hematocrit is 16.0%. His coagulation studies  demonstrate an aPTT of 64 seconds and a PT of  12.1 seconds (INR 1.0). Mixing studies (1:1) are  performed. Immediately, the aPTT decreases to   42 seconds. At 1 hour, the aPTT is 56 seconds, and  at 2 hours, it is 68 seconds. Thrombin time and  reptilase time are normal. Fibrinogen is also nor- mal. What is the most likely cause of the patientâ€™s  coagulopathy? A. Acquired factor VIII deficiency B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Lupus anticoagulant E. Vitamin K deficiency FIGURE 4 FIGURE 2  Review and Self-Assessment 727","The answer is B.  (Chap. 3) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) measures the integrity of the intrinsic and com- mon coagulation pathways, and as such, is affected by  all of the coagulation factors, except factor VII. The  aPTT reagent contains phospholipids derived from ani- mal or vegetable sources and includes an activator of  the intrinsic coagulation system, such as nonparticulate  ellagic acid or kaolin. The phospholipid reagent fre- quently varies from laboratory to laboratory. Thus, an  aPTT measured in one hospital may differ from another.  Isolated elevations in the aPTT can be related to fac- tor deficiencies, heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors,  lupus anticoagulant, or the presence of a specific fac- tor inhibitor. To differentiate between the presence of  factor deficiencies and inhibitors, mixing studies should  be performed. Mixing studies are performed by mixing  normal plasma and the patientâ€™s plasma in a 1:1 ratio.  The aPTT and prothrombin time (PT) are incubated at   Review and Self-Assessment 754 37oC, and levels are measured immediately and serially  thereafter for about 2 hours. If the cause is an isolated  factor deficiency, the aPTT should correct to normal  values and remain normal throughout the incubation  period. In the presence of an acquired inhibitor, the  aPTT may or may not correct immediately, but upon  incubation, the inhibitor becomes more active, and the  aPTT will progressively prolong. In contrast, the aPTT  does not correct immediately or with incubation in the  presence of lupus anticoagulants. The presence of serious  bleeding in the presence of mixing studies suggesting  an inhibitor should further rule out lupus anticoagu- lant as a cause because the lupus anticoagulant typically  presents with no symptoms or as a thrombotic disorder.  The mixing studies do not, however, eliminate the pres- ence of heparin as a cause of the prolonged aPTT. If  heparin were present, the thrombin time, but not the  reptilase time, would be prolonged. In this scenario,  both values were normal, ruling out the presence of  heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor. Likewise, dis- seminated intravascular coagulation can be ruled out  in the presence of normal fibrinogen levels. In serious  vitamin K deficiency, both the PT and aPTT should be   prolonged.","B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor

The patient's prolonged aPTT that does not correct with mixing studies suggests the presence of an inhibitor. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor is a rare condition in which the immune system produces antibodies that target and inhibit factor VIII, leading to a coagulopathy. This can result in spontaneous bleeding, as seen in this patient. Other causes of prolonged aPTT, such as heparin or lupus anticoagulant, would typically correct with mixing studies.",The most likely cause of the patient's coagulopathy is D. Lupus anticoagulant.
5,"A 54-year-old man is seen in the clinic complaining  of painless enlargement of lymph nodes in his neck.  He has not otherwise been ill and denies fevers,  chills, weight loss, and fatigue. His past medical  history is remarkable for pulmonary tuberculosis  that was treated 10 years previously under directly  observed therapy. He currently takes no medica- tions. He is a heterosexual man in a monogamous  relationship for 25 years. He denies illicit drug use.  He has smoked 1Â½ packs of cigarettes daily since  16 years of age. He works as a logger. On physical  examination, the patient is thin but not ill-appear- ing. He is not febrile and has normal vital signs.  He has dental caries noted with gingivitis. In the  right supraclavicular area, there is a hard and fixed  lymph node measuring 2.5 Ã— 2.0 cm in size. Lymph  nodes <1 cm in size are noted in the anterior cervi- cal chain. There is no axillary or inguinal lymph- adenopathy. His liver and spleen are not enlarged.  Which of the following factors in history or physi- cal examination increases the likelihood that the  lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy? A. Age older than 50 years B. Location in the supraclavicular area C. Presence of a lymph node that is hard and fixed D. Size >2.25 cm2 (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) E. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 4) Lymphadenopathy has many causes, including  infections, immunologic diseases, and malignancy among  others. In the vast majority of cases, the cause of enlarged  lymph nodes is a benign process. In the primary care  practice, fewer than 1% of individuals will have malig- nancy, and in individuals referred for lymphadenopathy,  this number rises only to 16%. Some features on history  and physical examination lead to an increased likelihood  that the cause of lymphadenopathy is infectious. Fevers  and chills are more commonly present in benign respira- tory illness but can be present in malignancy. Thus, fever  is a nonspecific symptom. Likewise, generalized versus  focal lymphadenopathy is also not specific. The site of  lymph node enlargement can be important and raise  the risk of malignancy. The presence of supraclavicular  lymphadenopathy is never normal. These lymph nodes  drain the thoracic cavity and retroperitoneal space and   are most commonly enlarged in malignancy. However,  infectious etiologies can also cause supraclavicular lymph- adenopathy. The size and texture of the lymph nodes  also provide important information. Nodes <1.0 cm Ã—  1.0 cm are almost always benign, but lymph nodes >2.0 cm   in maximum diameter or with an area of 2.25 cm2  (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) are more likely to be malignant. Nodes  containing metastatic cancer tend to be described as  hard, fixed, and nontender. In lymphoma, however,  the nodes can be tender because of rapid enlargement  of the node with subsequent stretching of the capsule of   the lymph nodes. Lymphomatous nodes are also fre- quently described as firm, rubbery, and mobile.","E. All of the above

All of the factors listed in the options (age older than 50 years, location in the supraclavicular area, presence of a lymph node that is hard and fixed, and size >2.25 cm2) increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy. These factors are commonly associated with malignancies such as lymphoma or metastatic cancer.",E. All of the above
6,"A 24-year-old woman presents for a routine  checkup and complains only of small masses in her  groin. She states that they have been present for at  least 3 years. She denies fever, malaise, weight loss,  and anorexia. She works as a sailing instructor and  competes in triathlons. On physical examination,  she is noted to have several palpable 1-cm inguinal  lymph nodes that are mobile, nontender, and dis- crete. There is no other lymphadenopathy or focal  findings on examination. What should be the next  step in management? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis C. Excisional biopsy D. Fine-needle aspiration for culture and cytopathology E. Pelvic ultrasonography F. Reassurance","The answer is F.  (Chap. 4) This patientâ€™s lymphadenopathy is benign.  Inguinal nodes smaller than 2 cm are common in the  population at large and need no further workup pro- vided that there is no other evidence of disseminated  infection or tumor and that the nodes have qualities that  do not suggest tumor (not hard or matted). A practi- cal approach would be to measure the nodes or even  photograph them if visible and follow them serially over  time. Occasionally, inguinal lymph nodes can be associ- ated with sexually transmitted diseases. However, these  are usually ipsilateral and tender, and evaluation includes  bimanual examination and appropriate cultures, not nec- essarily pelvic ultrasonography. A total-body CT scan  would be indicated if other pathologic nodes suggestive  of lymphoma or granulomatous disease are present in  other anatomic locations. Bone marrow biopsy would  be indicated only if a diagnosis of lymphoma is made  first.","C. Excisional biopsy

Given the patient's history of small masses in the groin that have been present for at least 3 years, and her occupation as a sailing instructor and participation in triathlons, it is important to rule out any potential malignancy. An excisional biopsy of the inguinal lymph nodes would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.",C. Excisional biopsy
7,All of the following diseases are associated with  massive splenomegaly (spleen extends 8 cm below  the costal margin or weighs >1000 g) EXCEPT: A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension D. Marginal zone lymphoma E. Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 4) Portal hypertension causes splenomegaly via  passive congestion of the spleen. It generally causes only  mild enlargement of the spleen because expanded varices  provide some decompression for elevated portal pres- sures. Myelofibrosis necessitates extramedullary hemato- poiesis in the spleen, liver, and even other sites such as  the peritoneum, leading to massive splenomegaly caused  by myeloid hyperproduction. Autoimmune hemolytic  anemia requires the spleen to dispose of massive amounts  of damaged red blood cells, leading to reticuloendothe- lial hyperplasia and frequently an extremely large spleen.  Chronic myeloid leukemia and other leukemias and  lymphomas can lead to massive splenomegaly caused by  infiltration with an abnormal clone of cells. Marginal  zone lymphoma typically presents with splenomegaly. If  a patient with cirrhosis or right heart failure has mas- sive splenomegaly, a cause other than passive congestion  should be considered.","C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension

Cirrhosis with portal hypertension is not typically associated with massive splenomegaly.",B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
8,"The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bod- ies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood  cells in a patient with hairy cell leukemia before  any treatment intervention implies which of the  following? A. Diffuse splenic infiltration by tumor B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) C. Hemolytic anemia D. Pancytopenia E. Transformation to acute leukemia","The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear  remnants), Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin), baso- philic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) in  the peripheral blood implies that the spleen is not properly  clearing senescent or damaged RBCs from the circula- tion. This usually occurs because of surgical splenectomy  but is also possible when there is diffuse infiltration of  the spleen with malignant cells. Hemolytic anemia can  have various peripheral smear findings depending on the  etiology of the hemolysis. Spherocytes and bite cells are  an example of damaged RBCs that might appear because  of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and oxidative dam- age, respectively. Disseminated intravascular coagulation  is characterized by schistocytes and thrombocytopenia  on smear with an elevated international normalized ratio   Review and Self-Assessment 755 and activated partial thromboplastin time as well. How- ever, in these conditions, damaged RBCs are still cleared  effectively by the spleen. Transformation to acute leuke- mia does not lead to splenic damage.","C. Hemolytic anemia

These findings are characteristic of hemolytic anemia, which is common in patients with hairy cell leukemia due to the destruction of red blood cells by the abnormal leukemia cells.",C. Hemolytic anemia
9,Which of the following is true regarding infection  risk after elective splenectomy? A. Patients are at no increased risk of viral infection  after splenectomy. B. Patients should be vaccinated 2 weeks after splenec- tomy. C. Splenectomy patients over the age of 50 are at great- est risk for postsplenectomy sepsis. D. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly impli- cated organism in postsplenectomy sepsis. E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases  with time.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) Splenectomy leads to an increased risk of  overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, an infection  that carries an extremely high mortality rate. The most  commonly implicated organisms are encapsulated. Strep- tococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and sometime  gram-negative enteric organisms are most frequently  isolated. There is no known increased risk for any viral  infections. Vaccination for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae,  and Neisseria meningitidis is indicated for any patient who  may undergo splenectomy. The vaccines should be  given at least 2 weeks before surgery. The highest risk  of sepsis occurs in patients younger than 20 years of age  because the spleen is responsible for first-pass immunity,  and younger patients are more likely to have primary  exposure to implicated organisms. The risk is highest  during the first 3 years after splenectomy and persists at a  lower rate until death.",E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases with time.,E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases with time.
10,"An 18-year-old man is seen in consultation for a  pulmonary abscess caused by infection with Staph- ylococcus aureus. He had been in his usual state of  health until 1 week ago when he developed fevers  and a cough. He has no ill contacts and presents in  the summer. His medical history is significant for  episodes of axillary and perianal abscesses requiring  incision and drainage. He cannot specifically recall  how often this has occurred, but he does know it has  been more than five times that he can recall. In one  instance, he recalls a lymph node became enlarged  to the point that it â€œpoppedâ€_x009d_ and drained sponta- neously. He also reports frequent aphthous ulcers  and is treated for eczema. On physical examination,  his height is 5â€²3â€³. He appears ill with a temperature  of 39.6Â°C. Eczematous dermatitis is present in the  scalp and periorbital area. There are crackles at the  left lung base. Axillary lymphadenopathy is present  bilaterally and is tender. The spleen in enlarged. His  laboratory studies show a white blood cell count of  12,500/Î¼L (94% neutrophils), hemoglobin of 11.3  g/dL, hematocrit of 34.2%, and platelets of 320,000/ Î¼L. Granulomatous inflammation is seen on lymph   Review and Self-Assessment 728    node biopsy. Which of the following tests are most  likely found in this patient? A. Elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level B. Eosinophilia C. Giant primary granules in neutrophils D. Mutations of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor E. Positive nitroblue tetrazolium dye test","The answer is E.  (Chap. 5) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an  inherited disorder of abnormal phagocyte function. Sev- enty percent of cases are inherited in an X-linked fashion  with the other 30% being autosomal recessive. Affected  individuals are susceptible to infectious with catalase- positive organisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus. Other  organisms that can be seen include Burkholderia cepacia,  Aspergillus spp., and Chromobacterium violaceum. Most  individuals present in childhood, and infections com- monly affect the skin, ears, lungs, liver, and bone. Exces- sive inflammatory reaction can lead to suppuration of  lymph nodes, and granulomatous inflammation can be  seen on lymph node biopsy and found in the gastro- intestinal and genitourinary tracts. Aphthous ulcers and  eczematous skin rash can also be seen. The underlying  genetic defect in CGD is the inability of neutrophils and  monocytes to generate the appropriate oxidative burst in  response to infectious organisms. Several mutations can  lead to the disease, and these affect one of the five sub- units of the NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) oxidase enzyme. The test of choice to  diagnose chronic granulomatous disease is the nitroblue  tetrazolium dye test, which demonstrates lack of super- oxide and hydrogen peroxide production in the face of  an appropriate stimulus.","D. Mutations of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor

This patient likely has chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to defects in the phagocytic cells' ability to produce reactive oxygen species. Mutations in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections, as seen in this patient with recurrent abscesses and pulmonary abscess. The other answer choices are not typically associated with CGD.",A. Elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level
11,"A 72-year-old man with chronic obstructive pul- monary disease and stable coronary disease presents  to the emergency department with several days of  worsening productive cough, fevers, malaise, and  diffuse muscle aches. A chest radiograph demon- strates a new lobar infiltrate. Laboratory measure- ments reveal a total white blood cell count of 12,100  cells/Î¼L with a neutrophilic predominance of 86%  and 8% band forms. He is diagnosed with commu- nity-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotic treatment  is initiated. Under normal, or â€œnonstress,â€_x009d_ condi- tions, what percentage of the total body neutrophils  are present in the circulation? A. 2% B. 10% C. 25% D. 40% E. 90%","The answer is A.  (Chap. 5) Under normal or nonstress conditions, roughly  90% of the neutrophil pool is in the bone marrow, 2â€“3%  in the circulation, and the remainder in the tissues. The  circulating pool includes the freely flowing cells in the  bloodstream and the others are marginated in close prox- imity to the endothelium. Most of the marginated pool is  in the lung, which has a vascular endothelium surface area.  Margination in the postcapillary venules is mediated by  selectins that cause a low-affinity neutrophilâ€“endothelial  cell interaction that mediates â€œrollingâ€_x009d_ of the neutrophils  along the endothelium. A variety of signals, including  interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor Î±, and other che- mokines, can cause leukocytes to proliferate and leave  the bone marrow and enter the circulation. Neutrophil  integrins mediate the stickiness of neutrophils to endo- thelium and are important for chemokine-induced cell  activation. Infection causes a marked increase in bone  marrow production of neutrophils that marginate and  enter tissue. Acute glucocorticoids increase neutrophil  count by mobilizing cells from the bone marrow and  marginated pool.","B. 10%

Under normal conditions, approximately 10% of total body neutrophils are present in the circulation. The majority of neutrophils are stored in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream in response to infection or inflammation.",C. 25%
12,"A patient with longstanding HIV infection, alco- holism, and asthma is seen in the emergency depart- ment for 1â€“2 days of severe wheezing. He has not  been taking any medicines for months. He is admit- ted to the hospital and treated with nebulized ther- apy and systemic glucocorticoids. His CD4 count is  8 and viral load is >750,000. His total white blood  cell (WBC) count is 3200 cells/Î¼L with 90% neu- trophils. He is accepted into an inpatient substance  abuse rehabilitation program and before discharge  is started on opportunistic infection prophylaxis,  bronchodilators, a prednisone taper over 2 weeks,  ranitidine, and highly active antiretroviral therapy.  The rehabilitation center pages you 2 weeks later; a  routine laboratory check reveals a total WBC count  of 900 cells/Î¼L with 5% neutrophils. Which of the  following new drugs would most likely explain this  patientâ€™s neutropenia? A. Darunavir B. Efavirenz C. Ranitidine D. Prednisone E. Trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole","The answer is E.  (Chap. 5) Many drugs can lead to neutropenia, most  commonly via retarding neutrophil production in   the bone marrow. Of the list in the answer choices, tri- methoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole is the most likely culprit.  Other common causes of drug-induced neutropenia  include alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or  busulfan, antimetabolites including methotrexate and  5-flucytosine, penicillin and sulfonamide antibiotics,  antithyroid drugs, antipsychotics, and anti-inflammatory  agents. Prednisone, when used systemically, often causes  an increase in the circulating neutrophil count because  it leads to demargination of neutrophils and bone mar- row stimulation. Ranitidine, an H2 blocker, is a well- described cause of thrombocytopenia but has not been  implicated in neutropenia. Efavirenz is a nonnucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor whose main side effects  include a morbilliform rash and central nervous system  effects, including strange dreams and confusion. The  presence of these symptoms does not require drug ces- sation. Darunavir is a new protease inhibitor that is well  tolerated. Common side effects include a maculopapu- lar rash and lipodystrophy, a class effect for all protease  inhibitors.","E. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a common antibiotic used for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in patients with HIV. Neutropenia is a known side effect of this medication. Given the patient's history of HIV infection and low CD4 count, it is likely that the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the cause of his neutropenia.",E. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
13,All the following are suggestive of iron-deficiency  anemia EXCEPT: A. Koilonychia B. Pica C. Decreased serum ferritin D. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) E. Low reticulocyte response,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 7) Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition con- sisting of anemia and clear evidence of iron deficiency.  It is one of the most prevalent forms of malnutrition.  Globally, 50% of anemia is attributable to iron deficiency  and accounts for approximately 841,000 deaths annu- ally worldwide. Africa and parts of Asia bear 71% of the  global mortality burden; North America represents only  1.4% of the total morbidity and mortality associated with  iron deficiency. Initially, a state of negative iron balance  occurs during which iron stores become slowly depleted.  Serum ferritin may decrease, and the presence of stain- able iron on bone marrow preparation decreases. When   Review and Self-Assessment 756 iron stores are depleted, serum iron begins to fall. Total  iron-binding capacity (TIBC) starts to increase, reflecting  the presence of circulating unbound transferrin. When  the transferrin saturation falls to 15â€“20%, hemoglobin  synthesis is impaired. The peripheral blood smear reveals  the presence of microcytic and hypochromic red blood  cells. Reticulocytes may also become hypochromic.  Reticulocyte numbers are reduced relative to the level  of anemia, reflecting a hypoproduction anemia second- ary to iron deficiency. Clinically, these patients exhibit  the usual signs of anemia, which are fatigue, pallor, and  reduced exercise capacity. Cheilosis and koilonychia are  signs of advanced tissue iron deficiency. Some patients  may experience pica, a desire to ingest certain materials,  such as ice (pagophagia) and clay (geophagia).",D. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC),A. Koilonychia
14,A 24-year-old man with a history of poorly treated  chronic ulcerative colitis is found to have ane- mia with a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and a reduced  mean corpuscular volume. His ferritin is 250 Î¼g/L.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of  his anemia? A. Folate deficiency B. Hemoglobinopathy C. Inflammation D. Iron deficiency E. Sideroblastic anemia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) (See Table 7-4.) The differential diagnosis of  microcytic anemia includes iron deficiency, hemoglo- binopathy (e.g., thalassemia), myelodysplastic syndromes  (including sideroblastic anemia), and chronic inflamma- tion. Inflammation can be distinguished from iron defi- ciency because iron deficiency typically includes a very  low ferritin level (<50 Î¼g/L) and iron binding satura- tion, but in inflammation, they are normal or increased.  Any chronic inflammatory state may cause a hypopro- liferative anemia caused by inadequate marrow utiliza- tion of iron related to hyperproduction of a number of  cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon- gamma, and interleukin-1. The anemia of chronic dis- ease may be normocytic/normochromic or microcytic.  Serum iron and iron binding are normal to high in  thalassemia and sideroblastic anemia. Folate deficiency  causes macrocytic anemia.","C. Inflammation

Inflammation is the most likely cause of anemia in this patient with chronic ulcerative colitis. Chronic inflammation can lead to anemia of chronic disease, also known as anemia of inflammation. This type of anemia is characterized by low hemoglobin levels, reduced mean corpuscular volume, and normal to high ferritin levels. Inflammation can interfere with iron metabolism and lead to decreased iron availability for red blood cell production, even if the patient has normal or high ferritin levels.",D. Iron deficiency
15,All of the following statements regarding the ane- mia of chronic kidney disease are true EXCEPT: A. The degree of anemia correlates with the stage of  chronic kidney disease. B. Erythropoietin levels are reduced. C. Ferritin is reduced. D. It is typically normocytic and normochromic. E. Reticulocytes are decreased.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is  usually associated with a moderate to severe hypoprolif- erative anemia. The level of the anemia correlates with  the stage of CKD. Red blood cells (RBCs) are typically  normocytic and normochromic, and reticulocytes are  decreased. The anemia is primarily caused by a failure  of erythropoietin (EPO) production by the diseased kid- ney and a reduction in RBC survival. Polycystic kidney  disease shows a smaller degree of EPO deficiency for a  given level of renal failure. By contrast, patients with  diabetes or myeloma have more severe EPO deficiency  for a given level of renal failure. Assessment of iron sta- tus provides information to distinguish the anemia of  CKD from other forms of hypoproliferative anemia  and to guide management. Patients with the anemia of  CKD usually present with normal serum iron, total iron- binding capacity, and ferritin levels. However, those  maintained on chronic hemodialysis may develop iron  deficiency from blood loss through the dialysis proce- dure. EPO therapy is effective in correcting the anemia  of CKD. Iron must be replenished in patients with con- comitant iron deficiency to ensure an adequate response  to EPO therapy.","C. Ferritin is reduced. 

Ferritin levels are typically elevated in chronic kidney disease due to inflammation and decreased clearance by the kidneys.",A. The degree of anemia correlates with the stage of chronic kidney disease.
16,All of the following statements regarding the utility  of hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease  are true EXCEPT: A. It is effective in reducing painful crises. B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production  of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow. C. It should be considered in patients with repeated  acute chest syndrome episodes. D. Its mechanism involves increasing production of fetal  hemoglobin. E. The major adverse effect is a reduction in white  blood cell count.,"The answer is B. (Chap. 8, MM Hsieh et al: N Engl J Med 2009;361:2309â€“2317)  The most significant recent advance in the therapy of  sickle cell anemia has been the introduction of hydroxy- urea as a mainstay of therapy for patients with severe  symptoms. Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin and  may exert beneficial effects on red blood cell (RBC)  hydration, vascular wall adherence, and suppression of  the granulocyte and reticulocyte counts. Hemoglobin  F levels increase in most patients within a few months.  Hydroxyurea should be considered in patients experienc- ing repeated episodes of acute chest syndrome or with  more than three crises per year requiring hospitaliza- tion. The utility of this agent for reducing the incidence  of other complications (priapism, retinopathy) is under  evaluation, as are the long-term side effects. Hydroxy- urea offers broad benefits to most patients whose disease  is severe enough to impair their functional status, and it  may improve survival. The main adverse effect is a reduc- tion in white blood cell (WBC) count; dosage should  be titrated to maintain a WBC count at 5000 to 8000/ Î¼L. WBCs and reticulocytes may play a major role in  the pathogenesis of sickle cell crisis, and their suppression  may be an important benefit of hydroxyurea therapy. A  recent study demonstrated that nonmyeloablative bone  marrow transplantation in patients with sickle cell dis- ease could produce a stable chimera that corrected RBC  counts and reversed the sickle cell phenotype.","B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow. 

This statement is not true. Hydroxyurea works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin, not hemoglobin A.",B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow.
17,Which of the following is the most cost-effective  test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin  (vitamin B12) deficiency? A. Red blood cell folate B. Serum cobalamin C. Serum homocysteine D. Serum methylmalonate E. Serum pepsinogen  Review and Self-Assessment 729,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 9) Serum cobalamin is measured by an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay test and is the most cost- effective test to rule out deficiency. Normal serum  levels are typically above 200 ng/L. In patients with  megaloblastic anemia caused by cobalamin deficiency,  the level is usually <100 ng/L. In general, the more  severe the deficiency, the lower the serum cobalamin  level. In patients with spinal cord damage caused by the  deficiency, levels are very low even in the absence of  anemia. Borderline low levels may occur in pregnancy  in patients with megaloblastic anemia caused by folate  deficiency. In patients with cobalamin deficiency suf- ficient to cause anemia or neuropathy, the serum meth- ylmalonate (MMA) level is increased. Serum MMA and  homocysteine levels have been proposed for the early  diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency even in the absence of  hematologic abnormalities or subnormal levels of serum  cobalamin. Serum MMA levels fluctuate, however, in  patients with renal failure. Mildly elevated serum MMA  or homocysteine levels occur in up to 30% of apparently  healthy volunteers and 15% of elderly subjects. These  findings bring into question the exact cutoff points for   Review and Self-Assessment 757 normal MMA and homocysteine levels. It is also unclear  at present whether these mildly increased metabolite lev- els have clinical consequences. Serum homocysteine is  increased in both early cobalamin and folate deficiency  but may also be increased in other conditions (e.g.,  chronic renal disease; alcoholism; smoking; pyridoxine  deficiency; hypothyroidism; and therapy with steroids,  cyclosporine, and other drugs). The red blood cell folate  assay is a test of body folate stores. It is less affected than  the serum assay by recent diet and traces of hemolysis.  Subnormal levels occur in patients with megaloblastic  anemia caused by folate deficiency but also in nearly  two-thirds of patients with severe cobalamin deficiency.  False-normal results may occur if a folate-deficient  patient has received a recent blood transfusion or if a  patient has an increased reticulocyte count. Serum pep- sinogen may be low in patients with pernicious anemia.","B. Serum cobalamin

Serum cobalamin (vitamin B12) levels are the most cost-effective test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin deficiency. Low levels of serum cobalamin are indicative of a deficiency, which can lead to symptoms such as anemia, fatigue, and neurological problems. Other tests such as serum homocysteine and serum methylmalonate can also be useful in diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, but serum cobalamin is typically the first test ordered due to its cost-effectiveness.",D. Serum methylmalonate
18,A patient being evaluated for anemia has the periph- eral blood smear shown in Figure 20. Which of  the following is the most likely cause of the anemia?  A. Acute lymphocytic leukemia B. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13 C. Cobalamin deficiency D. Epstein-Barr virus infection E. Iron deficiency,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 9) The peripheral blood smear shows hypochro- masia, macrocytosis, and a hypersegmented (>five lobes)  neutrophil. These findings are typical for a megaloblastic  anemia as seen in cobalamin or folate deficiency. The  mean corpuscular volume is typically >100 fL, and there  is significant anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. There may  also be leukopenia and thrombocytopenia that corre- late with the degree of deficiency. Other less common  causes of megaloblastic anemia include therapy with  drugs that interfere with folate metabolism (methotrex- ate) or DNA synthesis (hydroxyurea, AZT, cytosine  arabinoside, 6-mercaptopurine) and some cases of acute  myeloblastic leukemia or myelodysplasia. Autoantibod- ies to ADAMTS-13 are associated with thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura, which causes a microangio- pathic hemolytic anemia. Epstein-Barr virus infection is  associated with large atypical lymphocytes, not hyper- segmented neutrophils. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  microcytic hypochromic anemia.","E. Iron deficiency

Iron deficiency is the most likely cause of the anemia in this case. The peripheral blood smear shows microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells, which are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, and a deficiency in iron can lead to decreased red blood cell production and subsequent anemia.",C. Cobalamin deficiency
19,Patients from which of the following regions need  not be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydro- genase (G6PD) deficiency when starting a drug that  carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis? A. Brazil B. Russia C. Southeast Asia D. Southern Europe E. Sub-Saharan Africa F. None of the above,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) Red blood cells (RBCs) use glutathione  produced by the hexose monophosphate shunt to com- pensate for increased production of reactive oxygen spe- cies (oxidant stress), usually induced by drugs or toxins.  Defects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)  are the most common congenital hexose monophos- phate shunt defect. If the RBC is unable to maintain  an adequate level of glutathione during oxidant stress,  hemoglobin precipitates in the RBC, producing Heinz  bodies. Because the G6PD gene is on the X chromo- some, almost all affected patients are males. G6PD defi- ciency is widely distributed throughout regions that are  currently or were once highly malarial endemic. It is  common in males of African, African American, Sardin- ian, and Sephardic descent. In most persons with G6PD  deficiency, there is no evidence of symptomatic disease.  However, infection, ingestion of fava beans, or exposure  to an oxidative agent (drug or toxin) can trigger an acute  hemolytic event. Bite cells, Heinz bodies, and bizarre  poikilocytes may be evident on smear. The drugs that  most commonly precipitate a G6PD crisis include dap- sone, sulfamethoxazole, primaquine, and nitrofurantoin.  The anemia is often severe with rapid onset after drug  ingestion, and renal failure can occur.","F. None of the above

Patients from all regions listed should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency before starting a drug that carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis.",Patients from Southeast Asia need not be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency when starting a drug that carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis.
20,"A 36-year-old African American woman with sys- temic lupus erythematosus presents with the acute  onset of lethargy and jaundice. On initial evalua- tion, she is tachycardic and hypotensive, appears  pale, is dyspneic, and is somewhat difficult to  arouse. Physical examination reveals splenomegaly.  Her initial hemoglobin is 6 g/dL, white blood cell  count is 6300/Î¼L, and platelets are 294,000/Î¼L.  Her total bilirubin is 4 g/dL, reticulocyte count  is 18%, and haptoglobin is not detectable. Renal  function is normal, as is urinalysis. What would you  expect on her peripheral blood smear? A. Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes  with hypersegmented nuclei B. Microspherocytes C. Schistocytes D. Sickle cells E. Target cells","The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) This patientâ€™s lupus and her rapid develop- ment of truly life-threatening hemolytic anemia are  both very suggestive of autoimmune hemolytic ane- mia. Diagnosis is made by a positive Coombs test result  documenting antibodies to the red cell membrane, but  smear will often show microspherocytes, indicative of  the damage incurred to the red cells in the spleen. Schis- tocytes are typical for microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mias such as hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura. The lack of thrombocyto- penia makes these diagnoses considerably less plausible.  Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes with  hypersegmented nuclei are very suggestive of vitamin  B12 deficiency, which causes more chronic, nonâ€“life- threatening anemia. Target cells are seen in liver disease  and thalassemias. Sickle cell anemia is associated with  aplastic crises, but this patient has no known diagnosis of  sickle cell disease and is showing evidence of erythropoi- etin response based on the presence of elevated reticu- locyte count.","C. Schistocytes

Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells that are often seen in conditions such as hemolytic anemia, where red blood cells are being destroyed prematurely. In this case, the patient's presentation with jaundice, anemia, and splenomegaly is consistent with hemolysis, and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear would support this diagnosis.",C. Schistocytes
21,"A 22-year-old pregnant woman of northern Euro- pean descent presents 3 months into her first preg- nancy with extreme fatigue, pallor, and icterus. She  reports being previously healthy. On evaluation,  her hemoglobin is 8 g/dL with a normal mean cor- puscular volume and an elevated mean corpuscu- lar hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count  of 9%, and indirect bilirubin of 4.9 mg/dL; serum  haptoglobin is not detectable. Her peripheral smear  is shown in Figure 23. Her physical examination  is notable for splenomegaly and a normal 3-month  uterus. What is the most likely diagnosis?  A. Colonic polyp B. G6PD deficiency C. Hereditary spherocytosis D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","The answer is C.  (Chap. 10) The peripheral blood smear shows micro- spherocytes, small densely staining red blood cells  (RBCs) that have lost their central pallor characteris- tic of hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytosis is almost  the only condition with an increased mean corpuscular  hemoglobin concentration. Hereditary spherocytosis is a  heterogeneous RBC membranopathy that can be either  congenital (usually autosomal dominant) or acquired; it  is characterized by predominantly extravascular hemo- lysis in the spleen caused by defects in membrane struc- tural proteins. This spleen-mediated hemolysis leads to  the conversion of classic biconcave RBCs on smear to  spherocytes. Splenomegaly is common. This disorder  can be severe, depending on the site of mutation, but  is often overlooked until some stressor such as preg- nancy leads to a multifactorial anemia, or an infection  such as parvovirus B19 transiently eliminates RBC pro- duction altogether. Acute treatment is with transfusion.  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency  is a cause of hemolysis that is usually triggered by the  presence of an offending oxidative agent. The peripheral  blood smear may show Heinz bodies. Parvovirus infec- tion may cause a pure RBC aplasia. The presence of  active reticulocytosis and laboratory findings consistent   Review and Self-Assessment 758 with hemolysis are not compatible with that diagnosis.  Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, such as caused by a  colonic polyp, would cause a microcytic, hypochromic  anemia without evidence of hemolysis (indirect biliru- bin, haptoglobin abnormalities).","C. Hereditary spherocytosis

The peripheral smear showing spherocytes is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic disorder that results in the production of red blood cells that are spherical in shape rather than the normal biconcave disc shape. This can lead to hemolysis, resulting in symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, and icterus. The presence of splenomegaly is also common in hereditary spherocytosis. Other laboratory findings, such as an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and a reticulocyte count, are also consistent with hemolysis.",C. Hereditary spherocytosis
22,"The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis,  and pancytopenia suggests which of the following   diagnoses? A. Acute promyelocytic leukemia B. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) C. Leptospirosis D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) FIGURE 23 FIGURE 20  Review and Self-Assessment 730","The answer is D. (Chap. 10) Each of the listed diagnoses has a rather char- acteristic set of laboratory findings that are virtually diag- nostic for the disease once the disease has progressed to a  severe stage. The combination of portal vein thrombo- sis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is typical for paroxysmal  nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare disor- der characterized by hemolytic anemia (particularly at  night), venous thrombosis, and deficient hematopoiesis.  It is a stem cellâ€“derived intracorpuscular defect. Ane- mia is usually moderate in severity, and there is often  concomitant granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.  Venous thrombosis occurs much more commonly than  in the population at large. The intraabdominal veins are  often involved, and patients may present with Budd- Chiari syndrome. Cerebral sinus thrombosis is a com- mon cause of death in patients with PNH. The presence  of pancytopenia and hemolysis should raise suspicion for  this diagnosis even before the development of a venous  thrombosis. In the past, PNH was diagnosed by abnor- malities on the Ham or sucrose lysis test; however, cur- rently flow cytometry analysis of glycosylphosphati- dylinositol (GPI) linked proteins (e.g., CD55 and CD59)  on red blood cells and granulocytes is recommended.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) both cause hemolysis  and thrombocytopenia, as well as fevers. Cerebrovascu- lar events and mental status change occur more com- monly in TTP, and renal failure is more common in  HUS. Severe leptospirosis, or Weilâ€™s disease, is notable  for fevers, hyperbilirubinemia, and renal failure. Con- junctival suffusion is another helpful clue. Acute promy- elocytic leukemia is notable for anemia, thrombocytope- nia, and either elevated or a decreased white blood cell  count, all in the presence of disseminated intravascular  coagulation.",D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
23,All of the following laboratory values are consistent  with an intravascular hemolytic anemia EXCEPT: A. Increased haptoglobin B. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) C. Increased reticulocyte count D. Increased unconjugated bilirubin E. Increased urine hemosiderin,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 10) Haptoglobin is an Î±-globulin normally pres- ent in serum. It binds specifically to the globin portion of  hemoglobin, and the complex is cleared by the mono- nuclear cell phagocytosis. Haptoglobin is reduced in all  hemolytic anemias because it binds free hemoglobin. It  can also be reduced in cirrhosis and so is not diagnostic of  hemolysis outside of the correct clinical context. Assum- ing normal bone marrow and iron stores, the reticulo- cyte count will be elevated as well to try to compensate  for the increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction of  hemolysis. Release of intracellular contents from the  RBC (including hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase)  induces heme metabolism, producing unconjugated bili- rubinemia. If the haptoglobin system is overwhelmed,  the kidney will filter free hemoglobin and reabsorb it in  the proximal tubule for storage of iron by ferritin and  hemosiderin. Hemosiderin in the urine is a marker of fil- tered hemoglobin by the kidneys. In massive hemolysis,  free hemoglobin may be excreted in urine.","A. Increased haptoglobin

Haptoglobin is a protein that binds free hemoglobin in the blood and helps prevent its loss through the kidneys. In intravascular hemolytic anemia, there is an increased breakdown of red blood cells, leading to an increase in free hemoglobin in the blood. This would result in decreased haptoglobin levels, not increased levels.",A. Increased haptoglobin
24,Which of the following hemolytic anemias can be  classified as extracorpuscular? A. Elliptocytosis B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria C. Pyruvate kinase deficiency D. Sickle cell anemia E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 10) Hemolytic anemias may be classified as intra- corpuscular or extracorpuscular. In intracorpuscular  disorders, the patientâ€™s red blood cells (RBCs) have an  abnormally short life span because of an intrinsic RBC  factor. In extracorpuscular disorders, the RBC has a  short life span because of a nonintrinsic RBC factor.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an  acquired disorder in which red blood cell and platelet  destruction occur not because of defects of these cell  lines but rather as a result of microangiopathy leading  to destructive shear forces on the cells. Other clinical  signs and symptoms include fever; mental status change;  and, less commonly, renal impairment. Most acquired  adult cases of TTP are associated with autoantibodies to  ADAMTS-13 (or von Willebrand factorâ€“cleaving pro- tease). All cases of hemolysis in conjunction with throm- bocytopenia should be rapidly ruled out for TTP by  evaluation of a peripheral smear for schistocytes because  plasmapheresis is lifesaving. Other causes of extravascular  hemolytic anemia include hypersplenism, autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagula- tion, and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.  The other four disorders listed in the question all refer  to some defect of the RBC itself that leads to hemo- lysis. Elliptocytosis is a membranopathy that leads to   varying degrees of destruction of the RBC in the reticu- loendothelial system. Sickle cell anemia is a congenital  hemoglobinopathy classified by recurrent pain crises and  numerous long-term sequelae that is caused by a well- defined Î²-globin mutation. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is a rare disorder of the glycolytic pathway that causes  hemolytic anemia. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin- uria (PNH) is a form of acquired hemolysis caused by an  intrinsic abnormality of the RBCs. It also often causes  thrombosis and cytopenias. Bone marrow failure is a  feared association with PNH.",A. Elliptocytosis,B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
25,"A 34-year-old woman with a medical history of sickle  cell anemia presents with a 5-day history of fatigue,  lethargy, and shortness of breath. She denies chest  pain and bone pain. She has had no recent travel. Of  note, the patientâ€™s 4-year-old daughter had a â€œcoldâ€_x009d_  2 weeks before the presentation. On examination,  the woman has pale conjunctiva, is anicteric, and is  mildly tachycardic. Abdominal examination is unre- markable. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of  3 g/dL; her baseline is 8 g/dL. The white blood cell  count and platelets are normal. Reticulocyte count  is undetectable. Total bilirubin is 1.4 mg/dL. Lactic  dehydrogenase is at the upper limits of the normal  range. Peripheral blood smear shows a few sickled  cells but a total absence of reticulocytes. The patient  is given a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood  cells and admitted to the hospital. A bone marrow  biopsy shows a normal myeloid series but an absence  of erythroid precursors. Cytogenetics are normal.  What is the most appropriate next management step? A. Make arrangements for exchange transfusion. B. Tissue type her siblings for a possible bone marrow  transplant. C. Check parvovirus titers. D. Start prednisone and cyclosporine. E. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 11) Pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA) is a con- dition characterized by the absence of reticulocytes and  erythroid precursors. A variety of conditions may cause  PRCA. It may be idiopathic. It may be associated with  certain medications, such as trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethox- azole (TMP-SMX) and phenytoin. It can be associated  with a variety of neoplasms, either as a precursor to a  hematologic malignancy such as leukemia or myelo- dysplasia or as part of an autoimmune phenomenon,   Review and Self-Assessment 759 as in the case of thymoma. Infections also may cause  PRCA. Parvovirus B19 is a single-strand DNA virus that  is associated with erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease  in children. It is also associated with arthropathy and a  flulike illness in adults. It is thought to attack the P anti- gen on proerythroblasts directly. Patients with a chronic  hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell disease, or with an  immunodeficiency are less able to tolerate a transient  drop in reticulocytes because their red blood cells do not  survive in the peripheral blood for an adequate period.  In this patient, her daughter had an illness before the  appearance of her symptoms. It is reasonable to check  her parvovirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers. If the  results are positive, a dose of intravenous Ig is indicated.  Because her laboratory test results and smear are not  suggestive of dramatic sickling, an exchange transfusion  is not indicated. Immunosuppression with prednisone,  cyclosporine, or both may be indicated if another etiol- ogy of the PRCA is identified. However, that would  not be the next step. Similarly, a bone marrow trans- plant might be a consideration in a young patient with  myelodysplasia or leukemia, but there is no evidence of  that at this time. Antibiotics have no role in light of her  normal white blood cell count and the lack of evidence  for a bacterial infection.","D. Start prednisone and cyclosporine.

This patient is presenting with a severe hemolytic crisis in the setting of sickle cell anemia. The absence of reticulocytes on peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy suggests a bone marrow suppression crisis, likely due to parvovirus B19 infection. Treatment with prednisone and cyclosporine can help to suppress the immune response and allow for recovery of the bone marrow. Exchange transfusion is not indicated in this case, as the patient has already received a transfusion of packed red blood cells. Tissue typing for a bone marrow transplant would not be appropriate at this time. Broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be indicated unless there is evidence of infection.",The most appropriate next management step would be D. Start prednisone and cyclosporine.
26,Aplastic anemia has been associated with all of the  following EXCEPT: A. Carbamazepine therapy B. Methimazole therapy C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Seronegative hepatitis,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) Aplastic anemia is defined as pancytopenia  with bone marrow hypocellularity. Aplastic anemia  may be acquired, iatrogenic (chemotherapy), or genetic  (e.g., Fanconiâ€™s anemia). Acquired aplastic anemia may  be caused by drugs or chemicals (expected toxicity or  idiosyncratic effects), viral infections, immune diseases,   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, pregnancy, or  idiopathic causes. Aplastic anemia from idiosyncratic  drug reactions (including those listed as well others,  including as quinacrine, phenytoin, sulfonamides, or  cimetidine) are uncommon but may be encountered  given the wide usage of some of these agents. In these  cases, there is usually not a dose-dependent response;  the reaction is idiosyncratic. Seronegative hepatitis is a  cause of aplastic anemia, particularly in young men who  recovered from an episode of liver inflammation 1 to  2 months earlier. Parvovirus B19 infection most com- monly causes pure red blood cell (RBC) aplasia, particu- larly in patients with chronic hemolytic states and high  RBC turnover (e.g., sickle cell anemia).","E.

A blood count reveals  an absolute neutrophil count of 780/Î¼L, hemato- crit of 18%, and platelet count of 21,000/Î¼L. Bone  marrow biopsy reveals hypocellularity with a fatty  marrow. Chromosome studies of peripheral blood  and bone marrow cells are performed that exclude  Fanconiâ€™s anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.  The patient has a fully histocompatible brother.  Which of the following is the best therapy? A. Antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine B. Glucocorticoids C. Growth factors D. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant E. Red blood cell and platelet transfusion","The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) This patient has aplastic anemia. In the absence  of drugs or toxins that cause bone marrow suppression,  it is most likely that he has an immune-mediated injury.  Growth factors are not effective in the setting of hypoplas- tic bone marrow. Transfusion should be avoided unless  emergently needed to prevent the development of allo- antibodies. Glucocorticoids have no efficacy in aplastic  anemia. Immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin  and cyclosporine is a therapy with proven efficacy for this  autoimmune disease with a response rate of up to 70%.  Relapses are common, and myelodysplastic syndrome  or leukemia may occur in approximately 15% of treated  patients. Immunosuppression is the treatment of choice  for patients without suitable bone marrow transplant  donors. Bone marrow transplantation is the best current  therapy for young patients with matched sibling donors.  Allogeneic bone marrow transplants from matched sib- lings result in long-term survival in more than 80% of  patients, with better results in children than adults. The  effectiveness of androgens has not been verified in con- trolled trials, but occasional patients will respond or even  demonstrate blood count dependence on continued ther- apy. Sex hormones upregulate telomerase gene activity in  vitro, possibly also their mechanism of action in improv- ing marrow function. For patients with moderate disease  or those with severe pancytopenia in whom immunosup- pression has failed, a 3 to 4-month trial is appropriate.","D. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Given the patient's severe pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, the best therapy would be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This would provide the patient with healthy stem cells to restore normal blood cell production. Since the patient has a fully histocompatible brother, this would be an ideal option for treatment.",D.

(Chap. 11) Myelodysplasia, or the MDSs, are a hetero- geneous group of hematologic disorders broadly charac- terized by cytopenias associated with a dysmorphic (or  abnormal appearing) and usually cellular bone marrow  and by consequent ineffective blood cell production.  The mean onset of age is after 70 years. MDS is associ- ated with environmental exposures such as radiation and  benzene; other risk factors have been reported inconsis- tently. Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of can- cer treatment, usually with a combination of radiation  and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as busul- fan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period  of 5â€“7 years) or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors   (2 years). Both acquired aplastic anemia after immuno- suppressive treatment and Fanconiâ€™s anemia can evolve  into MDS. MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell dis- order leading to impaired cell proliferation and differen- tiation. Cytogenetic abnormalities are found in approxi- mately half of patients, and some of the same specific  lesions are also seen in frank leukemia. Anemia dominates  the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain  of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea,  and pallor, but at least half of patients are asymptomatic,  and their MDS is discovered only incidentally on routine  blood counts. Previous chemotherapy or radiation expo- sure is an important historic fact. Fever and weight loss  should point to a myeloproliferative rather than myelo- dysplastic process. About 20% of patients have spleno- megaly. Bone marrow is typically hypercellular. Median  survival varies from months to years, depending on the  number of blasts in marrow and the specific cytogenetic  abnormality. Isolated 5q- is associated with a median  survival in years. Most patients die as a result of com- plications of pancytopenia and not because of leukemic    Review and Self-Assessment 760 transformation; perhaps one-third succumb to other dis- eases unrelated to their MDS. Precipitous worsening of  pancytopenia, acquisition of new chromosomal abnor- malities on serial cytogenetic determination, increase in  the number of blasts, and marrow fibrosis are all poor  prognostic indicators. The outlook in therapy-related  MDS, regardless of type, is extremely poor, and most  patients progress within a few months to refractory acute  myeloid leukemia. Historically, the therapy of MDS has  been unsatisfactory. Only stem cell transplantation offers  cure. Survival rates of 50% at 3 years have been reported,  but older patients are particularly prone to develop treat- ment-related mortality and morbidity. Results of trans- plant using matched unrelated donors are comparable,  although most series contain younger and more highly  selected cases. However, multiple new drugs have been  approved for use in MDS. Several regimens appear to  not only improve blood counts but also to delay onset of  leukemia and to improve survival.  Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative with a more  favorable toxicity profile, is particularly effective in  reversing anemia in MDS patients with 5q- syndrome;  a high proportion of these patients become transfusion  independent.","B. He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation.

This statement is not true. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with the 5q-cytogenetic abnormality have a relatively good prognosis compared to other subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome. Leukemic transformation is less common in these patients compared to other subtypes.",D. Lenalidomide is effective in reversing the anemia.
29,All of the following are considered myeloprolif- erative disorders in the WHO classification system  EXCEPT: A. Chronic myeloid leukemia (bcr-abl positive) B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Mastocytosis D. Polycythemia vera E. Primary effusion lymphoma  Review and Self-Assessment 731,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) The World Health Organizationâ€™s classifica- tion of the chronic myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs)  includes eight disorders, some of which are rare or  poorly characterized but all of which share an origin in a  multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell, overproduc- tion of one or more of the formed elements of the blood  without significant dysplasia, a predilection to extramed- ullary hematopoiesis or myelofibrosis, and transforma- tion at varying rates to acute leukemia. Within this broad  classification, however, significant phenotypic hetero- geneity exists. Some diseases such as chronic myeloid  leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL),  and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) express pri- marily a myeloid phenotype, but in others, such as poly- cythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and  essential thrombocytosis (ET), erythroid or megakaryo- cytic hyperplasia predominates. The latter three disor- ders, in contrast to the former three, also appear capable  of transforming into each other. Such phenotypic het- erogeneity has a genetic basis. CML is the consequence  of the balanced translocation between chromosomes   9 and 22 (t[9;22][q34;11]), CNL has been associated with  a t(15;19) translocation, and CEL occurs with a deletion  or balanced translocations involving the PDGFR-alpha  gene. By contrast, to a greater or lesser extent, PV, PMF,  and ET are characterized by expression of a JAK2 muta- tion, V617F, that causes constitutive activation of this  tyrosine kinase that is essential for the function of the  erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors but not  the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. This  essential distinction is also reflected in the natural history  of CML, CNL, and CEL, which is usually measured in  years, and their high rate of transformation into acute  leukemia. By contrast, the natural history of PV, PMF,  and ET is usually measured in decades, and transforma- tion to acute leukemia is uncommon in the absence of  exposure to mutagenic agents. Primary effusion lym- phoma is not a myeloproliferative disease. It is one of  the diseases (Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, multicentric Castlemanâ€™s  disease) associated with infection with human herpes  virus-8, particularly in immunocompromised hosts.","E. Primary effusion lymphoma

30,Which of the following statements regarding poly- cythemia vera is correct? A. An elevated plasma erythropoietin level excludes the  diagnosis. B. Transformation to acute leukemia is common. C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic  risk. D. Aspirin should be prescribed to all of these patients  to reduce thrombotic risk. E. Phlebotomy is used only after hydroxyurea and  interferon have been tried.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 13) Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal disorder  that involves a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor  cell. Clinically, it is characterized by a proliferation of  red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes, and platelets. The  precise etiology is unknown. Unlike chronic myeloid  leukemia, no consistent cytogenetic abnormality has  been associated with the disorder. However, a muta- tion in the autoinhibitory, pseudokinase domain of the  tyrosine kinase JAK2â€”that replaces valine with phenyl- alanine (V617F), causing constitutive activation of the  kinaseâ€”appears to have a central role in the pathogen- esis of PV. Erythropoiesis is regulated by the hormone  erythropoietin. Hypoxia is the physiologic stimulus that  increases the number of cells that produce erythropoi- etin. Erythropoietin may be elevated in patients with  hormone-secreting tumors. Levels are usually â€œnormalâ€_x009d_  in patients with hypoxic erythrocytosis. In PV, how- ever, because erythrocytosis occurs independently of  erythropoietin, levels of the hormone are usually low.  Therefore, an elevated level is not consistent with the  diagnosis. PV is a chronic, indolent disease with a low  rate of transformation to acute leukemia, especially in  the absence of treatment with radiation or hydroxy- urea. Thrombotic complications are the main risk for  PV and correlate with the erythrocytosis. Thrombocy- tosis, although sometimes prominent, does not correlate  with the risk of thrombotic complications. Salicylates are  useful in treating erythromelalgia but are not indicated  in asymptomatic patients. There is no evidence that  thrombotic risk is significantly lowered with their use in  patients whose hematocrits are appropriately controlled  with phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treat- ment. Induction of a state of iron deficiency is critical to  prevent a reexpansion of the RBC mass. Chemothera- peutics and other agents are useful in cases of symptom- atic splenomegaly. Their use is limited by side effects,  and there is a risk of leukemogenesis with hydroxyurea.",C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic risk.,C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic risk.
31,"A 68-year-old man seeks evaluation for fatigue, weight  loss, and early satiety that have been present for about 4  months. On physical examination, his spleen is noted  to be markedly enlarged. It is firm to touch and crosses  the midline. The lower edge of the spleen reaches to  the pelvis. His hemoglobin is 11.1 g/dL and hema- tocrit is 33.7%. The leukocyte count is 6200/Î¼L and  platelet count is 220,000/Î¼L. The white cell count  differential is 75% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 8%  myelocytes, 4% metamyelocytes, 8% lymphocytes,  3% monocytes, and 2% eosinophils. The peripheral  blood smear shows teardrop cells, nucleated red blood  cells, and immature granulocytes. Rheumatoid factor  is positive. A bone marrow biopsy is attempted, but  no cells are able to be aspirated. No evidence of leu- kemia or lymphoma is found. What is the most likely  cause of the splenomegaly? A. Chronic primary myelofibrosis B. Chronic myeloid leukemia C. Rheumatoid arthritis D. Systemic lupus erythematosus E. Tuberculosis","The answer is A.  (Chap. 13) Chronic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is the  least common myeloproliferative disorder and is considered   Review and Self-Assessment 761 a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of myelofi- brosis have been ruled out. The typical patient with PMF  presents in the sixth decade of life, and the disorder is  asymptomatic in many patients. Fevers, fatigue, night  sweats, and weight loss may occur in PMF, but these  symptoms are rare in other myeloproliferative disorders.  However, no signs or symptoms are specific for the diag- nosis of PMF. Often marked splenomegaly is present and  may extend across the midline and to the pelvic brim. A  peripheral blood smear demonstrates the typical findings  of myelofibrosis, including teardrop-shaped red blood  cells (RBCs), nucleated RBCs, myelocytes, and metamy- elocytes that are indicative of extramedullary hematopoi- esis. Anemia is usually mild, and platelet and leukocyte  counts are often normal. About 50% of patients with  PMF have the JAK2 V617F mutation. Bone marrow  aspirate is frequently unsuccessful because the extent  of marrow fibrosis makes aspiration impossible. When  a bone marrow biopsy is performed, it demonstrates  hypercellular marrow with trilineage hyperplasia and  increased number of megakaryocytes with large dysplas- tic nuclei. Interestingly, individuals with PMF often have  associated autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor,  antinuclear antibodies, or positive Coombs test results.  To diagnose someone as having PMF, it must be shown  that he or she does not have another myeloproliferative  disorder or hematologic malignancy that is the cause of  myelofibrosis. The most common disorders that present  in a similar fashion to PMF are polycythemia vera and  chronic myeloid leukemia. Other nonmalignant disor- ders that can cause myelofibrosis include HIV infection,  hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, systemic  lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, and bone marrow  replacement in other cancers such as prostate and breast  cancer. In the patient described here, there is no other  identifiable cause of myelofibrosis; thus, chronic PMF  can be diagnosed.","A. Chronic primary myelofibrosis

The presence of teardrop cells, nucleated red blood cells, and immature granulocytes on the peripheral blood smear, along with an enlarged spleen and inability to aspirate bone marrow cells, are all consistent with chronic primary myelofibrosis. This condition is characterized by abnormal production of blood cells in the bone marrow, leading to fibrosis and enlargement of the spleen. Other symptoms can include fatigue, weight loss, and early satiety. The positive rheumatoid factor may be a secondary finding in this case.",A. Chronic primary myelofibrosis

Iron-deficiency anemia B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Chronic myeloid leukemia D. Myelodysplasia E. Pernicious anemia","The answer is E. (Chap. 13) Thrombocytosis may be â€œprimaryâ€_x009d_ or â€œsec- ondary.â€_x009d_ Essential thrombocytosis is a myeloproliferative  disorder that involves a multipotent hematopoietic pro- genitor cell. Unfortunately, no clonal marker can  reliably  distinguish it from more common nonclonal, reactive  forms of thrombocytosis. Only 50% of patients with  essential (primary) thrombocytosis have the JAK2 V617F  mutation. Therefore, the diagnosis is one of exclusion.  Common causes of secondary thrombocytosis include  infection, inflammatory conditions, malignancy, iron  deficiency, hemorrhage, and postsurgical states. Other  myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myeloid  leukemia and myelofibrosis, may result in thrombocy- tosis. Similarly, myelodysplastic syndromes, particularly  the 5q-syndrome, may cause thrombocytosis. Perni- cious anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency does not  typically cause thrombocytosis. However, correc- tion of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency may  cause a â€œreboundâ€_x009d_ thrombocytosis. Similarly, cessa- tion of chronic ethanol use may also cause rebound   thrombocytosis.","E. Pernicious anemia

33,"A 38-year-old woman is referred for evaluation  of an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit that  was discovered during an evaluation of recurrent  headaches. Until about 8 months previously, she  was in good health, but she developed increasingly     persistent headaches with intermittent vertigo and   tinnitus. She was originally prescribed sumatriptan  for presumed migraine headaches but did not expe- rience relief of her symptoms. A CT scan of the  brain showed no evidence of mass lesion.  During  evaluation of her headaches, she was found to have a  hemoglobin of 17.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 52%.  Her only other symptom is diffuse itching after hot  showers. She is a nonsmoker. She has no history  pulmonary or cardiac disease. On physical examina- tion, she appears well. Her body mass index is 22.3  kg/m2. Vital signs are blood pressure of 148/84 mm  Hg, heart rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of  12 breaths/min, and SaO2 of 99% on room air. She  is afebrile. The physical examination, including full  neurologic examination, is normal. There are no  heart murmurs. There is no splenomegaly. Periph- eral pulses are normal. Laboratory studies confirm  elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. She also has  a platelet count of 650,000/Î¼L. Leukocyte count  is 12,600/Î¼L with a normal differential. Which of  the following tests should be performed next in the  evaluation of this patient? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Erythropoietin level C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation D. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase E. Red blood cell mass and plasma volume determination","The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) In a patient presenting with an elevated  hemoglobin and hematocrit, the initial step in the evalu- ation is to determine whether erythrocytosis represents a  true elevation in red blood cell (RBC) mass or whether  spurious erythrocytosis is present because of plasma vol- ume contraction. (See Figure 35.) This step may be not  necessary, however, in individuals with hemoglobin >20  g/dL. After absolute erythrocytosis has been determined  by measurement of RBC mass and plasma volume, the  cause of erythrocytosis must be determined. If there is  not an obvious cause of the erythrocytosis, an erythro- poietin level should be checked. An elevated erythropoi- etin level suggests hypoxia or autonomous production of  erythropoietin as the cause of erythrocytosis. However,  a normal erythropoietin level does not exclude hypoxia  as a cause. A low erythropoietin level should be seen in  the myeloproliferative disorder polycythemia vera (PV),  the most likely cause of erythrocytosis in this patient. PV  is often discovered incidentally when elevated hemo- globin is found during testing for other reasons. When  symptoms are present, the most common complaints are  related to hyperviscosity of the blood and include ver- tigo, headache, tinnitus, and transient ischemic attacks.  Patients may also complain of pruritus after showering.  Erythromelalgia is the term give to the symptom complex  of burning, pain, and erythema in the extremities and is  associated with thrombocytosis in PV. Isolated systolic  hypertension and splenomegaly may be found. In addi- tion to elevated red RBC mass and low erythropoietin  levels, other laboratory findings in PV include throm- bocytosis and leukocytosis with abnormal leukocytes  present. Uric acid levels and leukocyte alkaline phos- phatase may be elevated but are not diagnostic for PV.  Approximately 30% of individuals with PV are homo- zygous for the JAK2 V617F mutation, and >90% are  heterozygous for this mutation. This mutation located  on the short arm of chromosome 9 causes constitutive  activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) protein, a tyrosine  kinase that renders erythrocytes resistant to apoptosis  and allows them to continue production independently  from erythropoietin. However, not every patient with  PV expresses this mutation, and approximately 50% of  patients with chronic myelofibrosis and essential throm- bocytosis express this mutation. Thus, it is not recom- mended as an initial diagnostic test for PV but may be  used for confirmatory purposes. Bone marrow biopsy  provides no specific information in PV and is not rec- ommended.  Review and Self-Assessment 762","C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation

This patient's presentation is concerning for polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by elevated red blood cell mass. The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera, making genetic testing for this mutation an important next step in the evaluation of this patient. Bone marrow biopsy may also be considered to confirm the diagnosis, but genetic testing for the JAK2 V617F mutation is a less invasive and more specific test for polycythemia vera. Erythropoietin levels may be low in polycythemia vera, but this test is not specific for the diagnosis. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is not typically elevated in polycythemia vera. Red blood cell mass and plasma volume determination may also be considered, but genetic testing for the JAK2 V617F mutation is a more specific test for polycythemia vera.",C.

Trisomy 12  Review and Self-Assessment 732","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) This patient presents with typical findings of  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which has an inci- dence of 1.5 per 100,000 people yearly. The typical age  of onset is in the mid forties, and there is a slight male  predominance. Half of individuals are asymptomatic at  the time of diagnosis. If symptoms are present, they are  typically nonspecific and include fatigue and weight loss.  Occasionally, patients have symptoms related to splenic  enlargement such as early satiety and left upper quad- rant pain. Laboratory findings are suggestive of CML.  A high leukocyte count of 100,000/Î¼L is typical, with  a predominant granulocytic differential, including neu- trophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and band forms.  The circulating blast count should be <5%. Anemia and  thrombocytosis are also common. The bone marrow  demonstrates nonspecific increase in cellularity with an  increase in the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio. The diagnosis  of CML is established by identifying a clonal expansion  of a hematopoietic stem cell possessing a reciprocal trans- location between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translo- cation results in the head-to-tail fusion of the breakpoint  cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11 with  the ABL1 (named after the Abelson murine leukemia  virus) gene located on chromosome 9q34. The bcr-abl  fusion protein results in constitutive activation of abl  tyrosine kinase enzyme that prevents apoptosis and leads  to increased survival of the cells containing the muta- tion.

C. Men have a higher incidence of acute myeloid leu- kemia than women. D. The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia is greatest  in individuals younger than 20 years of age. E. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is associated with an  increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia.","The answer is D.  (Chap. 14) The acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are a  group of hematologic malignancies derived from hema- tologic stem cells that have acquired chromosomal muta- tions that prevent differentiation into mature myeloid  cells. The specific chromosomal abnormalities predict  in which stage of differentiation the cell is arrested and  are associated with the several subtypes of AML that  have been identified. In the United States, >16,000  new cases of AML are diagnosed yearly, and the num- bers of new cases of AML has increased in the past   10 years. Men are diagnosed with AML more frequently  than women (4.6 cases per 100,000 population vs 3.0  cases per 100,000, respectively). In addition, older age  is associated with increased incidence of AML, with an  incidence of 18.6 cases per 100,000 population in those  older than 65 years of age. AML is uncommon in adoles- cents. Other known risk factors for the development of  AML include hereditary genetic abnormalities, radiation  and chemical exposures, and drugs. The most common  hereditary abnormality linked to AML is trisomy 21  (Down syndrome). Other hereditary syndromes associ- ated with an increase of AML include diseases associated  with defective DNA repair such as Fanconiâ€™s anemia  and ataxia telangiectasia. Survivors of the atomic bomb  explosions in Japan were found to have a high incidence  of AML as have survivors of other high-dose radiation  exposures. However, therapeutic radiation is not associ- ated with an increased risk of AML unless the patient  was also treated concomitantly with alkylating agents.  Anticancer drugs are the most common causes of drug- associated AML.

She has no  siblings. What is the best initial therapy for this   patient? A. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant B. Autologous stem cell transplant C. Imatinib mesylate D. Interferon-Î± E. Leukapheresis","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) The goal of therapy in chronic myeloid leu- kemia (CML) is to achieve prolonged, durable, non- neoplastic, nonclonal hematopoiesis, which entails the  eradication of any residual cells containing the BCR- ABL1 transcript. Hence, the goal is complete molecular  remission and cure. Therapy of CML has changed in  recent years because of the presence of a proven curative   Review and Self-Assessment 763 treatment (allogeneic transplantation) that has significant  toxicity and a targeted treatment (imatinib) with out- standing outcome based on 8-year follow-up data. New  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are becoming available, mak- ing this a dynamic topic. Many experts currently recom- mend initiating therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and reserving allogeneic transplantation for those who  develop drug resistance. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine  kinase inhibitor that acts to decrease the activity of the  bcr-abl fusion protein that results from the recipro- cal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadel- phia chromosome). It acts as a competitive inhibitor of  the abl kinase at its ATP binding site and thus leads to  inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in  bcr-abl signal transduction. In newly diagnosed CML,  imatinib results in a complete hematologic remission in  95% of patients initially and 76% at 18 months. Low- risk patients have a higher durable remission rate. All  imatinib-treated patients who achieved major molecular  remission (26%), defined as 3 log or greater reduction  in BCR-ABL1 transcript level at 18 months compared  with pretreatment level, were progression free at 5 years.  There is a consensus that molecular responses can be  used as a treatment goal in CML. Imatinib, taken orally,  has limited side effects that include nausea, fluid reten- tion, diarrhea, and skin rash and is usually well tolerated.  Interferon-Î± was previously the first-line chemotherapy  if bone marrow transplant was not an option, but it has  been replaced by imatinib mesylate. Autologous stem cell  transplant is not currently used for treatment of CML  because there is no reliable way to select residual normal  hematopoietic progenitor cells. Leukopheresis is used for  control of leukocyte counts when the patient is experi- encing complications such as respiratory failure or cere- bral ischemia related to the high white blood cell count.","C. Imatinib mesylate

Imatinib mesylate is the first-line therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia, particularly for patients who are asymptomatic with high leukocyte counts. It is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the abnormal BCR-ABL fusion protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant may be considered in younger patients with high-risk disease, but it is not typically the first-line therapy. Autologous stem cell transplant is not typically used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Interferon-α may be used in certain cases, but imatinib is generally preferred due to its higher efficacy and better tolerability. Leukapheresis may be used as a temporary measure to reduce leukocyte counts in patients with symptomatic leukostasis, but it is not a long-term treatment option.",C. Imatinib mesylate

Laboratory examination reveals the following:  hemoglobin, 5.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 15%; platelets,  12,000/Î¼L; and white blood cell (WBC) count,  168,000/Î¼L with 45% blast forms, 30% neutrophils,  20% lymphocytes, and 5% monocytes. Review of  the peripheral blood smear confirms acute myeloid  leukemia (M1 subtype, myeloblastic leukemia with- out maturation) with complex chromosomal abnor- malities on cytogenetics. All of the following confer  a poor prognosis for this patient EXCEPT: A. Advanced age B. Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics  Review and Self-Assessment 733 C. Hemoglobin below 7 g/dL D. Prolonged interval between symptom onset and  diagnosis E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) Patients with acute leukemia frequently pres- ent with nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and weight  loss. In addition, weight loss and anorexia are also com- mon. About half have had symptoms for >3 months at  the time of presentation. Fever is present in only about  10% of patients at presentation, and 5% have evidence of  abnormal hemostasis. On physical examination, hepato- megaly, splenomegaly, sternal tenderness, and evidence  of infection or hemorrhage are common presenting signs.  Laboratory studies are confirmatory with evidence of  anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis often pres- ent. The median presenting leukocyte count at presenta- tion is 15,000/Î¼L. About 20â€“40% have presenting leu- kocyte counts <5000/Î¼L, and another 20% have counts  >100,000/Î¼L. Review of the peripheral smear confirms  leukemia in most cases. If Auer rods are seen, the diagno- sis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is virtually certain.  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/Î¼L) is seen  in >75% of individuals with AML. After the diagnosis  of AML has been confirmed, rapid evaluation and treat- ment should be undertaken. The general health of the  cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems  should be evaluated because chemotherapy has adverse  effects that may cause organ dysfunction in any of these  systems. Overall, chromosome findings at diagnosis are  currently the most important independent prognostic   factor. Patients with t(15;17) have a very good prognosis    Review and Self-Assessment 764 (~85% cured), and those with t(8;21) and inv(16) have a  good prognosis (~55% cured), but those with no cytoge- netic abnormality have a moderately favorable outcome  (~40% cured). Patients with a complex karyotype, t(6;9),  inv(3), or â€“7, have a very poor prognosis. Among the  prognostic factors that predict poor outcomes in AML,  age at diagnosis is one of the most important because indi- viduals of advanced age tolerate induction chemotherapy  poorly. In addition, advanced age is more likely to be  associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities that  predict poorer response to chemotherapy, although some  chromosomal markers predict a better response to che- motherapy. Poor performance status independent of age  also decreases survival in AML. Responsiveness to chemo- therapy and survival are also worse if the leukocyte count  is >100,000/Î¼L or the antecedent course of symptoms  is prolonged. Anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytope- nia present for >3 months is a poor prognostic indicator.  However, there is no absolute degree of anemia or throm- bocytopenia that predicts worse outcomes.","B. Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics

Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The other factors listed, such as advanced age, low hemoglobin levels, and a prolonged interval between symptom onset and diagnosis, are all associated with a poor prognosis in this patient. A high WBC count above 100,000/μL is also associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.","The poor prognosis factors for the patient with acute myeloid leukemia (M1 subtype) include advanced age, complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics, hemoglobin below 7 g/dL, and a prolonged interval between symptom onset and diagnosis. The factor that does not confer a poor prognosis for this patient is a white blood cell (WBC) count above 100,000/μL."
38,The evaluation in a newly diagnosed case of acute  lymphoid leukemia should routinely include all of  the following EXCEPT: A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Cell-surface phenotyping C. Cytogenetic testing D. Lumbar puncture E. Plasma viscosity,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 15) Viscosity testing is typically reserved for cases  of multiple myeloma in which paraproteins (particularly  immunoglobulin M) can lead to vascular sludging and  subsequent tissue ischemia. Acute lymphoid leukemia  (ALL) can lead to end-organ abnormalities in the kidney  and liver; therefore, routine chemistry tests are indicated.  A lumbar puncture must be performed in cases of newly  diagnosed ALL to rule out spread of disease to the central  nervous system. Bone marrow biopsy reveals the degree  of marrow infiltration and is often necessary for classifica- tion of the tumor. Immunologic cell-surface marker test- ing often identifies the cell lineage involved and the type  of tumor, information that is often impossible to discern  from morphologic interpretation alone. Cytogenetic test- ing provides prognostic information on the disease natu- ral history. In ALL, the prognosis depends on the genetic  characteristics of the tumor, the patientâ€™s age, the white  blood cell count, and the patientâ€™s overall clinical status and  major organ function.","E. Plasma viscosity

Plasma viscosity is not typically included in the routine evaluation of a newly diagnosed case of acute lymphoid leukemia. It is not a standard test used in the diagnosis or monitoring of this type of leukemia.",D. Lumbar puncture
39,All of the following infectious agents have been  associated with development of a lymphoid malig- nancy EXCEPT: A. Helicobacter pylori B. Hepatitis B C. Hepatitis C D. HIV E. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8),"The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Hepatitis B and C are both common causes  of cirrhosis and are strongly associated with the devel- opment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C, but  not hepatitis B, can also lead to a lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma, often in the spleen, that resolves with cure  of hepatitis C. Epstein-Barr virus has been associated  with a large number of lymphoid malignancies, includ- ing posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD),  Hodgkinâ€™s disease, central nervous system lymphoma,  and Burkittâ€™s lymphoma. Helicobacter pylori infection is  necessary and sufficient for gastric mucosa-associated  lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma development, and  cure can be achieved with eradication of the organism in  some cases. HHV8 is a known cause of body cavity lym- phoma, including primary pleural lymphoma. In addi- tion to those listed, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1  is associated with adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia.  Other disorders associated with lymphoma include  celiac sprue, autoimmune disease, and biologic therapies  for autoimmune disease. Celiac sprue has been associated  with gastrointestinal tract lymphoma. Many collagen  vascular diseases (e.g., Sjogrenâ€™s disease) and antiâ€“tumor  necrosis factor therapies have been associated with the  development of lymphoma.",A. Helicobacter pylori,A.

His initial evaluation  should include all of the following EXCEPT: A. AST, ALT, and prothrombin time B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Coombs test D. Peripheral blood smear E. Physical examination","The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and throm- bocytopenia are common, and a peripheral blood smear  and a Coombs test help evaluate their presence. Hyper- splenism is also seen in chronic lymphoid leukemia  (CLL) as the spleen sequesters large numbers of circulat- ing blood cells and enlarges. Hence, a careful left upper  quadrant examination looking for a palpable splenic tip  is the standard of care in this situation. This patient is at  risk of hepatic decompensation as well, given his hepati- tis C that can also cause anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Bone marrow infiltration of tumor cells can lead to cyto- penias in CLL. However, this is in effect a diagnosis of  exclusion. After these three possibilities have been ruled  out, a bone marrow biopsy is a reasonable next step.  This initial evaluation before presuming spread of CLL is  critical for therapy because each possibility requires dif- ferent therapy (glucocorticoids or rituximab for hemoly- sis, hepatology referral for liver failure, and splenectomy  for symptomatic hypersplenism).","B.

A complete blood count is notable  for a white cell count of 88,000 with 99% lympho- cytes. A peripheral smear is shown in Figure 45.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  A. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia B. Acute myelogenous leukemia C. Chronic lymphocytic lymphoma D. Hairy cell leukemia E. Mononucleosis","The answer is C.  (Chap. 15) The peripheral smear shows increased num- bers of small, well-differentiated, normal-appearing  lymphocytes characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leu- kemia, the most common leukemia or lymphoma in  adults. Common presenting complaints typically include  fatigue, frequent infections, new lymphadenopathy, and  abdominal complaints relating to splenomegaly. Hairy  cell leukemia is a rare disease that presents predominantly  in older men. The typical presentation involves pancyto- penia, although occasional patients will have a leukemic  presentation. Splenomegaly is usual. The malignant cells  appear to have â€œhairyâ€_x009d_ projections on light and elec- tron microscopy. Patients with this disorder are prone to  unusual infections, including infection by Mycobacterium  avium intracellulare, and to vasculitic syndromes. Hairy cell  leukemia is responsive to chemotherapy with cladrib- ine with clinical complete remissions in the majority of  patients and frequent long-term disease-free survival.","C.

Nodular sclerosing Hodgkinâ€™s disease,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 15) Classical Hodgkinâ€™s disease carries a better  prognosis than all types of non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma.   Review and Self-Assessment 765 Patients with good prognostic factors can achieve cure  with extended field radiation alone, but those with a  higher risk disease often achieve cure with high-dose  chemotherapy and sometimes radiation. The chance  of cure is so high (>90%) that many protocols are now  considering long-term sequelae of current therapy such  as carcinomas, hypothyroidism, premature coronary dis- ease, and constrictive pericarditis in those receiving radi- ation therapy.

He has never been tested for HIV. A lymph node  biopsy is performed and is shown in Figure 47.  Which of the following is the most likely  diagnosis?  FIGURE 45 FIGURE 47  Review and Self-Assessment 734 A. Burkittâ€™s lymphoma B. Cat scratch disease C. CMV infection D. Hodgkinâ€™s disease E. Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma","The answer is D.  (Chap. 15) The large cell with a bilobed nucleus and  prominent nucleoli giving an â€œowlâ€™s eyesâ€_x009d_ appearance  near the center of the field is a Reed-Sternberg cell, con- firming the diagnosis of Hodgkinâ€™s disease. Hodgkinâ€™s  disease occurs in 8000 patients in the United States  each year, and the disease does not appear to be increas- ing in frequency. Most patients present with palpable  lymphadenopathy that is nontender; in most patients,  these lymph nodes are in the neck, supraclavicular area,  and axilla. More than half the patients have mediasti- nal adenopathy at diagnosis, and this is sometimes the  initial manifestation. A subdiaphragmatic presentation of  Hodgkinâ€™s disease is unusual and more common in older  men. One-third of patients present with fevers, night  sweats, or weight loss, which are B symptoms in the  Ann Arbor staging classification. Occasionally, Hodg- kinâ€™s disease can present as a fever of unknown origin.  This is more common in older patients who are found to  have mixed cellularity Hodgkinâ€™s disease in an abdomi- nal site. Rarely, the fevers persist for days to weeks fol- lowed by afebrile intervals and then recurrence of the  fever (Pel-Ebstein fever).

44,All of the following statements regarding mastocy- tosis are true EXCEPT: A. Elevated serum tryptase suggests aggressive   disease. B. Eosinophilia is common. C. It is often associated with myeloid neoplasm. D. More than 90% of cases are confined to the skin. E. Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common clinical  manifestation.,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 16) Mastocytosis is a proliferation and accumula- tion of mast cells in one or more organ systems. Only  the skin is involved in approximately 80% of cases with  the other 20% being defined as systemic mastocytosis  caused by the involvement of another organ system. The  most common manifestation of mastocytosis is cutaneous  urticaria pigmentosa, a maculopapular pigmented rash  involving the papillary dermis. Other cutaneous forms  include diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (almost entirely  in children) and mastocytoma. Clinical manifestations of  systemic mastocytosis are related to either cellular infil- tration of organs or release of histamine, proteases, eico- sanoids, or heparin from mast cells. Therefore, signs and  symptoms may include constitutional symptoms, skin  manifestations (pruritus, dermatographia, rash), medi- ator-related symptoms (abdominal pain, flushing, syn- cope, hypertension, diarrhea), and bone-related symp- toms (fracture, pain, arthralgia). In a recent series, 40%  of patients with systemic mastocytosis had an associated  myeloid neoplasm, most commonly myeloproliferative  syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplas- tic syndrome. Eosinophilia was present in approximately  one-third of patients. Elevated serum tryptase, bone mar- row involvement, splenomegaly, skeletal involvement,  cytopenia, and malabsorption predict more aggressive  disease and a worse prognosis. Many patients with sys- temic mastocytosis have an activating mutation of c-Kit,  a kinase inhibited by imatinib; however, the mutation  appears relatively resistant to this agent.","B. Eosinophilia is common. 

Eosinophilia is not a common finding in mastocytosis.",E. Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common clinical manifestation.
45,"A 58-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency  department for sudden onset cough with yellow  sputum production and dyspnea. Aside from sys- temic hypertension, he is otherwise healthy. His  only medication is amlodipine. Chest radiograph  shows a right upper lobe alveolar infiltrate, and  laboratory test results are notable for a blood urea  nitrogen of 53 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, cal- cium of 12.3 mg/dL, total protein of 9 g/dL, and  albumin of 3.1 g/dL. Sputum culture grows Strep- tococcus pneumonia. Which of the following tests will  confirm the underlying condition predisposing him  to pneumococcal pneumonia? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and  pelvis with contrast C. HIV antibody D. Sweat chloride testing E. Videoscopic swallow study","The answer is A.  (Chap. 17) The patient presents with pneumococcal  pneumonia and evidence of hypercalcemia, renal fail- ure, and a wide protein gap suggestive of an M pro- tein. These findings are classic for multiple myeloma.  Although the patient appears to be making large quan- tities of immunoglobulins, they are in fact generally  monoclonal, and patients actually have functional hypo- gammaglobulinemia related to both decreased produc- tion and increased destruction of normal antibodies. This  hypogammaglobulinemia predisposes patients to infec- tions, most commonly pneumonia with pneumococcus  or Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative pyelonephritis.  Bone marrow biopsy would confirm the presence of  clonal plasma cells and define the quantity, which will  help define treatment options. A serum protein electro- phoresis would also be indicated to prove the presence  of the M protein suspected by the wide protein gap.  Although HIV may be associated with kidney injury,  both acute and chronic, hypercalcemia would be an  unusual feature. There is no clinical history of aspira- tion, and the location of infiltrate, upper lobe, is unusual  for aspiration. Sweat chloride testing is not indicated  because there is no suspicion for cystic fibrosis. Because  solid organ malignancy is not suspected, computed  tomography of the body is unlikely to be helpful.","C. HIV antibody

Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, especially those with sudden onset and severe symptoms, should be evaluated for underlying conditions that predispose them to infection. HIV infection is a known risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia, as it can impair the immune system's ability to fight off infections. Therefore, testing for HIV antibody would be appropriate in this case to confirm or rule out HIV as an underlying condition.",A. Bone marrow biopsy
46,"A 64-year-old African American man is evaluated in  the hospital for congestive heart failure, renal failure,  and polyneuropathy. Physical examination on admis- sion was notable for these findings and raised waxy  papules in the axilla and inguinal region.

Hema- tocrit was 24%, and white blood cell and platelet  counts were normal. Urinalysis was remarkable for  3+ proteinuria but no cellular casts. Further evalu- ation included an echocardiogram with a thickened  left ventricle and preserved systolic function. Which  of the following tests is most likely to diagnose the  underlying condition? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Electromyogram (EMG) with nerve conduction  studies C. Fat pad biopsy D. Right heart catheterization E. Renal ultrasonography","The answer is A.  (Chap. 18) This patient presents with a multisystem ill- ness involving the heart, kidneys, and peripheral ner- vous system. The physical examination is suggestive of  amyloidosis with classic waxy papules in the folds of his  body. The laboratory test results are remarkable for renal  failure of unclear etiology with significant proteinuria  but no cellular casts. A possible etiology of the renal   failure is suggested by the elevated gamma globulin frac- tion and low hematocrit, bringing to mind a monoclo- nal gammopathy perhaps leading to renal failure through  amyloid AL deposition. This could also account for the   Review and Self-Assessment 766 enlarged heart seen on the echocardiography and the  peripheral neuropathy. The fat pad biopsy is generally  reported to be 60â€“80% sensitive for amyloid; how- ever, it would not allow a diagnosis of this patientâ€™s  likely myeloma. A right heart catheterization probably  would prove that the patient has restrictive cardiomy- opathy secondary to amyloid deposition; however, it too  would not diagnose the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.  Renal ultrasonography, although warranted to rule out  obstructive uropathy, would not be diagnostic. Simi- larly, the electromyographic and nerve conduction stud- ies would not be diagnostic. The bone marrow biopsy is  about 50â€“60% sensitive for amyloid, but it would allow  evaluation of the percent of plasma cells in the bone  marrow and allow the diagnosis of multiple myeloma to  be made. Multiple myeloma is associated with amyloid  AL in approximately 20% of cases. Light chains most  commonly deposit systemically in the heart, kidneys,  liver, and nervous system, causing organ dysfunction. In  these organs, biopsy would show the classic eosinophilic  material that, when exposed to Congo red stain, has a  characteristic apple-green birefringence.","C. Fat pad biopsy

This patient's presentation is consistent with systemic amyloidosis, a condition characterized by the deposition of abnormal protein fibrils in various organs and tissues. The presence of waxy papules in the axilla and inguinal region, along with the renal failure, polyneuropathy, and congestive heart failure, are all suggestive of amyloidosis. A fat pad biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can confirm the presence of amyloid deposits in the tissue, making it the most likely test to diagnose the underlying condition in this patient.",C.

47,"A 75-year-old man is hospitalized for treatment of  a deep-vein thrombosis. He had recently been dis- charged from the hospital about 2 months ago. At  that time, he had been treated for community- acquired pneumonia complicated by acute respira- tory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He  was hospitalized for 21 days at that time and had dis- charged from a rehabilitation 2 weeks ago. On the  day before admission, he developed painful swelling  of his left lower extremity. Lower extremity Doppler  ultrasonography confirmed an occlusive thrombus  of his deep femoral vein. After an initial bolus, he  is started on a continuous infusion of unfractionated  heparin at 1600 U/hr because he has end-stage renal  disease on hemodialysis. His activated partial throm- boplastin time is maintained in the therapeutic range.  On day 5, it is noted that his platelets have fallen from  150,000/Î¼L to 88,000/Î¼L. What is the most appro- priate action at this time? A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and  assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. B. Stop all anticoagulation while awaiting results of  anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. C. Stop heparin infusion and initiate argatroban. D. Stop heparin infusion and initiate enoxaparin. E. Stop heparin infusion and initiate lepirudin.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 19) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is  a clinical diagnosis that must not be missed because life- threatening thrombosis can occur if not treated appro- priately. The cause of HIT is the formation of antibodies  to the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4).  This complex is able to activate platelets, monocytes,  and endothelial cells. Many patients exposed to heparin  will develop antibodies to the heparinâ€“PF4 complex, but  only a few of these will progress to develop thrombocy- topenia or thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT).  The typical patient will develop evidence of HIT 5 to  14 days after exposure to heparin, although it can occur  within 5 days in individuals exposed to heparin within  about the previous 100 days as would be expected in this  patient given his recent hospitalization. The nadir platelet  count is typically >20,000/Î¼L. When HIT is suspected,  one should not delay treatment for laboratory testing  because no currently available test has adequate sensitiv- ity or specificity for the diagnosis. The antiheparin/PF4  antibody test result is positive in many individuals who  have been exposed to heparin regardless of whether HIT  is present. The platelet activation assay is more specific  but less sensitive for HIT. As soon as HIT is suspected,  heparin should be discontinued and replaced with an  alternative form of anticoagulation to protect against  development of new thromboses. Low-molecular-weight  heparins (LMWHs) such as enoxaparin are not appropri- ate treatment options in individuals with HIT. Although   heparin is 10 times more likely to cause HIT, LMWHs  also cause the illness and should not be used. The primary  agents used for HIT in the United States are the direct  thrombin inhibitors argatroban and lepirudin. Argatroban  is the preferred agent for this patient because of his renal  failure. The drug is not excreted by the kidneys, and  no dosage adjustment is required. In contrast, lepirudin  is markedly increased in renal failure, and a significant  dosage adjustment is required. Danaparoid has previ- ously been used frequently for HIT and HITT, but this  medication is no longer available in the United States.  Other anticoagulants that are used for treatment of HITT  include bivalirudin and fondaparinux, but these also are  not currently approved for use in the United States.","A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies.

This patient is experiencing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a rare but serious complication of heparin therapy. The most appropriate action at this time is to continue the heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. If the antibodies are positive, heparin should be stopped immediately and an alternative anticoagulant such as argatroban, enoxaparin, or lepirudin should be initiated.",A.

48,"A 48-year-old woman is evaluated by her primary  care physician for a complaint of gingival bleed- ing and easy bruising. She has noted the problem  for about 2 months. Initially, she attributed it to  aspirin that she was taking intermittently for head- aches, but she stopped all aspirin and nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drug use 6 weeks ago. Her only  medical history is an automobile accident 12 years  previously that caused a liver laceration. It required  surgical repair, and she did receive several transfu- sions of red blood cells and platelets at that time.  She currently takes no prescribed medications and  otherwise feels well. On physical examination, she  appears well and healthy. She has no jaundice or  scleral icterus. Her cardiac and pulmonary exami- nation results are normal.

The spleen tip is not palpable. There are  petechiae present on her extremities and hard pal- ate with a few small ecchymoses on her extremities.  A complete blood count shows a hemoglobin of  12.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 37.6%, white blood cell  count of 8400/Î¼L with a normal differential, and a  platelet count of 7500/Î¼L. What tests are indicated  for the workup of this patientâ€™s thrombocytopenia? A. Antiplatelet antibodies B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Hepatitis C antibody D. Human immunodeficiency antibody E. C and D F. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 19) This patient presents with symptoms of  thrombocytopenia, including bleeding gums and easy  bruising. The only finding on physical examination  may be petechiae at points of increased venous pressure,  especially in the feet and ankles. The laboratory findings  confirm thrombocytopenia but show no abnormalities in  other cell lines. When evaluating isolated thrombocyto- penia, one must initially consider whether an underlying  infection or medication is causing the platelet count to  fall. There is a long list of medications that are implicated  in thrombocytopenia, including aspirin, acetaminophen,  penicillins, H2 blockers, heparin, and many others. This  patient discontinued all medications over 6 weeks pre- viously, and the platelet count would be expected to  recover if a medication reaction were the cause. She  gives no signs of any acute infection. Thus, the most  likely diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenia purpura  (ITP). This disorder is also known as idiopathic throm- bocytopenia purpura and refers to an immune-mediated  destruction of platelets and possible inhibition of plate- let release from megakaryocytes. ITP can truly be idio- pathic, or it can be secondary to an underlying disorder,  including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV, or  chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The platelet  count can be quite low (<5000/Î¼L) in patients with ITP  and usually presents with mucocutaneous bleeding. Lab- oratory testing for ITP should include a peripheral smear  that typically demonstrates large platelets with other- wise normal morphology. Initial testing should evaluate  for secondary causes of ITP, including HIV antibodies,  HCV antibodies, serologic testing for SLE, serum pro- tein electrophoresis, and immunoglobulins. If anemia is  also present, a direct Coombs test is indicated to assess  whether there is a combined autoimmune hemolytic  anemia with ITP (Evans syndrome). Antiplatelet anti- body testing is not recommended because these tests  have low sensitivity and specificity for ITP. In addition,  bone marrow biopsy is typically not performed unless  there are other abnormalities that are not explained by  ITP or the patient has failed to respond to usual therapy.","F. All of the above

Thrombocytopenia can have various causes, so it is important to perform a thorough workup to determine the underlying cause. In this case, the patient's history of a liver laceration and transfusions, as well as the presence of petechiae and ecchymoses, suggest that the thrombocytopenia may be related to a previous event or condition.

Testing for antiplatelet antibodies can help determine if the thrombocytopenia is immune-mediated. A bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to evaluate for any underlying bone marrow disorders or abnormalities. Testing for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies is important to rule out any infectious causes of thrombocytopenia.

Therefore, all of the above tests are indicated for the workup of this patient's thrombocytopenia.",B. Bone marrow biopsy

The hemophilias affect about  1 in 10,000 males worldwide with hemophilia A respon- sible for 80% of cases. Clinically, there is no difference  between hemophilia A and B. The disease presentation  largely depends on the residual activity of factor VIII or  factor IX. Severe disease is typically seen when factor  activity is <1%, and moderate disease appears when the   levels range between 1% and 5%. The clinical manifesta- tion of moderate and severe disease is commonly bleed- ing into the joints, soft tissues, and  muscles that occurs  after  minimal trauma or even spontaneously. When fac- tor activity is >25%, bleeding would occur only after  major trauma or surgery, and the diagnosis may not be  made unless a prolonged activated partial thromboplas- tin time is seen on routine laboratory examination. To  make a definitive diagnosis, one would need to mea- sure specific levels of factor VIII and IX. Without treat- ment, life expectancy is limited, but given the changes in  therapy since the 1980s, the life span is about 65 years.  Early treatment of hemophilia required the use of pooled  plasma that was used to make factor concentrates. Given  the large number of donors required to generate the fac- tor concentrates and the frequent need for transfusion  in some individuals, bloodborne pathogens such as HIV  and hepatitis C are among the leading cause of death in  patients with hemophilia. In the 1990s, recombinant fac- tor VIII and IX were developed. Primary prophylaxis is  given to individuals with baseline factor activity levels of  <1% to prevent spontaneous bleeding, especially hemar- throses. Although this strategy is highly recommended,  only about 50% of eligible patients receive prophylactic  therapy because of the high costs and need for regular  intravenous infusions. When an individual is suspected  of having a bleed, the treatment should begin as soon  as possible and not delayed until factor activity levels  return. Factor concentrates should be given to raise the  activity level to 50% for large hematomas or deep muscle  bleeds, and an individual may require treatment for a  period of 7 days or more. For milder bleeds, including  uncomplicated hemarthrosis, the goal factor activity level  is 30â€“50% with maintenance of levels between 15% and  25% for 2 to 3 days after the initial transfusions. In addi- tion to treatment with factor concentrates, care should  be taken to avoid medications that inhibit platelet func- tion. DDAVP, a desmopressin analogue, can be given as  adjunctive therapy for acute bleeding episodes in hemo- philia A because this may cause a transient rise in factor  VIII levels and von Willebrand factor because of release  from endothelial cells. This medication is typically only  useful in mild to moderate disease. Antifibrinolytic drugs  such as tranexamic acid or Îµ-amino caproic acid are help- ful in promoting hemostasis for mucosal bleeding.",A.

50,"A 24-year-old man is admitted to the hospital  with circulatory collapse in the setting of dissemi- nated meningococcemia. He is currently intu- bated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. He  has received over 6 L of intravenous saline in the  past 6 hours but remains hypotensive, requiring  treatment with norepinephrine and vasopressin at  maximum doses. He is making <20 mL of urine  each hour. Blood is noted to be oozing from all  FIGURE 53  Review and Self-Assessment 736    of IV sites. His endotracheal secretions are blood  tinged. His laboratory studies show a white blood  cell count of 24,300/Î¼L (82% neutrophils, 15%  bands, 3% lymphocytes), hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL,  hematocrit of 26.1%, and platelets of 19,000/Î¼L.  The international normalized ratio is 3.6, the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time is 75 seconds, and  fibrinogen is 42 mg/dL. The lactate dehydrogenase  level is 580 U/L, and the haptoglobin is <10 mg/dL.   The peripheral smear shows thrombocytopenia and  schistocytes. All of the following treatments are  indicated in this patient EXCEPT: A. Ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously twice daily B. Cryoprecipitate C. Fresh-frozen plasma D. Heparin E. Platelets","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  is a consumptive coagulopathy that is characterized by  diffuse intravascular fibrin formation that overcomes the  bodyâ€™s natural anticoagulant mechanisms. DIC is most  commonly associated with sepsis, trauma, or malignancy  or in obstetric complications. The pathogenesis of DIC  is not completely elucidated, but it involves intravascular  exposure to phospholipids from damaged tissue, hemo- lysis, and endothelial damage. This leads to stimulation of  procoagulant pathways with uncontrolled thrombin gen- eration and microvascular ischemia. A secondary hyper- fibrinolysis subsequently occurs. The primary  clinical   Review and Self-Assessment 768 manifestations of DIC are bleeding at venipuncture sites,  petechiae, and ecchymoses. Severe gastrointestinal and  pulmonary hemorrhage can occur. The clinical diagnosis  of DIC is based on laboratory findings in the appropri- ate clinical setting, such as severe sepsis. Although there  is no single test for DIC, the common constellation of  findings is thrombocytopenia (<100,000/Î¼L), elevated  prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplas- tin time, evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mia, and elevated fibrin degradation productions and  d-dimer. The fibrinogen level may be <100 mg/dL but  often does not decrease acutely unless the DIC is very  severe. The primary treatment of DIC is to treat the  underlying cause, which in this case would be antibiotic  therapy directed against Neisseria meningitidis. For patients  such as this one who are experiencing bleeding related to  the DIC, attempts to correct the coagulopathy should be  undertaken. Platelet transfusions and fresh-frozen plasma  (FFP) should be given. In addition, cryoprecipitate is  indicated as the fibrinogen level is <100 mg/dL. In gen- eral, 10 U of cryoprecipitate are required for every 2 to  3 units of FFP. In acute DIC, heparin is not been dem- onstrated to be helpful and may increase bleeding. Low- dose heparin therapy (5â€“10 U/kg) is used for chronic  low-grade DIC such as that seen in acute promyelocytic  leukemia or removal of a dead fetus.","D. Heparin

Heparin is not indicated in this patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as it can worsen bleeding by further depleting clotting factors. The patient already has a low fibrinogen level and is at risk for bleeding, so heparin should be avoided in this case.",D. Heparin
51,All the following are vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagu- lation factors EXCEPT: A. Factor X B. Factor VII C. Protein C D. Protein S E. Factor VIII,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays  an essential role in hemostasis. It is absorbed in the small  intestine and stored in the liver. It serves as a cofactor in  the enzymatic carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on  prothrombin-complex proteins. The three major causes  of vitamin K deficiency are poor dietary intake, intesti- nal malabsorption, and liver disease. The prothrombin  complex proteins (factors II, VII, IX, and X and protein  C and protein S) all decrease with vitamin K deficiency.  Factor VII and protein C have the shortest half-lives  of these factors and therefore decrease first. Therefore,  vitamin K deficiency manifests with prolongation of the  prothrombin time first. With severe deficiency, the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time will be prolonged as  well. Factor VIII is not influenced by vitamin K.",E. Factor VIII,C. Protein C
52,A 31-year-old man with hemophilia A is admitted  with persistent gross hematuria. He denies recent  trauma and any history of genitourinary pathology.  The examination is unremarkable. Hematocrit is  28%. All the following are treatments for hemo- philia A EXCEPT: A. Desmopressin (DDAVP) B. Fresh-frozen plasma C. Cryoprecipitate D. Recombinant factor VIII E. Plasmapheresis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Hemophilia A results from a deficiency of  factor VIII. Replacement of factor VIII is the center- piece of treatment. Cessation of aspirin or nonsteroi- dal anti-inflammatory drugs is highly recommended.  Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains pooled plasma from  human sources. Cryoprecipitate refers to FFP that is  cooled, resulting in the precipitation of material at the  bottom of the plasma. This product contains about half  the factor VIII activity of FFP in a tenth of the volume.  Both agents are therefore reasonable treatment options.  DDAVP (desmopressin) causes the release of a number  of factors and von Willebrand factor from the liver and  endothelial cells. This may be useful for patients with  mild hemophilia. Recombinant or purified factor VIII  (i.e., Humate P) is indicated in patients with more severe  bleeding. Therapy may be required for weeks, with lev- els of factor VIII kept at 50%, for postsurgical or severe  bleeding. Plasmapheresis has no role in the treatment of  patients with hemophilia A.","E. Plasmapheresis

Plasmapheresis is not a treatment for hemophilia A. It is a procedure used to remove antibodies or other substances from the blood, but it is not typically used in the treatment of hemophilia A. The other options listed (Desmopressin, Fresh-frozen plasma, Cryoprecipitate, Recombinant factor VIII) are all commonly used treatments for hemophilia A.",E. Plasmapheresis
53,All of the following statements regarding the lupus  anticoagulant (LA) are true EXCEPT: A. LAs typically prolong the activated partial thrombo- plastin time. B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence  of LAs. C. Bleeding episodes in patients with LAs may be   severe and life threatening. D. Female patients may experience recurrent   midtrimester abortions. E. LAs may occur in the absence of other signs of   systemic lupus erythematosus.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 20) Lupus anticoagulants (Las) cause prolonga- tion of coagulation tests by binding to phospholipids.  Although most often encountered in patients with sys- temic lupus erythematosus, they may also develop in  normal individuals. The diagnosis is first suggested by  prolongation of coagulation tests. Failure to correct  with incubation with normal plasma confirms the pres- ence of a circulating inhibitor. Contrary to the name,  patients with LA activity have normal hemostasis and are  not predisposed to bleeding. Instead, they are at risk for  venous and arterial thromboembolisms. Patients with a  history of recurrent unplanned abortions or thrombosis  should undergo lifelong anticoagulation. The presence  of LAs or anticardiolipin antibodies without a history  of thrombosis may be observed because many of these  patients will not go on to develop a thrombotic event.",B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence of LAs.,A. LAs typically prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time.
54,All the following cause prolongation of the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time that does not  correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma  EXCEPT: A. Lupus anticoagulant B. Factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Factor VII inhibitor E. Factor IX inhibitor,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) involves the factors of the intrinsic pathway of  coagulation. Prolongation of the aPTT reflects either a  deficiency of one of these factors (factor VIII, IX, XI,  XII, and so on) or inhibition of the activity of one of the  factors or components of the aPTT assay (i.e., phospho- lipids). This may be further characterized by the â€œmix- ing studyâ€_x009d_ in which the patientâ€™s plasma is mixed with  pooled plasma. Correction of the aPTT reflects a defi- ciency of factors that are replaced by the pooled sample.  Failure to correct the aPTT reflects the presence of a fac- tor inhibitor or phospholipid inhibitor. Common causes  of a failure to correct include the presence of heparin in  the sample, factor inhibitors (factor VIII inhibitor being  the most common), and the presence of antiphospho- lipid antibodies. Factor VII is involved in the extrinsic  pathway of coagulation. Inhibitors to factor VII would  result in prolongation of the prothrombin time.",D. Factor VII inhibitor,D. Factor VII inhibitor
55,"You are evaluating a 45-year-old man with an acute  upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the emergency  department. He reports increasing abdominal girth  over the past 3 months associated with fatigue and  anorexia. He has not noticed any lower extremity  edema. His medical history is significant for hemo- philia A diagnosed as a child with recurrent elbow  hemarthroses in the past. He has been receiving infu- sions of factor VIII for most of his life and received  his last injection earlier that day. His blood pressure  is 85/45 mm Hg with a heart rate of 115 beats/ min. His abdominal examination is tense with a  positive fluid wave. Hematocrit is 21%. Renal func- tion and urinalysis results are normal. His activated  partial thromboplastin time is minimally prolonged,  his international normalized ratio is 2.7, and platelets  are normal. Which of the following is most likely  to yield a diagnosis for the cause of his GI bleeding? A. Factor VIII activity level B. Helicobacter pylori antibody test C. Hepatitis B surface antigen D. Hepatitis C RNA E. Mesenteric angiogram","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) This patient presents with a significant upper  gastrointestinal (GI) bleed with a prolonged prothrom- bin time (PT). Hemophilia should not cause a prolonged  PT. This and the presence of ascites raise the possibility  of liver disease and cirrhosis. The contamination of blood  products in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in widespread  transmission of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) within  the hemophilia population receiving factor infusions.    Review and Self-Assessment 769 It is estimated in 2006, that >80% of hemophilia patients  older than 20 years old are infected with HCV. Viral  inactivation steps were introduced in the 1980s, and  recombinant factor VIII and IX were first produced in  the 1990s. HCV is the major cause of morbidity and  the second leading cause of death in patients exposed  to older factor concentrates. Patients develop cirrhosis  and complications that include ascites and variceal bleed- ing. End-stage liver disease requiring a liver transplant is  curative for the cirrhosis and the hemophilia (the liver  produces factor VIII). Hepatitis B was not transmitted in  significant numbers to patients with hemophilia. Diver- ticular disease or peptic ulcer disease would not explain  the prolonged PT. Patients with inadequately repleted  factor VIII levels are more likely to develop hemarthro- ses than GI bleeds, and the slightly prolonged activated  partial thromboplastin time makes this unlikely.","E. Mesenteric angiogram

Given the patient's history of hemophilia A and acute upper GI bleed, a mesenteric angiogram would be the most likely test to yield a diagnosis for the cause of his bleeding. This test can help identify the source of bleeding in the GI tract, such as a vascular abnormality or arteriovenous malformation, which may be more common in patients with hemophilia. The other options listed are less likely to be the cause of his current presentation.",A. Factor VIII activity level
56,"You are managing a patient with suspected dis- seminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The  patient has end-stage liver disease awaiting liver  transplantation and was recently in the intensive  care unit with Escherichia coli bacterial peritonitis.

Platelet count is 43,000/Î¼L, international  normalized ratio is 2.5, hemoglobin is 6 mg/dL,  and d-dimer is elevated to 4.5. What is the best  way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and  chronic liver disease? A. Blood culture B. Elevated fibrinogen degradation products C. Prolonged aPTT D. Reduced platelet count E. Serial laboratory analysis  Review and Self-Assessment 737","The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) The differentiation between disseminated  intravascular coagulation (DIC) and severe liver disease  is challenging. Both entities may manifest with similar  laboratory findings, which are elevated fibrinogen deg- radation products, prolonged activated partial thrombo- plastin time and prothrombin time, anemia, and throm- bocytopenia. When suspecting DIC, these tests should  be repeated over a period of 6 to 8 hours because abnor- malities may change dramatically in patients with severe  DIC. In contrast, these test results should not fluctuate  as much in patients with severe liver disease. Bacterial  sepsis with positive blood cultures is a common cause of  DIC but is not diagnostic.","E. Serial laboratory analysis

The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease in this patient is to perform serial laboratory analysis. DIC is a dynamic process that can progress rapidly, so monitoring the patient's laboratory values over time can help differentiate between the two conditions. In DIC, there is typically a rapid decrease in platelet count, prolonged clotting times (such as aPTT), decreased fibrinogen levels, and elevated d-dimer levels. Chronic liver disease, on the other hand, may present with similar laboratory abnormalities but typically does not have the rapid progression seen in DIC. By monitoring the patient's laboratory values over time, you can assess for trends that are consistent with DIC.",The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease in this scenario is by evaluating the serial laboratory analysis.

Heterozygous protein C deficiency D. Prothrombin 20210G E. Tissue plasminogen activator,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 21) Venous thrombosis occurs through activation  of the coagulation cascade primarily through the expo- sure to tissue factor, and the genetic factors that contrib- ute to a predisposition to venous thrombosis typically  are polymorphisms affecting procoagulant or fibrinolytic  pathways. In contrast, arterial thrombosis occurs in the  setting a platelet activation, and the genetic predisposi- tion for arterial thrombosis includes mutations that affect  platelet receptors or redox enzymes. The most common  inherited risk factors for venous thrombosis are the factor  V Leiden mutation and prothrombin 20210 mutation.  Other mutations predisposing an individual to venous  thrombosis include inherited deficiency of protein C or  S and mutations of fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activa- tor, thrombomodulin, or plasminogen activator inhibitor.  The glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor mutation would  increase the risk of arterial, but not venous, thrombosis.",E. Tissue plasminogen activator,B. Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor
58,"A 76-year-old man presents to an urgent care clinic  with pain in his left leg for 4 days. He also describes  swelling in his left ankle, which has made it difficult  for him to ambulate. He is an active smoker and  has a medical history remarkable for gastroesopha- geal reflux disease, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)  9 months ago that resolved, and well-controlled  hypertension. Physical examination is revealing for  2+ edema in his left ankle. A d-dimer is ordered  and is elevated. Which of the following makes  d-dimer less predictive of DVT in this patient? A. Age older than 70 years B. History of active tobacco use C. Lack of suggestive clinical symptoms D. Negative Homanâ€™s sign on examination E. Previous DVT in the past year","The answer is A.  (Chap. 21) d-Dimer is a degradation product of cross- linked fibrin and is elevated in conditions of ongoing  thrombosis. Low concentrations of d-dimer are considered  to indicate the absence of thrombosis. Patients older than  the age of 70 years frequently have elevated d-dimers  in the absence of thrombosis, making this test less pre- dictive of acute disease. Clinical symptoms are often not  present in patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)  and do not affect interpretation of a d-dimer. Tobacco  use, although frequently considered a risk factor for  DVT, and previous DVT should not affect the predic- tive value of d-dimer. Homanâ€™s sign, calf pain elicited by  dorsiflexion of the foot, is not predictive of DVT and is  unrelated to d-dimer.","D. Negative Homan's sign on examination

Homan's sign is not a reliable indicator of DVT and its absence does not necessarily rule out the presence of a DVT. Other factors such as age, active tobacco use, and previous history of DVT can contribute to an elevated d-dimer level and increase the likelihood of DVT in this patient.",The lack of suggestive clinical symptoms makes d-dimer less predictive of DVT in this patient.
59,"A 22-year-old woman comes to the emergency  department complaining of 12 hours of shortness of  breath. The symptoms began toward the end of a  long car ride home from college. She has no medical  history, and her only medication is an oral contra- ceptive. She smokes occasionally, but the frequency  has increased recently because of examinations. On  physical examination, she is afebrile with respiratory  rate of 22 breaths/min, blood pressure of 120/80  mm Hg, heart rate of 110 beats/min, and oxygen  saturation on room air of 92%.

Check d-dimer and, if normal, obtain lower extrem- ity ultrasound. C. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, treat for deep-vein  thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. D. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast  multislice computed tomography scan of the chest. E. Obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography  scan of the chest.","The answer is E.  (Chaps. 21 and 22) The clinical probability of pulmonary  embolism (pulmonary embolism) can be delineated into  low to high likelihood using the clinical decision rule  shown in Table 22-1. In those with a score of 3 or less,  pulmonary embolism is low or moderately likely, and a  d-dimer test should be performed. A normal d-dimer  result combined with a low to moderate clinical prob- ability of pulmonary embolism identifies patients who  do not need further testing or anticoagulation therapy.  Those with either a likely clinical probability (score >3)  or an abnormal d-dimer (with unlikely clinical probabil- ity) require an imaging test to rule out pulmonary embo- lism. Currently, the most attractive imaging method to  detect pulmonary embolism is the multislice computed  tomography (CT). It is accurate and, if the result is nor- mal, safely rules out pulmonary embolism. This patient  has a clinical probability score of 4.5 because of her rest- ing tachycardia and the lack of an alternative diagnosis at  least as likely as pulmonary embolism. Therefore, there is  no indication for measuring d-dimer, and she should pro- ceed directly to multislice CT of the chest. If this cannot  be performed expeditiously, she should receive one dose  of low-molecular-weight heparin while awaiting the test.","D. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest.

Given the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and increased frequency of smoking, along with her age and use of oral contraceptives, there is a concern for pulmonary embolism. The first step in evaluating for pulmonary embolism is to check a d-dimer level. If the d-dimer is abnormal, further imaging with a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest is indicated to confirm the diagnosis. If the d-dimer is normal, other causes of shortness of breath should be considered.","D. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest."
60,All of the anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs listed  are correctly matched with their mechanisms of  action EXCEPT: A. Abciximabâ€”Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor   inhibitor B. Clopidogrelâ€”Adenosine diphosphate receptor  blockade C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition D. Rivaroxabanâ€”Factor Xa inhibition E. Warfarinâ€”Inhibition of production of the vitamin  Kâ€“dependent clotting factors,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 23) In recent years, a variety of new anticoagulant  and antiplatelet drugs have been developed for clinical use.   Platelets play an important role in arterial thrombosis,  particularly in coronary artery and cerebrovascular dis- ease. Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet drug  worldwide. Aspirin exerts its effects through inhibition of  cyclooxygenase-1. Other commonly used oral antiplatelet  agents are clopidogrel and dipyridamole. Clopidogrel is in  a class of agents called thienopyridines along with ticlopi- dine. Thienopyridines act to block a specific adenosine  diphosphate receptor (P2Y12) and inhibit platelet aggrega- tion. Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase to decrease  the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP) to decrease platelet aggregation. Intravenous  antiplatelet agents have also become increasingly impor- tant in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. All of  the intravenous agents act to inhibit platelet aggregation  by blocking the glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa receptor. The   Review and Self-Assessment 770 three agents in clinical use as Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors are  abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban.  Anticoagulant agents are primarily used for the preven- tion and treatment of venous thrombosis. Many antico- agulants are available and act by a variety of mechanisms.  Heparin has been used for many years but requires frequent  monitoring to be used safely. More recently, low-molec- ular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been introduced.  These agents are given subcutaneously and generally pre- ferred in many instances over heparin given a more predict- able anticoagulant effect. Both heparin and the LMWHs  are indirect thrombin inhibitors that act primarily through  activation of antithrombin. When activated, antithrombin  inhibits clotting enzymes, especially thrombin and factor  Xa. Fondaparinux is a newer anticoagulant that inhibits  only factor Xa, although it is a synthetic analogue of the  pentasaccharide sequence in heparin that binds antithrom- bin. However, it is too short to bridge antithrombin to  thrombin. The direct thrombin inhibitors bind directly to  thrombin (rather than antithrombin) to exert their activ- ity. The direct thrombin inhibitors include lepirudin, arg- atroban, and bivalirudin. The most commonly used oral  anticoagulant is warfarin, which inhibits the production  of vitamin Kâ€“dependent clotting factors. Given the need  for frequent monitoring and extensive drug interactions,  developing other oral anticoagulants that are safe and effec- tive has been desired for many years. No oral drug has yet  been introduced into the market. However, several are in  the final stages of development. These include two factor  Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and one factor IIa  inhibitor (dabigatran etexilate).","C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition

Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that acts by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, leading to inhibition of factor Xa. It does not directly inhibit thrombin.",C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition
61,"A 66-year-old woman is prescribed clopidogrel  and aspirin after implantation of a bare metal stent  in her right coronary artery. Two weeks after the  procedure, the woman presents to the emergency  department with acute-onset chest pain and elec- trocardiographic changes consistent with an acute  inferior myocardial infarction. Emergent cardiac  catheterization confirms in-stent restenosis. The  patient insists she has been adherent to her pre- scribed therapy. Which of the following state- ments most correctly described the most likely  cause of the patientâ€™s restenosis despite her current  therapy? A. She likely has aspirin resistance and should be treated  with higher doses of aspirin to prevent a recurrence. B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a  genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway. C. She should have been treated with low-molecular- weight heparin to prevent this complication. D. She should have been treated with warfarin to pre- vent this complication. E. Because she has demonstrated resistance to clopido- grel, switching to prasugrel would not be useful to  prevent further complications.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) After implantation of a bare metal coronary  artery stent, aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended  for at least 4 weeks to decrease the risk of in-stent reste- nosis. This patient, however, developed the complica- tion despite adherence to her therapy. This generally  suggests resistance to clopidogrel with a decreased ability  of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregation. There is  a known genetic component to clopidogrel resistance  related to specific genetic polymorphisms of the CYP  isoenzymes. Up to 25% of whites, 30% of African Amer- icans, and 50% of Asians may carry an allele that renders  them resistant to clopidogrel. These polymorphisms are  less important in the activation of prasugrel. Thus, in  individuals who have evidence of clopidogrel resistance,  switching to prasugrel should be considered.  Aspirin resistance is a more controversial subject. It  is defined simply in clinical terms as failure of aspirin to  prevent ischemic vascular events. Biochemically, aspirin  resistance can be defined by failure of usual doses of the  drug to produce inhibitory effects on platelet function.  However, resistance to aspirin is not reversed by higher  doses of aspirin or adding another antiplatelet agent.  Because the primary mechanism of arterial thrombosis  is platelet aggregation, the anticoagulant agents warfarin  and low-molecular-weight heparin are not indicated.","B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires activation by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway in order to exert its antiplatelet effects. Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP pathway can lead to variability in clopidogrel metabolism, resulting in reduced effectiveness of the drug. This can lead to in-stent restenosis despite adherence to therapy. Switching to a different P2Y12 inhibitor, such as prasugrel, may be more effective in patients with clopidogrel resistance.","E. Because she has demonstrated resistance to clopidogrel, switching to prasugrel would not be useful to prevent further complications."
62,"A 48-year-old woman is diagnosed with a deep- vein thrombosis of her left lower extremity.

Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection D. Lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia E. Predictable anticoagulant effect","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs)  have largely replaced heparin for most indications if a  patient does not have any contraindications to therapy.  LMWHs have better bioavailability and longer half-lives  after subcutaneous injection. Thus, they can be given at  routine intervals for both prophylaxis and treatment. In  addition, dosing of LMWHs is simplified because these  drugs have a dose-independent clearance, and predict- able anticoagulant effects means that monitoring of anti- coagulant effect is not required in most patients. Finally,  LMWHs have a lower risk of heparin-induced throm- bocytopenia, which is important in both short- and  long-term administration.","B. Dose-dependent clearance

Low-molecular-weight heparins have a more predictable anticoagulant effect, better bioavailability, longer half-life after subcutaneous injection, and a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia compared to unfractionated heparin. Dose-dependent clearance is a characteristic of unfractionated heparin, not low-molecular-weight heparins.",D. Lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

(Chap. 22) The d-dimer measured by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is elevated in the setting  of breakdown of fibrin by plasmin, and the presence of  a positive d-dimer can prompt the need for additional  imaging for deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary  embolus in specific clinical situations in which the patient  would be considered to have an elevation in d-dimer.  However, one must be cautious about placing value on  an elevated d-dimer in other situations when there can  be an alternative explanation for the elevated level. Of  the scenarios listed in the question, the only patient who  would be expected to have a negative d-dimer result  would be the patient with calf pain and recent air travel.  The presence of a normal alveolarâ€“arterial oxygen gradi- ent cannot reliably differentiate between those with and  without pulmonary embolism. In all the other scenarios,  elevations in d-dimer could be related to other medi- cal conditions and provide no diagnostic information  to inform the clinician regarding the need for further  evaluation. Some common clinical situations in which  the d-dimer is elevated include sepsis, myocardial infarc- tion, cancer, pneumonia, the postoperative state, and the  second and third trimesters of pregnancy.","The patients in which a positive d-dimer would prompt additional testing for a pulmonary embolus are:

C. A 56-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer
D. A 62-year-old man who underwent hip replacement surgery 4 weeks previously

Patients with cancer and those who have undergone recent surgery are at higher risk for developing pulmonary embolism, so a positive d-dimer in these patients would warrant further investigation.",A. A 24-year-old woman who is 32 weeks pregnant
64,A 62-year-old woman is hospitalized following  an acute pulmonary embolism. All of the follow- ing would typically indicate a massive pulmonary  embolism EXCEPT: A. Elevated serum troponin levels B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis C. Initial presentation with syncope D. Presence of right ventricular enlargement on CT  scan of the chest E. Presence of right ventricular hypokinesis on   echocardiogram,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) Clinically, individuals with massive pulmonary  embolus present with hypotension, syncope, or cyanosis.  The hypotension and syncope occur due to acute right ven- tricular overload, and elevated troponin or amino terminal   (NT)-pro-brain natriuretic peptide can result from this  right ventricular strain. Both elevated troponin and NT- pro-brain natriuretic peptide predict worse outcomes in  pulmonary embolism. Further prognostic signs of massive  pulmonary embolism include the presence of right ventric- ular enlargement on computed tomography of the chest  or right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiography.   The presence of hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, or   Review and Self-Assessment 771 cough in association with pulmonary embolism most  commonly indicates a small peripheral lesion.","A. Elevated serum troponin levels

Elevated serum troponin levels are typically seen in cases of myocardial infarction or heart muscle damage, not necessarily in cases of pulmonary embolism. The other options are more commonly associated with a massive pulmonary embolism.",A. Elevated serum troponin levels
65,"Which of the following statements regarding diag- nostic imaging in pulmonary embolism is TRUE? A. A high probability ventilationâ€“perfusion scan is one  that has at least one segmental perfusion defect in the  setting of normal ventilation. B. If a patient has a high probability ventilationâ€“  perfusion scan, there is a 90% likelihood that the  patient does indeed have a pulmonary embolism. C. Magnetic resonance angiography provides excel- lent resolution for both large proximal and smaller  segmental pulmonary emboli. D. Multidetector-row spiral CT imaging is suboptimal  for detecting small peripheral emboli, necessitating  the use of invasive pulmonary angiography. E. None of the routinely used imaging techniques  provide adequate evaluation of the right ventricle to  assist in risk stratification of the patient.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) For many years, ventilationâ€“perfusion imag- ing (V-Q) was the standard for the diagnosis of pulmo- nary embolism (pulmonary embolism). Determination of  abnormal V-Q imaging can be difficult. To call a V-Q  scan a high-probability scan, one needs to see two or more  segmental perfusion defects in the setting of normal venti- lation. In patients with underlying lung disease, however,  ventilation is frequently abnormal, and most patients with  pulmonary embolism do not actually have high-probabil- ity V-Q scans. When there is a high-probability V-Q scan,  the likelihood of pulmonary embolism is 90% or greater.  Alternatively, patients with normal perfusion imaging  have a very low likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Most  patients fall into either the low or intermediate probabil- ity of having a pulmonary embolism by V-Q imaging.  In this setting, 40% of patients with a high clinical suspi- cion of pulmonary embolism are determined by pulmo- nary angiography to indeed have a pulmonary embolism  despite having a low-probability V-Q scan. At the present  time, V-Q scanning is largely supplanted by multidetec- tor-row spiral computed tomography (CT) angiography  of the chest. Compared with conventional CT scanning  with intravenous contrast, the multidetector spiral CT can  provide evaluation of the pulmonary arteries to the sixth- order branches, a level of resolution that is as good as or  exceeds that of conventional invasive pulmonary angiog- raphy. In addition, the CT allows evaluation of the right  and left ventricles as well as the lung parenchyma to pro- vide additional information regarding prognosis in acute  pulmonary embolism or alternative diagnosis in the patient  with dyspnea. Magnetic resonance angiography is a rarely  used alternative to the above modalities in patients with  contrast dye allergy. This technique provides the ability to  detect large proximal PEs but lacks reliability for segmental  and subsegmental pulmonary embolism.",E. None of the routinely used imaging techniques provide adequate evaluation of the right ventricle to assist in risk stratification of the patient.,"D. Multidetector-row spiral CT imaging is suboptimal for detecting small peripheral emboli, necessitating the use of invasive pulmonary angiography."
66,"A 53-year-old woman presents to the hospital fol- lowing an episode of syncope, with ongoing light- headedness and shortness of breath. She had a history  of antiphospholipid syndrome with prior pulmo- nary embolism and has been nonadherent to her  anticoagulation medication recently. She has been  prescribed warfarin, 7.5 mg daily, but reports taking  it only intermittently. She does not know her most  recent INR. On presentation to the emergency  department, she appears diaphoretic and tachy- pneic. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pres- sure of 86/44 mm Hg, heart rate of 130 beats/min,     respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, and oxygen satu- ration of 85% on room air. Cardiovascular examina- tion shows a regular tachycardia without murmurs,  rubs, or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation.  On extremity examination, there is swelling of her  left thigh with a positive Homanâ€™s sign. Chest CT  angiography confirms a saddle pulmonary embolus  with ongoing clot seen in the pelvic veins on the  left. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is  administered. After a fluid bolus of 1 L, the patientâ€™s  blood pressure remains low at 88/50 mm Hg.  Echocardiogram demonstrates hypokinesis of the  right ventricle. On 100% non-rebreather mask, the  oxygen saturation is 92%. What is the next best step  in the management of this patient? A. Continue current management. B. Continue IV fluids at 500 mL/h for a total of 4 L of  fluid resuscitation. C. Refer for inferior vena cava filter placement and  continue current management. D. Refer for surgical embolectomy. E. Treat with dopamine and recombinant tissue plas- minogen activator, 100 mg IV.","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) This patient is presenting with massive pul- monary embolus (pulmonary embolism) with ongoing  hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and profound  hypoxemia requiring 100% oxygen. In this setting, con- tinuing with anticoagulation alone is inadequate, and  the patient should receive circulatory support with fibri- nolysis if there are no contraindications to therapy. The  major contraindications to fibrinolysis include hyperten- sion >180/110 mm Hg, known intracranial disease or  prior hemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery, or trauma. The  recommended fibrinolytic regimen is recombinant tissue   plasminogen activator (rTPA), 100 mg IV over 2 hours.  Heparin should be continued with the fibrinolytic to pre- vent a rebound hypercoagulable state with dissolution of the  clot. There is a 10% risk of major bleeding with fibrinolytic  therapy, with a 1â€“3% risk of intracranial hemorrhage.   The only indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolism  is for massive pulmonary embolism presenting with life- threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and  refractory hypoxemia. In submassive pulmonary embolism  presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of  right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the deci- sion to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case basis.  In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive  circulatory support with vasopressors. Dopamine and  dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treat- ment of shock in pulmonary embolism. Caution should be  taken with ongoing high-volume fluid administration, as  a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly toler- ant of additional fluids. Ongoing fluids may worsen right  ventricular ischemia and further dilate the right ventricle,  displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen  cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contra- indications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized  with vasopressor support, referral for surgical embolec- tomy should be considered. Referral for inferior vena cava  filter placement is not indicated at this time. The patient  should be stabilized hemodynamically as a first priority.  The indications for inferior vena cava filter placement are  active bleeding, precluding anticoagulation, and recurrent  deep-vein thrombosis on adequate anticoagulation.","E. Treat with dopamine and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 100 mg IV.

This patient is presenting with a massive pulmonary embolism and signs of hemodynamic instability, including hypotension and right ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with thrombolytic therapy, such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, is indicated in this situation to help dissolve the clot and improve hemodynamics. Dopamine can also be used to help support blood pressure in this setting. Continuing current management or IV fluids alone may not be sufficient in this case. Referral for surgical embolectomy or inferior vena cava filter placement may be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated or unsuccessful.",The next best step in the management of this patient would be to refer for surgical embolectomy.
67,"A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency  department with acute onset of shortness of breath.  She recently had been to visit her parents out of state  and rode in a car for about 9 hours each way. Two  days ago, she developed mild calf pain and swelling,  but she thought that this was not unusual after having  been sitting with her legs dependent for the recent  trip. On arrival to the emergency department, she is  noted to be tachypneic. The vital signs are as follows:     blood pressure of 98/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 114  beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, oxygen  saturation of 92% on room air, and weight of 89 kg.  The lungs are clear bilaterally. There is pain in the  right calf with dorsiflexion of the foot, and the right  leg is more swollen compared with the left. An arterial  blood gas measurement shows a pH of 7.52, PCO2 25  mm Hg, and PO2 68 mm Hg. Kidney and liver func- tion are normal. A helical CT scan confirms a pulmo- nary embolus. All of the following agents can be used  alone as initial therapy in this patient EXCEPT: A. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC twice daily B. Fondaparinux 7.5 mg SC once daily C. Tinzaparin 175 U/kg SC once daily D. Unfractionated heparin IV adjusted to maintain  activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two to  three times the upper limit of normal E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2â€“3  Review and Self-Assessment 739","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) Warfarin should not be used alone as ini- tial therapy for the treatment of venous thromboem- bolic disease (VTE) for two reasons. First, warfarin does  not achieve full anticoagulation for at least 5 days, as its  mechanism of action is to decrease the production of  vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagulation factors in the liver.  Second, a paradoxical reaction that promotes coagu- lation may also occur upon initiation of warfarin as it  also decreases the production of the vitamin Kâ€“depen- dent anticoagulants protein C and protein S, which  have shorter half-lives than the procoagulant factors.  For many years, unfractionated heparin delivered intra- venously was the treatment of choice for VTE. How- ever, it requires frequent monitoring of activated partial  thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels and hospitalization  until therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR)  is achieved with warfarin. There are now several safe  and effective alternatives to unfractionated heparin that  can be delivered SC. Low-molecular-weight heparins  (enoxaparin, tinzaparin) are fragments of unfraction- ated heparin with a lower molecular weight. These  compounds have a greater bioavailability, longer half- life, and more predictable onset of action. Their use in  renal insufficiency should be considered with  caution  because low-molecular-weight heparins are renally  cleared. Fondaparinux is a direct factor Xa inhibitor   that, like low-molecular-weight heparins, requires no   Review and Self-Assessment 772 monitoring of anticoagulant effects and has been demon- strated to be safe and effective in treating both deep-vein  thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.","E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2-3

Warfarin is not typically used as initial therapy for a pulmonary embolism because it takes several days to reach therapeutic levels. Instead, initial therapy usually involves a parenteral anticoagulant such as enoxaparin, fondaparinux, or tinzaparin, or unfractionated heparin.",D. Unfractionated heparin IV adjusted to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two to three times the upper limit of normal

(Chap. 26) Although cigarette smoking is the greatest  modifiable risk factor for the development of cancer, the  most significant risk factor for cancer in general is age.  Two-thirds of all cancers are diagnosed in individuals  older than 65 years, and the risk of developing cancer  between the ages of 60 and 79 years is one in three in  men and one in five in women. In contrast, the risk of  cancer between birth and age 49 years is one in 70 for  boys and men and one in 48 for girls and women.

She continues to smoke 1 to 2 packs  of cigarettes every day. She requires oxygen at 2 L/ min continuously and is functionally quite limited.  She currently is able to attend to all of her activities  of daily living, including showering and dressing. She  retired from her work as a waitress 10 years previously  because of her lung disease. At home, she does attend  to some of the household chores but is not able to  use a vacuum. She goes out once or twice weekly  to run typical errands and drives.

How would  you categorize her performance status and prognosis  for treatment taking this into consideration? A. She has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) grade of 1 and has a good prognosis with  appropriate therapy. B. She has an ECOG grade of 2 and has a good prog- nosis with appropriate therapy. C. She has an ECOG grade of 3 and has a good prog- nosis with appropriate therapy. D. She has an ECOG grade of 3 and has a poor progno- sis despite therapy. E. She has an ECOG grade of 4 and has a poor progno- sis that precludes therapy.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 26) Although tumor burden is certainly a major  factor in determining cancer outcomes, it is also important  to consider the functional status of the patient when con- sidering the therapeutic plan. The physiologic stresses of  undergoing surgical interventions, radiation therapy, and  chemotherapy can exhaust the limited reserves of a patient  with multiple medical problems. It is clearly difficult to  adequately measure the physiologic reserves of a patient,  and most oncologists use performance status measures as a  surrogate. Two of the most commonly used measures of  performance status are the Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky performance status. The  ECOG scale provides a grade between 0 (fully active) and  5 (dead). Most patients are considered to have adequate  reserve for undergoing treatment if the performance sta- tus is 0 to 2, with a grade 2 indicating someone who is  ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable carry out  work activities. These individuals are up and about >50%  of waking hours. A grade 3 performance score indicates  someone who is capable of only limited self-care and is  confined to a bed or chair >50% of waking hours. The  Karnofsky score ranges from 0 (dead) to 100 (normal) and  is graded at 10-point intervals. A Karnofsky score of <70  also indicates someone with poor performance status.","B. She has an ECOG grade of 2 and has a good prognosis with appropriate therapy. 

Despite her significant comorbidities and functional limitations, the fact that she is still able to attend to her activities of daily living and go out for errands suggests that she may still benefit from treatment for her breast cancer. With appropriate therapy and support, she may have a good prognosis.",She has an ECOG grade of 3 and has a good prognosis with appropriate therapy.

72,"Which of the following statements regarding cur- rent understanding of the genetic changes that must  occur for a cell to become cancerous is TRUE? A. Caretaker genes determine when a cell enters into a  replicative phase and must acquire mutations to   allow unregulated cell growth. B. For a cell to become cancerous, it is estimated that a  minimum of 20 mutations must occur. C. For a tumor suppressor gene to become inactivated  and allow unregulated cell growth, both copies of  the gene must have mutations. D. Oncogenes act in an autosomal recessive fashion. E. Within a cancer, there are generally two to five cells  of origin.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 24) Cancer occurs when a single cell acquires a  series of genetic mutations that allow the cell to prolifer- ate without regulation. The clonal nature of cancer is a  key feature that allows a malignancy to be differentiated  from hyperplasia, in which polyclonality is seen. Sig- nificant research has occurred over the past decades that  allows us to understand the genetic causes of cancer in  greater detail, and new research is providing a growing  knowledge of cancer of any number of cell types with  the hopes that future therapies can be personalized to  the mutations that are present in the individual cancer.  Based on laboratory research, it is thought that five to 10  mutations are needed for a cell to transform into a malig- nant cancer, although often many more mutations can  be seen. The major genes involved in cancer are onco- genes and tumor-suppressor genes. Both of these types  of genes contribute to the malignant phenotype by lead- ing to unregulated cell division or the ability to avoid  programmed cell death. Oncogenes require only a single  mutation to become activated and act in an autosomal  dominant fashion. In contrast, tumor-suppressor genes  require both copies of the allele to become inactivated  to lose their protective effects against unregulated cell  growth. Caretaker genes are a subset of tumor-suppressor   genes and have no direct effect on cell growth. These  genes function to help the cell protect the integrity of its  genome by repairing DNA defects that occur.","C. For a tumor suppressor gene to become inactivated and allow unregulated cell growth, both copies of the gene must have mutations.","C. For a tumor suppressor gene to become inactivated and allow unregulated cell growth, both copies of the gene must have mutations."
73,All the following conditions are associated with an  increased incidence of cancer EXCEPT: A. Down syndrome B. Fanconiâ€™s anemia C. von Hippelâ€“Lindau syndrome D. Neurofibromatosis E. Fragile X syndrome,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 24) A small proportion of cancers occur in  patients with a genetic predisposition. Roughly 100  syndromes of familial cancer have been reported.

74,Cancer therapy is increasingly personalized with  targeted small molecule therapies that are directed  against specific signal transduction pathways that  are commonly activated in a particular cell type of  cancer. Which of the following therapies is cor- rectly matched with its molecular target? A. Bevacizumabâ€”EGFR B. Erlotinibâ€”VEGF C. Imatinibâ€”Bcr-Abl D. Rituximabâ€”CD45 E. Sunitinibâ€”RAF,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 25) Cancer treatment is undergoing a revolu- tion with an increasing number of therapies that are  directed specifically against signal transduction path- ways. These pathways are often activated in cancer cells  and contribute to the malignant phenotype of the cell.  One commonly affected signal transduction pathway is  that of tyrosine kinase. Typically, tyrosine kinase is only  active for a very short period. However, in malignant  cells, the tyrosine kinase pathway can be constitutively  activated through mutation, gene amplification, or gene  translocation. Small molecule therapy that can inhibit a  tyrosine kinase pathway can lead to decreased prolifera- tion of malignant cells, decreased survival, and impeded  angiogenesis. Examples of targeted small molecule thera- pies and their molecular targets can be found in Table  25-2. These include drugs as well as monoclonal anti- bodies. Among the first small molecule therapies to be  used in malignancy was imatinib, which has dramatically  changed therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia. This drug  targets the activated tyrosine kinase pathway activated by  the Bcr-Abl mutation that is present in this disease.  Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted against  pathways in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  and is used in lung and colon cancer. It had previously  been used for breast cancer, but the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration has recommended against its use in breast  cancer as of November 2011 (www.fda.gov, accessed  December 1, 2011). Erlotinib and gefitinib are active  against tumors carrying mutations of the epidermal growth  factor receptor, especially in lung cancer. Rituximab has  been used for many years and is an anti-CD20. Its most  common use is in B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, but  it is undergoing trials for use in autoimmune disease as  well. Sunitinib and sorafenib both have activity against a  large number of kinases.

A 24-year-old man with a history of osteosarcoma  of the left femur with a 1-cm metastasis to his right  lower lobe referred for right lower lobectomy B. A 56-year-old woman with a history of colon cancer  with three metastases to the left lobe of the liver  referred for left hepatic lobectomy C. A 72-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer  to several vertebrae referred for orchiectomy D. All of the above E. None of the above,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 28) Generally, when metastatic disease is  observed, surgical interventions do not change the out- come of a particular cancer. However, in a few instances,  one should consider surgery as potentially curative. One  example is metastatic osteosarcoma to the lung, which  can be cured by resection of the lung lesion. There are  other instances in which surgery may be effective in  patients with metastatic disease. In nonâ€“small cell lung  cancer, individual with a solitary brain metastasis at the  time of diagnosis may also be treated with resection of  the brain and lung lesions in a staged fashion. In colon  cancer with liver metastases, hepatic lobectomy may  produce long-term disease-free survival in as many as  25% of individuals if fewer than five lesions are observed  in a single hepatic lobe. Another role for surgical resec- tion in metastatic disease is to remove the source of  hormone production that can stimulate cancer growth.  This is occasionally recommended in prostate cancer,  although antiandrogen therapy is most commonly used.","A. A 24-year-old man with a history of osteosarcoma of the left femur with a 1-cm metastasis to his right lower lobe referred for right lower lobectomy

This patient is potentially curable by surgical resection as the metastasis is limited to one lobe of the lung and the primary tumor is osteosarcoma, which is known to be responsive to surgery.

B. A 56-year-old woman with a history of colon cancer with three metastases to the left lobe of the liver referred for left hepatic lobectomy

This patient is not potentially curable by surgical resection as there are multiple metastases to the liver, indicating widespread disease.

C. A 72-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer to several vertebrae referred for orchiectomy

This patient is not potentially curable by surgical resection as the cancer has already spread to multiple vertebrae, indicating advanced disease.

77,You are studying a new chemotherapeutic agent  for use in advanced colorectal carcinoma and have  completed a phase II clinical trial. Which of the fol- lowing factors indicates that the drug is suitable for  study in a phase III clinical trial? A. Complete response rates of 10â€“15% B. Increased disease-free survival rates by 1 month C. Increased overall survival by 1 month D. Partial response rate of 20â€“25% E. Partial response rates of 50% or more,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 28) Clinical trials in cancer drug discovery fol- lows a stepwise process before the drug is determined  to be safe and effective for treatment of a specific can- cer. Before proceeding to trials in human, cancer drugs  must demonstrate antitumor activity with a specific dose  and interval in animal trials. After this, drugs enter phase  I trials to establish safe dosage range and side effects in  humans. Clinical antitumor effect is observed, but phase  II trials enroll a larger group of people to more rigorously  quantify antitumor effects in humans. Further side effect  data is collected as well. The dose given in phase II trials  is the maximal tolerated dose determined in phase I trials.  Although phase I trials often given escalating doses of an  agent, phase II trials use a fixed dose, and the drug is given  to only a very select and homogeneous group of patients.  An agent is determined to be â€œactiveâ€_x009d_ and may proceed to  a phase III trial if there is a partial regression rate of at least  20â€“25% with reversible nonâ€“life-threatening side effects.  Phase III trials enroll the largest numbers of patients and  often compare the drug with standard therapies for the  particular cancer. Phase IV trials occur after release of the  drug and are called postmarketing studies. These trials  provide important information about risks, benefits, and  optimal use in the general population of patients with a  particular cancer, which can often be quite different than  those patients enrolled in a clinical trial.","C. Increased overall survival by 1 month

This factor indicates that the drug is having a significant impact on patient outcomes, making it suitable for further study in a phase III clinical trial.

She presents 8 days after her  last treatment to the emergency department with a  fever of 104.1Â°F (40.1Â°C). She has chills, rigors, and  a headache. Her chest radiograph, urinalysis, and  tunneled intravenous catheter site show no obvious  evidence of infection. Her white blood cell count  upon presentation is 500/Î¼L (0% neutrophils, 50%  monocytes, 50% lymphocytes). Blood cultures are  drawn peripherally and through the catheter.

Blood cultures are negative at 48 hours. His  neutrophil count is 1,550/Î¼L. What is the best  approach to the management of this patient? A. Removal of catheter alone B. Treatment with ceftazidime and vancomycin C. Treatment with topical antibiotics at the catheter site D. Treatment with vancomycin alone E. Treatment with vancomycin and removal of   catheter","The answer is E.  (Chap. 28) Myelosuppression predictably occurs after  administration of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents.  Antimetabolites and anthracyclines (including doxorubi- cin) typically cause neutropenia between 6 and 14 days  after administration of the agent. Febrile neutropenia  is diagnosed based on a single temperature >38.5Â°C or  three temperatures >38.0Â°C. Treatment of febrile neu- tropenia conventionally includes initiation of treatment  with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If there is no obvious  site of infection, then coverage for Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa is recommended. Active antibiotics include third-  or fourth-generation cephalosporins (including ceftazi- dime), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, and  aminoglycosides. Vancomycin should be considered in  this patient because of her tunneled intravenous cath- eter despite the apparent lack of cutaneous infection  and would be continued until culture demonstrated the  absence of a resistant organism. There is no need for an  antifungal agent because this patient has not had pro- longed neutropenia, and this is the first fever recorded.  Moreover, given the chemotherapy given, the expected  duration of neutropenia is expected to be relatively brief.  In many instances such as this, oral antibiotics such as  ciprofloxacin can be given.  There is no role for granulocyte transfusions in the  treatment. However, the use of colony-stimulating fac- tors often is considered. These agents have historically  been overused, and the American Society of Clinical  Oncology has developed practice guidelines to assist  in determining which patients should receive colony-  stimulating factors. Briefly, there is no evidence for ben- efit in either febrile or afebrile neutropenic patients, and  they should not routinely be used in acute myeloid leu- kemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. The only thera- peutic use is in individuals who have undergone bone  marrow or stem cell transplantation to speed myeloid  recovery. The primary use of colony-stimulating factors  is in the setting of prevention. Because this patient has  now experienced an episode of febrile neutropenia, she  should be given colony-stimulating factors beginning 24  to 72 hours after chemotherapy administration, and the  medication should continue until the neutrophil count  is 10,000/Î¼L or greater. Colony-stimulating factors may  be given after the first cycle of chemotherapy if the like- lihood of febrile neutropenia is >20%, if the patient has  preexisting neutropenia or active infection, if the patient  is older than 65 years of age and is being treated for lym- phoma, or if the patient has a poor performance status or  has had extensive prior chemotherapy.","The next step in the treatment of the patient with stage III breast cancer who presents with fever, chills, rigors, and a headache, along with a low white blood cell count, is to start empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Given her recent chemotherapy with doxorubicin, she is at high risk for neutropenic fever, which is a medical emergency. The choice of antibiotics should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, as well as potential fungal infections. Therefore, the best approach would be to start treatment with ceftazidime and vancomycin.","Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms, would be the next step in the treatment of the patient with stage III breast cancer presenting with fever and neutropenia."
79,What is the most common side effect of chemo- therapy? A. Alopecia B. Diarrhea C. Febrile neutropenia D. Mucositis E. Nausea with or without vomiting,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 28) Nausea with or without vomiting is the  most common side effect of chemotherapy. It can  be anticipatory in nature, acute, or occur >24 hours  after administration. Patients at increased risk of nau- sea include younger patients, women, and those with  a history of motion or morning sickness. The chemo- therapeutic agents used also alter the risk of nausea and  vomiting. Highly emetogenic drugs include high-dose  cyclophosphamide and cisplatin. Low-risk drugs include  fluorouracil, taxanes, and etoposide. In patients receiv- ing high-risk regimens, prophylactic treatment with a   combination of medications acting at different sites is  recommended. Typically, the regimen would include   Review and Self-Assessment 775 a serotonin antagonist such as dolasetron, a neurokine  receptor antagonist such are aprepitant, and potent cor- ticosteroids such as dexamethasone.","E. Nausea with or without vomiting

She is doing well with- out evidence of recurrent disease but has had mani- festations of chronic graft-versus-host disease. She  should be administered all of the following vaccines  EXCEPT: A. Diphtheriaâ€“tetanus B. Influenza C. Measles, mumps, and rubella D. Poliomyelitis via injection E. 23-Valent pneumococcal polysaccharide","The answer is C.  (Chap. 29) Patients who have undergone allogeneic  stem cell transplant remain at risk for infectious com- plications for an extended period despite engraftment  and apparent return of normal hematopoietic capac- ity. Individuals with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)  often require immunosuppressive treatment that further  increases their infectious risk. Prevention of infection is  the goal in these individuals, and the clinician should  ensure appropriate vaccinations for all patients who have  undergone intensive chemotherapy, have been treated  for Hodgkinâ€™s disease, or have undergone hematopoietic  stem cell transplant. No vaccines except influenza should  be given before 12 months after transplant. Then the  only vaccines that should be given are inactivated vac- cines. Therefore, oral vaccine for poliomyelitis and the  varicella zoster vaccine are contraindicated. The measles,  mump, and rubella vaccine is also a live virus vaccine  but can be safely given after 24 months if the patient  does not have GVHD. Other recommended vaccines  include diphtheriaâ€“tetanus, inactivated poliomyelitis  (by injection), Haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis  B, and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.  Meningococcal vaccination is recommended in splenec- tomized patients and in those living in endemic areas,  including college dormitories.","D. Poliomyelitis via injection

Hypogammaglobulinemia C. Impaired T-cell function with normal T-lymphocyte  counts D. Low CD4 count E. No specific abnormality is expected.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 29) Specific malignancies are associated with  underlying immune dysfunction and infection with  specific organisms. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and  multiple myeloma may have an associated hypogamma- globulinemia. Individuals with these disorders are at risk  of infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus  influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Although immu- noglobulin therapy is effective, it is more cost effective  to give prophylactic antibiotics in these patients. Acute  myeloid or lymphocytic leukemias often have an associ- ated neutropenia and may present with overwhelming  infection from extracellular bacteria and fungi, especially  if the duration of neutropenia is prolonged. Patients with  lymphomatous disorders often have abnormal T cell  function despite normal numbers of T cells. Moreover,  most patients also receive treatment with high doses  of glucocorticoids that further impair T cell function.  These individuals have an increased risk of infection  with intracellular pathogens and may contract pneumo- nia with Pneumocystis jiroveci.","B. Hypogammaglobulinemia

He is found ,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 29) Clinicians are often faced with treat- ment decisions regarding catheter-related infections in  patients who are immunocompromised from cancer and   chemotherapy. Because many patients require several  weeks of chemotherapy, tunneled catheters are often  placed, and determining the need for catheter removal is  an important consideration. When blood culture results  are positive or there is evidence of infection along the  track of the tunnel, catheter removal is recommended.  When the erythema is limited to the exit site only, then  it is not necessary to remove the catheter unless the ery- thema fails to respond to treatment. The recommended  treatment for an exit site infection should be directed  against coagulase-negative staphylococci. In the options  presented, vancomycin alone is the best option for treat- ment. There is no need to add therapy for gram-negative  organisms because the patient does not have neutropenia  and has negative culture results.","to have neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 800 cells/mm3. The patient is at risk for developing febrile neutropenia, a serious complication of chemotherapy that can lead to life-threatening infections.

The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. He will likely require broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat any potential infections. In addition, he may need to receive growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to help stimulate the production of white blood cells and reduce the risk of infection.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's temperature, blood counts, and overall clinical status. Prompt recognition and treatment of febrile neutropenia are essential to prevent serious complications and improve outcomes for patients undergoing chemotherapy.",The patient in the scenario is likely experiencing a fever as a result of the chemotherapy treatment he is undergoing for stage IIIB adenocarcinoma of the lung.
83,All of the following statements regarding the dif- ference between breast cancer in pregnant versus  nonpregnant women are true EXCEPT: A. Estrogen-positive tumors are more common in  pregnant women. B. Her-2 positivity is more common in pregnant  women. C. A higher stage is more common in pregnant   women. D. Positive lymph nodes are more common in pregnant  women. E. Tumor size at diagnosis is larger in pregnant   women.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 31) Breast cancer in pregnant women is defined  as cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or up to 1 year  after delivery. Only about 5% of all breast cancers occur  in women younger than 40 years of age, and of those,  approximately 25% are pregnancy-associated cancer.  Needle biopsy of breast masses in pregnant women is  often nondiagnostic, and false-positive test results may  occur. Breast cancers diagnosed during pregnancy have  a worse outcome than other breast cancers. The cancers  tend to be diagnosed at a later stage (often the signs are  thought to be related to pregnancy) and tend to have a  more aggressive behavior. Approximately 30% of breast  cancers found in pregnancy are estrogen receptor posi- tive in contrast to 60â€“70% being estrogen receptor posi- tive overall. Larger tumor size, positive axillary nodes,  Her-2 positivity, and higher stage are all more common  in pregnant women.",B. Her-2 positivity is more common in pregnant women.,B.

Which of the follow- ing is NOT a component of the seven elements for  communicating bad news (P-SPIKES approach)? A. Assess the familyâ€™s perception of her current illness  and the status of her underlying cancer diagnosis. B. Empathize with the familyâ€™s feelings and provide  emotional support. C. Prepare mentally for the discussion. D. Provide an appropriate setting for discussion. E. Schedule a follow-up meeting in 1 day to reas- sess whether there are additional informational and  emotional needs.","The answer is E. (Chap. 32) Communication of bad news is an inher- ent component of the physicianâ€“patient relationship,  and these conversations often occur in a hospital set- ting where the treating provider is not the primary  care provider for the patient. Many physicians struggle  with providing clear and effective communication to  patients who are seriously ill and their family members.  In the scenario presented in this case, it is necessary  to have a discussion about the patientâ€™s poor prognosis  and determine the goals of care without the input of  the patient because her mental status remains altered.  Failure to provide clear communication in the appro- priate environment can lead to tension in the relation- ship between the physician and patient and may lead to  overly aggressive treatment. The P-SPIKES approach  (Table 32-2) has been advocated as a simple framework  to assist physicians in effectively communicating bad  news to patients. The components of this communica- tion tool are:  Review and Self-Assessment 776 â€¢  Preparationâ€”Review what information needs to  be communicated and plan how emotional support  will be provided. â€¢  Setting of interactionâ€”This step is often the most  neglected. Ensure a quiet and private environment  and attempt to minimize any interruptions. â€¢  Patient (or family) perceptions and  preparationâ€” Assess what the patient and family know about the  current condition. Use open-ended questions. â€¢  Invitation and information needsâ€”Ask the patient  or family what they would like to know and also  what limits they want regarding bad information â€¢  Knowledge of the conditionâ€”Provide the patient  and family with the bad news and assess under- standing. â€¢  Empathy and explorationâ€”Empathize with the  patient and familyâ€™s feelings and offer  emotional  support. Allow plenty of time for questions and  exploration of their feelings. â€¢  Summary and planningâ€”Outline the next steps for  the patient and family. Recommend a timeline to  achieve the goals of care. Setting a follow-up meeting is not a primary component  of the P-SPIKES framework but may be necessary when  a family or patient is not emotionally ready to discuss the  next steps in the care plan.","C. Prepare mentally for the discussion. 

This is not a component of the P-SPIKES approach for communicating bad news. The P-SPIKES approach includes: 
- Setting up the interview (Prepare, Arrange, Introduce)
- Assessing the patient's Perception
- Obtaining the patient's Invitation to give information
- Giving the patient Knowledge and information
- Addressing the patient's Emotions with empathetic responses
- Strategy and Summary (Discuss treatment options and plan)
- Support and follow-up (Provide support and schedule follow-up)",C. Prepare mentally for the discussion.
85,Which of the following is not a component of a  living will? A. Delineation of specific interventions that would be  acceptable to the patient under certain conditions B. Description of values that should guide discussions  regarding terminal care C. Designation of a health care proxy D. General statements regarding whether the patient  desires receipt of life-sustaining interventions such as  mechanical ventilation,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 32) Advance care planning documentation is an  increasing component of medical practice. As of 2006,  48 states and the District of Columbia had enacted leg- islation regarding advance care planning. The two broad  types of advance care planning documentation are living  wills and designation of a health care proxy (option C).  Although these two documents are often combined into  a single document, designation of a health care proxy  is not one of the primary components of a living will.  The living will (or instructional directive) delineates  the patientâ€™s preferences (option A) regarding treat- ment under different scenarios (e.g., whether condition  is perceived as terminal). These documents can be very  specific to a condition such as cancer but may also be  very broad in the case of elderly individuals who do not  currently have a terminal condition but want to outline  their wishes for care in the event of an unexpected health  crisis. Examples of what this might include general state- ments regarding the receipt of life-sustaining therapies  (option D) and the values that should guide the decisions  regarding terminal care (option B).",B.

86,"A 72-year-old woman has stage IV ovarian cancer  with diffuse peritoneal studding. She is develop- ing increasing pain in her abdomen and is admit- ted to the hospital for pain control. She previously  was treated with oxycodone 10 mg orally every   6 hours as needed. Upon admission, she is initiated  on morphine intravenously via patient-controlled  analgesia. During the first 48 hours of her hospi- talization, she received an average daily dose of  morphine 90 mg and reports adequate pain control  unless she is walking. What is the most appropriate  opioid  regimen for transitioning this patient to oral  pain medication?","The answer is C.  (Chap. 32) A primary goal of palliative care medicine is  to control pain in patients who are terminally ill. Surveys  have found that 36â€“90% of individuals with advanced  cancer have substantial pain, and an individualized   treatment plan is necessary for each patient. For individ- uals with continuous pain, opioid analgesics should be  administered on a scheduled basis around the clock at an  interval based on the half-life of the medication chosen.  Extended-release preparations are frequently used because  of their longer half-lives. However, it is inappropriate to  start immediately with an extended-release preparation.  In this scenario, the patient was treated with a continu- ous intravenous infusion via patient-controlled analgesia  for 48 hours to determine her baseline opioid needs. The  average daily dose of morphine required was 90 mg. This  total dose should be administered in divided doses two or  three times daily (either 45 mg twice daily or 30 mg three  times daily). In addition, an immediate-release preparation  should be available for administration for breakthrough  pain. The recommended dose of the immediate-release  preparation is 20% of the baseline dose. In this case, the  dose would be 18 mg and could be given as either 15 or  20 mg four times daily as needed.","The most appropriate opioid regimen for transitioning this patient to oral pain medication would be to switch her from intravenous morphine to an equivalent dose of oral morphine. Since she was receiving an average daily dose of 90 mg of morphine intravenously, she can be switched to an equivalent dose of oral morphine. 

The conversion ratio from intravenous to oral morphine is typically 3:1, meaning that 1 mg of intravenous morphine is equivalent to 3 mg of oral morphine. Therefore, the patient can be started on oral morphine at a dose of 30 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain control. 

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of inadequate pain control or opioid-related side effects when transitioning from intravenous to oral opioids. Additionally, the patient may benefit from the addition of adjuvant medications such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for additional pain relief.","Repeat: The most appropriate opioid regimen for transitioning this patient to oral pain medication would be to start her on an oral morphine regimen equivalent to the intravenous morphine she was receiving. Based on the average daily dose of morphine she received intravenously (90 mg), an equivalent oral dose can be calculated to provide adequate pain control."

On bone  scan images, there was evidence of widespread  bony metastases. He has been started on radiation  and hormonal therapy, and his disease has shown  some response. However, he has become quite  depressed since the metastatic disease was found.

What is the best approach to treating this patientâ€™s  depression? A. Do not initiate pharmacologic therapy because the  patient is experiencing an appropriate reaction to his  newly diagnosed metastatic disease. B. Initiate therapy with doxepin 75 mg nightly. C. Initiate therapy with fluoxetine 10 mg daily. D. Initiate therapy with fluoxetine 10 mg daily and  methylphenidate 2.5 mg twice daily in the morning  and at noon. E. Initiate therapy with methylphenidate 2.5 mg twice  daily in the morning and at noon.","The answer is D.  (Chap. 32) Depression is difficult to diagnose in indi- viduals with terminal illness and is often an overlooked  symptom by physicians because many individual believe  it a normal component of terminal illness. Further- more, symptoms commonly associated with depression  such as insomnia and anorexia are also frequently seen  in serious illness or occur as a side effect of treatment.  Although about 75% of terminally ill patients express  some depressive symptoms, only 25% or fewer have major  depression. When assessing depression in terminally ill  individuals, one should focus on symptoms pertaining  to the dysphoric mood, including helplessness, hope- lessness, and anhedonia. It is inappropriate to do noth- ing in when one believes major depression is occurring  (option A). The approach to treatment should include  nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. The  pharmacologic approach to depression should be the  same in terminally ill individuals as in nonâ€“terminally   ill individuals. If an individual has a prognosis of several  months or longer, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (fluoxetine, paroxetine) or serotoninâ€“noradrenaline reup- take inhibitors (venlafaxine) are the preferred treatment  because of their efficacy and side effect profile. However,  these medications take several weeks to become effec- tive. Thus, starting fluoxetine alone (option C) is not  preferred. In patients with major depression and fatigue  or opioid-induced somnolence, combining a traditional  antidepressant with a psychostimulant is appropriate  (option D). Psychostimulants are also indicated in indi- viduals with a poor prognosis who are not expected to  live long enough to experience the benefits of treat- ment with a traditional antidepressant. A variety of  psychostimulant medications are available, including  methylphenidate, modafinil, dextroamphetamine, and  pemoline. Because this patient has a prognosis of several   Review and Self-Assessment 777 months or longer, methylphenidate alone is not recom- mended (option E). Because of their side effect profile,  tricyclic antidepressants (option A) are not used in the  treatment of depression in terminally ill patients unless  they are used as adjunctive treatment for chronic pain.","D. Initiate therapy with fluoxetine 10 mg daily and methylphenidate 2.5 mg twice daily in the morning and at noon.

This patient is exhibiting symptoms of major depressive disorder, which is common in patients with advanced cancer. The combination of an antidepressant such as fluoxetine and a stimulant such as methylphenidate can help improve mood, energy levels, and overall functioning in patients with cancer-related depression. It is important to address the depression in order to improve the patient's quality of life and ability to cope with his illness.",The best approach to treating this patient's depression would be to initiate therapy with fluoxetine 10 mg daily.

Which  of the following interventions may help with the  treatment of the patientâ€™s oral secretions? A. Increased infusion rate of fentanyl B. N-acetylcysteine nebulized C. Pilocarpine drops D. Placement of a nasal trumpet and oral airway to   allow easier access for aggressive suctioning E. Scopolamine patches","The answer is E.  (Chap. 32) Withdrawal of care is a common occurrence  in intensive care units. More than 90% of Americans die  without performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  When a family decides to withdraw care, the treating  care team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists  must work together to ensure that the dying process  will be comfortable for both the patient and the family.  Commonly, patients receive a combination of anxiolyt- ics and opioid analgesics. These medications also provide  relief of dyspnea in the dying patient. However, they  have little effect on oropharyngeal secretions (option A).  The accumulation of secretions in the oropharynx can  produce agitation, labored breathing, and noisy breath- ing that has been labeled the â€œdeath rattle.â€_x009d_ This can be  quite distressing to the family. Treatments for excessive  oropharyngeal secretions are primarily anticholinergic  medications, including scopolamine delivered transder- mally (option E) or intravenously, atropine, and glyco- pyrrolate.

Which of  the following is the best predictor of metastatic risk  in this patient? A. Breslow thickness B. Clark level C. Female gender D. Presence of ulceration E. Site of lesion","The answer is A.  (Chap. 33) The staging criteria for melanoma include the  thickness of the lesion, the presence of ulceration, and the  presence and number of involved lymph nodes. Of these,  the single best predictor of metastatic risk is the Breslow  thickness, particularly >4 mm, although the other factors  also provide additional predictive value. Other factors that  predict survival in melanoma are younger age, gender  with female sex predicting a better survival, and anatomic  site with favorable sites being the forearm and leg. The  Clark level defined melanoma based on the layer of skin to  which a melanoma had invaded, but this has been found  to be not predictive of metastatic risk.","A. Breslow thickness

Breslow thickness is the most important predictor of metastatic risk in melanoma. Thicker melanomas have a higher risk of spreading to other parts of the body. Other factors such as ulceration, mitotic rate, and presence of lymphovascular invasion also play a role in determining the risk of metastasis. Clark level refers to the depth of invasion of melanoma cells in the skin layers and is also important in determining prognosis. Gender and site of lesion are not as significant in predicting metastatic risk.",Breslow thickness
90,A 53-year-old man with a history of superficial  spreading melanoma is diagnosed with disease meta- static to the lungs and bones. Genetic testing confirms  the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation. What  do you recommend for treatment of this patient? A. Dacarbazine B. Hospice care C. Interleukin-2 D. Ipilimumab E. Vemurafenib,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 33, PB Chapman et al: N Engl J Med 2011;364:  2507â€“2516) Treatment of metastatic melanoma has largely  shown very little improvements on mortality in this dis- ease. The median survival time after diagnosis of metastatic  disease is typically 6 to 15 months. Until August 2011,  the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)â€“approved  chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic disease was  dacarbazine, although response rates are about 20% or less.  Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy has also been attempted alone  or in combination with interferon-Î±. This therapy has led  to long-term disease-free survival in about 5% of treated  patients but is associated with significant toxicity that  limits its usefulness. IL-2 should only be administered to  patients with good performance status and at centers expe- rienced in the treatment of IL-2 toxicity. Most recently in  August 2011, the FDA approved the drug vemurafenib  (PLX4032) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This  drug targets BRAF, which is a common mutation in mela- noma that results in constitutive activation of the mitogen- activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Vemurafenib has  specifically demonstrated to have the best activity against  the BRAF V600E mutation, the most common kinase  mutation in metastatic melanoma. Data published in 2011  demonstrated that individuals with this specific mutation  have response rates of 48% to the drug compared with  only 5% for dacarbazine. Furthermore, the 6-month sur- vival was rate 84% in the vemurafenib group compared  with only 64% in the dacarbazine group. Ipilimumab is  another promising new therapy for the treatment of meta- static melanoma. This treatment is a monoclonal antibody  that blocks cytotoxic T-cell antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and a  recent clinical trial demonstrated improved overall survival  rates in patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine  compared with dacarbazine alone (C Robert et al: N Engl  J Med 2011;364: 2517â€“25).","E. Vemurafenib

91,"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care phy- sician complaining of a hoarse voice for 6 months.  He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes daily and drinks at  least a six pack of beer daily. His physical examina- tion reveals a thin man with a weak voice in no  distress. No stridor is heard. The head and neck  examination is normal. No cervical lymphade- nopathy is present. He is referred to otolaryngol- ogy where a laryngeal lesion is discovered. Biopsy  reveals squamous cell carcinoma. On imaging, the  mass measures 2.8 cm. No suspicious lymphade- nopathy is present on PET imaging. What is the  best choice of therapy in this patient? A. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy B. Chemotherapy alone C. Radiation therapy alone D. Radical neck dissection alone E. Radical neck dissection followed by concomitant  chemotherapy and radiation","The answer is C.  (Chap. 34) Head and neck cancers account for about 3%  of all malignancies in the United States and comprise a  varied site of tumors, including those of the nasophar- ynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Squamous  cell history is the predominant cell type at all sites, but  there are different risk factors by site. Nasopharyngeal  cancers are rare in the United States but are endemic in  the Mediterranean and Far East, where they are asso- ciated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Oropharyn- geal cancers are associated with tobacco use, especially  smokeless tobacco, and increasing numbers of oropha- ryngeal cancers are found to be associated with human  papilloma virus (HPV). The association with HPV virus  infection, particularly serotypes 16 and 18, characterizes  these oropharyngeal cancers as a form of sexually trans- mitted disease and is associated with oral sexual practices  and an increased number of sexual partners. However,  the predominant risk factors for head and neck cancers,  particularly those of the hypopharynx and larynx, are  alcohol and tobacco use. Cancers of the larynx often  present with the subacute onset of hoarseness that does  not resolve over time, but symptoms of head and neck  cancer can be rather nonspecific. In more advanced  cases, pain, stridor, dysphagia, odynophagia, and cra- nial neuropathies can occur. Diagnosis of head and neck   cancer should include computed tomography of the head   Review and Self-Assessment 778 and neck and endoscopic examination under anesthesia  to perform biopsies. Positron emission tomography scans  may be used as adjunctive therapy. The staging of head  and neck cancers follows a TNM (tumor, node, metas- tasis) staging guideline. This patient would be staged as  T2N0M0 based on a tumor size without evidence of  lymph node involvement or distant metastatic disease.  With this designation, the patientâ€™s overall stage would  be stage II and classified as localized disease. The intent  of therapy at this stage of disease is cure of cancer, and  the overall 5-year survival is 60â€“90%. The choice of  therapy for laryngeal cancer is radiation therapy to pre- serve the voice. Surgical therapy could be chosen by the  patient as well but is less desirable. In locally or regionally  advanced disease, patients can still be approached with  curative intent, but this requires multimodality therapy  with surgery followed by concomitant chemotherapy  and radiation treatment.","A. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy

Given the size of the laryngeal lesion and the presence of squamous cell carcinoma, the best choice of therapy in this patient would be concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This combination therapy has been shown to be effective in treating laryngeal cancer and can help improve outcomes for the patient. Additionally, the lack of suspicious lymphadenopathy on imaging suggests that the cancer may be localized, making this combination therapy a suitable option.",A.

92,Which of the following statements is true with  regard to the solitary pulmonary nodule? A. A lobulated and irregular contour is more indicative  of malignancy than a smooth one. B. About 80% of incidentally found pulmonary nodules  are benign.  Review and Self-Assessment 743 C. Absence of growth over a period of 6 to 12 months  is sufficient to determine if a solitary pulmonary  nodule is benign. D. Ground-glass nodules should be regarded as benign. E. Multiple nodules indicate malignant disease.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 35) Solitary pulmonary nodules are frequent  causes of referral to a pulmonologist, but most solitary  pulmonary nodules are benign. In fact, >90% of inci- dentally identified nodules are of benign origin. Features  that are more likely to be present in a malignant lesion  are size larger than 3 cm, eccentric calcification, rapid  doubling time, and lobulated and irregular contour.  Ground-glass appearance on computed tomography can  be either malignant or benign. Among malignant lesions,  it is seen more commonly in bronchoalveolar cell car- cinoma. When multiple pulmonary nodules are identi- fied, it most commonly represents prior granulomatous  disease from healed infections. If multiple nodules are  malignant in origin, it usually indicates disease metastatic  to the lung but can be simultaneous lung primary lesions  or lesions metastatic from a primary lung cancer. Many  incidentally identified nodules are too small to be diag- nosed by biopsy and are nonspecific in nature. In this  situation, it is prudent to follow the lesions for 2 years,  especially in a patient who is high risk for lung cancer  to allow for a proper doubling time to occur. If the  lesion remains stable for 2 years, it is most likely benign,  although some slow-growing tumors such bronchoal- veolar cell carcinoma can have a slower growth rate.",B. About 80% of incidentally found pulmonary nodules are benign.,B. About 80% of incidentally found pulmonary nodules are benign.
93,"A 64-year-old man seeks evaluation for a solitary pul- monary nodule that was found incidentally. He had  presented to the emergency department for short- ness of breath and chest tightness. A CT pulmonary  angiogram did not show any evidence of pulmo- nary embolism. However, a 9-mm nodule is seen  in the periphery of the left lower lobe. No enlarged  mediastinal lymph nodes are present. He is a current  smoker of 2 packs of cigarettes daily and has done  so since the 16 years of age. He generally reports no  functional limitation related to respiratory symp- toms. His FEV1 is 88% predicted, FVC is 92% pre- dicted, and diffusion capacity is 80% predicted. He  previously had normal chest radiography findings  3 years previously. What is the next best step in the  evaluation and treatment of this patient? A. Perform a bronchoscopy with biopsy for diagnosis. B. Perform a combined PET and CT to assess for uptake  in the nodule and assess for lymph node metastases. C. Perform a follow-up CT scan in 3 months to assess  for interval growth. D. Refer the patient to radiation oncology for stereo- tactic radiation of the dominant nodule. E. Refer the patient to thoracic surgery for video- assisted thoracoscopic biopsy and resection of lung  nodule if malignancy is diagnosed.","The answer is E.  (Chap. 35) The evaluation and treatment of solitary pulmo- nary nodules is important to understand. This patient has a  long smoking history with a new nodule that was not appar- ent by chest radiography 3 years previously. This should be  assumed to be a malignant nodule, and definitive diagnosis  and treatment should be attempted. The option for diag- nostic and staging procedures include positron emission  tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT),  bronchoscopic biopsy, percutaneous needle biopsy, and  surgical biopsy with concomitant resection if positive.  PET and CT would be low yield in this patient given the  small size of the primary lesion (<1 cm) and the lack of  enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Likewise, bronchos- copy would not provide a good yield because the lesion  is very peripheral in origin, and a negative biopsy result  for malignancy would not be definitive. Appropriate  approaches would be to either perform a percutaneous  needle biopsy with CT guidance or perform a surgical  biopsy with definitive resection if positive. Because this  patient has preserved lung function, surgical biopsy and  resection is a good treatment option. A repeat CT scan  assessing for interval growth would only be appropriate if  the patient declined further workup at this time. Referral  for treatment with radiation therapy is not appropriate in  the absence of tissue diagnosis of malignancy, and surgical  resection is the preferred primary treatment because the  patient has no contraindications to surgical intervention.","B. Perform a combined PET and CT to assess for uptake in the nodule and assess for lymph node metastases.

Given the patient's history of smoking and the presence of a solitary pulmonary nodule, further evaluation with a combined PET and CT scan is recommended to assess for metabolic activity in the nodule and to evaluate for any potential lymph node involvement. This will help determine the likelihood of malignancy and guide further management.",Perform a combined PET and CT to assess for uptake in the nodule and assess for lymph node metastases.
94,"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency  department complaining of a droopy right eye and  blurred vision for the past day. The symptoms started  abruptly, and he denies any antecedent illness. For the  past 4 months, he has been complaining of increasing  pain in his right arm and shoulder. His primary care  physician has treated him for shoulder bursitis with- out relief. His medical history is significant for COPD  and hypertension. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes  daily. He has chronic daily sputum production and  has stable dyspnea on exertion. On physical exami- nation, he has right eye ptosis with unequal pupils.  On the right, his pupil is 2 mm and not reactive; on  the left, the pupil is 4 mm and reactive. However,  his ocular movements appear intact. His lung fields  are clear to auscultation. On extremity examination,  there is wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.  Which of the following would be most likely to  explain the patientâ€™s constellation of symptoms? A. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes causing occlusion  of the superior vena cava B. Metastases to the midbrain from small cell lung  cancer C. Paraneoplastic syndrome caused by antibodies to  voltage-gated calcium channels D. Presence of a cervical rib on chest radiography E. Right apical pleural thickening with a mass-like  density measuring 1 cm in thickness","The answer is E.  (Chap. 35) Pancoast syndrome results from apical exten- sion of a lung mass into the brachial plexus with frequent  involvement of the eighth cervical and first and second  thoracic nerves. As the tumor continues to grow, it will  also involve the sympathetic ganglia of the thoracic chain.  The clinical manifestations of a Pancoast tumor include  shoulder and arm pain and Hornerâ€™s syndrome (ipsilateral  ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis). Often, the shoulder and  arm pain presents several months before diagnosis. The  most common cause of Pancoast syndrome is an apical  lung tumor, usually nonâ€“small cell lung cancer. Other  causes include mesothelioma and infection, among others.  Although midbrain lesions can cause Hornerâ€™s syndrome,  other cranial nerve abnormalities would be expected.  Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and masses in the  middle mediastinum can occlude the superior vena cava  (SVC), leading to SVC syndrome. Individuals with  SVC syndrome typically present with dyspnea and have  evidence of facial and upper extremity swelling. Eaton  Lambert myasthenic syndrome is caused by antibodies  to voltage-gated calcium channels and is characterized  by generalized weakness of muscles that increases with  repetitive nerve stimulation. Cervical ribs can cause  thoracic outlet syndrome by compression of nerves or  vasculature as they exit the chest. This typically pres- ents with ischemic symptoms to the affected limb, but  intrinsic wasting of the muscles of the hand can be seen  because of neurologic compromise.","B. Metastases to the midbrain from small cell lung cancer

This patient's symptoms of droopy right eye, unequal pupils, and right arm and shoulder pain are consistent with Horner syndrome, which can be caused by metastases to the midbrain from small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is known to have a high propensity for metastasis to the brain and can present with neurological symptoms such as Horner syndrome. The other answer choices are less likely to explain the patient's symptoms.",Metastases to the midbrain from small cell lung cancer would be most likely to explain the patient's constellation of symptoms.
95,A 55-year-old man presents with superior vena  cava syndrome and is diagnosed with small cell lung  cancer. Which of the following tests are indicated  to properly stage this patient? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. CT scan of the abdomen C. CT or MRI of the brain with intravenous contrast D. Lumbar puncture E. B and C F. All of the above,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 35) At the time of diagnosis, 70% of small cell  lung cancers have metastasized. In contrast to nonâ€“small  cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer is staged as lim- ited or extensive disease based on the spread of disease in  the body rather than size of the tumor burden or extent  of lymph node involvement. Common sites of metasta- ses in small cell lung cancer are thoracic lymph nodes,  brain, adrenal glands, and liver. All patients diagnosed  with small cell lung cancer should undergo chest and   Review and Self-Assessment 779 abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans as well as  CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging of  the brain. If bone pain is present, radionuclide bone scans  should be performed. Bone marrow biopsies are not typ- ically indicated as isolated bone marrow metastases are  rare. If there are signs of spinal cord compression or lep- tomeningeal involvement, imaging of the spine by MRI  or CT and lumbar puncture are indicated, respectively.","F. All of the above

Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive type of lung cancer that often spreads quickly to other parts of the body. Proper staging is important to determine the extent of the disease and guide treatment decisions. 

A bone marrow biopsy may be indicated to assess for any spread of cancer to the bone marrow. A CT scan of the abdomen can help determine if the cancer has spread to the liver, adrenal glands, or other abdominal organs. 

CT or MRI of the brain with intravenous contrast is important to assess for any metastases to the brain, as small cell lung cancer has a high propensity to spread to the brain. 

A lumbar puncture may be indicated to assess for any spread of cancer to the cerebrospinal fluid. 

Therefore, all of the above tests are indicated to properly stage a patient with small cell lung cancer presenting with superior vena cava syndrome.",F. All of the above

A 76-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma  and a history of asbestos exposure","The answer is C.  (Chap. 35) Mutations of the epidermal growth fac- tor receptor (EGF-R) have recently been recognized  as important mutations that affect the response of  nonâ€“small cell lung cancers to treatment with EGF-R  tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Initial studies of erlotinib in  all patients with advanced nonâ€“small cell lung cancer  failed to show a treatment benefit; however, when only  patients with EGF-R mutations were considered, treat- ment with anti-EGF-R therapy improved progression- free and overall survival. Patients who are more likely to   have EGF-R mutations are women, nonsmokers, Asians,  and those with adenocarcinoma histopathology.","C. A 45-year-old woman who has never smoked with an adenocarcinoma

EGFR mutations are more commonly found in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, particularly in those with adenocarcinoma histology and who have never smoked. Therefore, the 45-year-old woman who has never smoked with an adenocarcinoma is most likely to have an EGFR mutation.",C. A 45-year-old woman who has never smoked with an adenocarcinoma
97,"Given that most individuals with lung cancer pres- ent with advanced disease and have a high mortality  rate, much research has investigated methods for  early detection of lung cancer. Which of the fol- lowing approaches is most likely to impact disease- related mortality from lung cancer? A. Carefully design and implement low-dose chest  CT screening in individuals with >30 pack years of  cigarette smoking. B. Continue annual screening with chest radiography  for individuals with >30 pack years of cigarette  smoking C. Do not recommend any screening because 30 years  of research has not demonstrated any effect on mor- tality from lung cancer.  Review and Self-Assessment 744 D. Offer screening with low-dose CTs to all current or  former smokers. E. Offer screening with combined PET and CT to indi- viduals with >30 pack years of tobacco use.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 35, National Lung Screening Trial Research Team,  DR Aberle et al: N Engl J Med 2011;365: 395â€“409)  Screening for lung cancer in high-risk individuals has  been investigated for many years. Screening trials require  large numbers of participants that can be followed for  long periods of time and are expensive to conduct. Until  2011, no screening trial had been able to demonstrate  any decrease in lung cancer mortality. Previous screening  modalities have been primarily chest radiographs with or  without sputum cytology. In June 2011, the main results  of the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST)  were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The trial enrolled >50,000 individuals with a >30 pack- year history of cigarette smoking and randomized the  individuals to yearly chest radiographs or low-dose com- puted tomography (CT) scans for a period of 3 years.  Outcomes in the individuals continued to be followed  for a total of almost 8 years, when the trial was stopped  early. Individuals receiving low-dose CT scans demon- strated a 20% mortality reduction from lung cancer com- pared with those receiving chest radiographs alone, and  more individuals receiving CT scans were diagnosed at  early stages of disease. A caveat in broadly applying these  results in clinical practice is that >90% of positive scans  proved to be false positives. At this point, more research  on the cost effectiveness of CT scans and the appropri- ate population to which to offer scans needs to be done  before widespread screening is recommended.","A. Carefully design and implement low-dose chest CT screening in individuals with >30 pack years of cigarette smoking.

This approach is most likely to impact disease-related mortality from lung cancer as low-dose chest CT screening has been shown to be effective in detecting lung cancer at an early stage when it is more treatable. This approach targets individuals at high risk for lung cancer due to their smoking history and has the potential to detect lung cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage, ultimately reducing mortality rates.",A. Carefully design and implement low-dose chest CT screening in individuals with >30 pack years of cigarette smoking.
98,All of the following conditions may be associated  with a thymoma EXCEPT: A. Erythrocytosis B. Hypogammaglobulinemia C. Myasthenia gravis D. Polymyositis E. Pure red blood cell aplasia,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 36) About 40% of patients with thymoma  have another systemic autoimmune illness related to  the thymoma. About 30% of patients with thymoma  have myasthenia gravis, 5â€“8% have pure red blood cell  (RBC) aplasia, and about 5% have hypogammaglobu- linemia. Thymectomy results in the resolution of pure  RBC aplasia in about 30% of patients but rarely benefits  patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Among patients  with myasthenia gravis, about 10â€“15% have a thymoma.  Thymectomy produces at least some symptomatic  improvement in about 65% of patients with myasthe- nia gravis. In one large series, thymoma patients with  myasthenia gravis had a better long-term survival from  thymoma resection than did those without myasthenia  gravis. Thymoma more rarely may be associated with  polymyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis,  SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pernicious ane- mia, Addisonâ€™s disease, scleroderma, and panhypopitu- itarism.

The cough is  nonproductive and present throughout the day and  night. It worsens when lying on her back. She has  also noticed some upper chest pain and dyspnea  on exertion for the past week. A chest radiograph  shows a large mass (>5 cm) confined to the anterior  mediastinum. Which of the following diagnoses is  most likely? A. Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma B. Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma C. Teratoma D. Thymoma E. Thyroid carcinoma,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 36) Thymoma is the most common cause of an  anterior mediastinal mass in adults, accounting for about  40% of all mediastinal masses. The other major causes  of anterior mediastinal masses are lymphomas, germ  cell tumors, and substernal thyroid tumors. Carcinoid  tumors, lipomas, and thymic cysts also may produce  radiographic masses. After combination chemotherapy  for another malignancy, teenagers and young adults  may develop a rebound thymic hyperplasia in the first  few months after treatment. Granulomatous inflam- matory diseases (tuberculosis, sarcoidosis) can produce  thymic enlargement. Thymomas are most common in  the fifth and sixth decades of life, are uncommon in  children, and are distributed evenly between men and  women. About 40â€“50% of patients are asymptomatic;  masses are detected incidentally on routine chest radio- graphs. When symptomatic, patients may have cough,  chest pain, dyspnea, fever, wheezing, fatigue, weight  loss, night sweats, or anorexia. Occasionally, thymomas  may obstruct the superior vena cava. After a mediastinal  mass has been detected, a surgical procedure is required  for definitive diagnosis. An initial mediastinoscopy or  limited thoracotomy can be undertaken to get suffi- cient tissue to make an accurate diagnosis. Fine-needle  aspiration is poor at distinguishing between lympho- mas and thymomas but is more reliable in diagnosing  germ cell tumors and metastatic carcinoma. Thymomas  and lymphomas require sufficient tissue to examine the  tumor architecture to ensure an accurate diagnosis and  obtain prognostic information. Thymomas are epithelial  tumors, and all of them have malignant potential. It is  not worthwhile to try to divide them into benign and  malignant forms. Staging systems are based on degree of  invasiveness and correlate with prognosis. About 65% of  thymomas are encapsulated and noninvasive, and about    Review and Self-Assessment 780 35% are invasive. Tumors that are encapsulated and  noninvasive (stage 1) have a 96% 5-year survival rate  after complete resection surgery.","D. Thymoma

Thymomas are tumors that arise from the thymus gland in the anterior mediastinum. They can present with symptoms such as cough, chest pain, and dyspnea. The fact that the mass is confined to the anterior mediastinum and the patient's symptoms are consistent with thymoma make this the most likely diagnosis.",D. Thymoma

Metastatic carcinoma infiltration D. Myelofibrosis E. Normal bone marrow,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 36) A â€œdry tapâ€_x009d_ is defined as the inability to aspi- rate bone marrow and is reported in approximately 5% of  attempts. It is rare in the case of normal bone marrow. The  differential diagnosis includes metastatic carcinoma infil- tration (17%); chronic myeloid leukemia (15%); myelo- fibrosis (14%); hairy cell leukemia (10%); acute leukemia  (10%); and lymphomas, including Hodgkinâ€™s disease (9%).","D.

It is not necessary to have increased circulating  eosinophils. C. Primary myeloid leukemia must be excluded. D. Reactive eosinophilia (e.g., parasitic infection,   allergy, collagen vascular disease) must be excluded. E. There must be <20% myeloblasts in blood or bone  marrow.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 36) The diagnostic criteria for chronic eosino- philic leukemia and the hypereosinophilic syndrome  first requires the presence of persistent eosinophilia  >1500/Î¼L in blood, increased marrow eosinophils, and  <20% myeloblasts in blood or marrow. Additional dis- orders that must be excluded include all causes of reac- tive eosinophilia, primary neoplasms associated with  eosinophilia (e.g., T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkinâ€™s dis- ease, acute lymphoid leukemia, mastocytosis, chronic  myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia [AML],  myelodysplasia, and myeloproliferative syndromes), and  T-cell reaction with increased interleukin-5 or cytokine  production. If these entities have been excluded and the  myeloid cells show a clonal chromosome abnormality  and blast cells (>2%) are present in peripheral blood or  are increased in marrow (but <20%), then the diagnosis  is chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Patients with hypereo- sinophilic syndrome and chronic eosinophilic leukemia  may be asymptomatic (discovered on routine testing) or  present with systemic findings such as fever, shortness  of breath, new neurologic findings, or rheumatologic  findings.

There is no axillary  lymphadenopathy present. The contralateral breast  is normal. The breast is reexamined in 3 weeks, and  the same findings are present. The cyst is aspirated,  and clear fluid is removed. The mass is no longer  palpable. Which of the following statements is true? A. Breast MRI should be obtained to discern for   residual fluid collection. B. Mammography is required to further evaluate the  lesion. C. She should be evaluated in 1 month for recurrence. D. She should be referred to a breast surgeon for   resection. E. She should not breastfeed any more children.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 37) The patient has a breast cyst. This has a  benign feel on examination, and aspiration of the mass  showed nonbloody fluid with resolution of the mass. If  there were residual mass or bloody fluid, mammography  and biopsy would be the next step. In patients such as  this with nonbloody fluid in whom aspiration clears the  mass, reexamination in 1 month is indicated. If the mass  recurs, then aspiration should be repeated. If fluid recurs,  mammography and biopsy would be indicated at that  point. There is no indication at this point to refer for  advanced imaging or surgical evaluation. Breastfeeding  is not affected by the presence of a breast cyst.","C. She should be evaluated in 1 month for recurrence.

Since the mass was aspirated and clear fluid was removed, it is likely a benign cyst. The fact that the mass is no longer palpable after aspiration is a good sign. However, it is important to follow up in 1 month to ensure that the mass does not recur. Breast MRI or mammography may be considered if there are any concerning findings on follow-up examination. Referral to a breast surgeon for resection is not necessary at this time. There is no indication that she should not breastfeed any more children.",B.

(Chap. 37) Breast cancer risk is related to many factors,  but age of menarche, age of first full-term pregnancy,  and age at menopause together account for 70â€“80% of  all breast cancer risk. The lowest risk patients have the  shortest duration of total menses (i.e., later menarche  and earlier menopause), as well as an early first full-term  pregnancy. Specifically, the lowest risks are menarche at  age 16 years old or older, first pregnancy by the age of  18 years, and menopause that begins 10 years before the  median age of menopause of 52 years. Thus, patient C  meets these criteria.","C. A woman with menarche at 16 years, first child at 17 years, and menopause at 42 years

104,Which of the following tumor characteristics con- fers a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer? A. Estrogen receptor positive B. Good nuclear grade C. Low proportion of cells in S-phase D. Overexpression of erbB2 (HER-2/neu) E. Progesterone receptor positive,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 37) Pathologic staging remains the most impor- tant determinant of overall prognosis. Other prognos- tic factors have an impact on survival and the choice  of therapy. Tumors that lack estrogen or progesterone  receptors are more likely to recur. The presence of estro- gen receptors, particularly in postmenopausal women, is  also an important factor in determining adjuvant chemo- therapy. Tumors with a high growth rate are associated  with early relapse. Measurement of the proportion of  cells in S-phase is a measure of the growth rate. Tumors  with more than the median number of cells in S-phase  have a higher risk of relapse and an improved response  rate to chemotherapy. Histologically, tumors with a  poor nuclear grade have a higher risk of recurrence than  do tumors with a good nuclear grade. At the molecular  level, tumors that overexpress erbB2 (HER-2/neu) or  that have a mutated p53 gene portend a poorer prog- nosis for patients. The overexpression of erbB2 is also  useful in designing optimal treatment regimens, and a  human monoclonal antibody to erbB2 (Herceptin) has  been developed.",D.

On physical examina- tion, the patient appears cachectic with temporal  wasting. He has a body mass index of 19.4 kg/m2.  His blood pressure is 198/110 mm Hg, heart rate  is 110 beats/min, respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min,  temperature is 37.4Â°C (99.2Â°F), and oxygen satura- tion is 93% on room air. His pulmonary examina- tion shows decreased breath sounds at the apices  with scattered expiratory wheezes. His cardiovas- cular examination demonstrates an S4 gallop with  a hyperdynamic precordium. A regular tachycardia  is present. Blood pressures are equal in both arms.  Liver span is not enlarged. There are no palpable  abdominal masses. What is the most likely cause of  the patientâ€™s presentation? A. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus B. Ascending aortic aneurysm C. Esophageal stricture D. Gastric cancer E. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus","The answer is E. (Chap. 38) Esophageal cancer is an uncommon gastro- intestinal malignancy with a high mortality rate because  most patients do not present until advanced disease is  present. The typical presenting symptoms of esopha- geal cancer are dysphagia with significant weight loss.  Dysphagia is typically fairly rapidly progressive over a  period of weeks to months. Dysphagia initially in only  to solid foods but progresses to include semisolids and  liquids. For dysphagia to occur, an estimated 60% of  the esophageal lumen must be occluded. Weight loss  occurs because of decreased oral intake in addition to  the cachexia that is common with cancer. Associated  symptoms may include pain with swallowing that can  radiate to the back, regurgitation or vomiting of undi- gested food, and aspiration pneumonia. The two major  cell types of esophageal cancer in the United States are  adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which  have different risk factors. Individuals with squamous  cell carcinomas typically have a history of both tobacco  and alcohol abuse, but those with adenocarcinoma more  often have a history of long-standing gastroesophageal  reflux disease and Barrettâ€™s esophagitis. Among those   Review and Self-Assessment 781 with a history of alcohol and tobacco abuse, there is an  increased risk with increased intake and interestingly is  more associated with whiskey drinking compared with  wine or beer. Other risk factors for squamous cell car- cinoma of the esophagus include ingestion of nitrites,  smoked opiates, fungal toxins in pickled vegetables, and  physical insults that include long-standing ingestion of  very hot tea or lye.","E. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus

Given the patient's symptoms of dysphagia, weight loss, and regurgitation of undigested food, along with his history of heavy alcohol and tobacco use, the most likely cause of his presentation is squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. This type of cancer is strongly associated with alcohol and tobacco use. Other possible causes, such as adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastric cancer, are less likely based on the patient's presentation and risk factors.",The most likely cause of the patient's presentation is option C: Esophageal stricture.
106,"A 64-year-old woman presents with complaints  of a change in stool caliber for the past 2 months.  The stools now have a diameter of only the size  of her fifth digit. Over this same period, she feels  she has to exert increasing strain to have a bowel  movement and sometimes has associated abdominal  cramping. She often has blood on the toilet paper  when she wipes. During this time, she has lost about  20 lb. On physical examination, the patient appears  cachectic with a body mass index of 22.5 kg/m2.  The abdomen is flat and nontender. The liver span  is 12 cm to percussion. On digital rectal examina- tion, a mass lesion is palpated approximately 8 cm  into the rectum. A colonoscopy is attempted, which  demonstrates a 2.5-cm sessile mass that narrows the  colonic lumen. The biopsy confirms adenocarci- noma. The colonoscope is not able to traverse the  mass. A CT scan of the abdomen does not show  evidence of metastatic disease. Liver function test  results are normal. A carcinoembryonic antigen  level is 4.2 ng/mL. The patient is referred for sur- gery and undergoes rectosigmoidectomy with pel- vic lymph node dissection. Final pathology dem- onstrates extension of the primary tumor into the  muscularis propria but not the serosa. Of 15 lymph  nodes removed, two are positive for tumor. What  do you recommend for this patient after surgery? A. Chemotherapy with a regimen containing   5-fluorouracil B. Complete colonoscopy within 3 months C. Measurement of CEA levels at 3-month intervals D. Radiation therapy to the pelvis E. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 38) Colorectal cancer is the second most com- mon cause of cancer death in the United States, and the  mortality rate related to the disease has been decreas- ing in recent years. When colorectal cancer is identi- fied, patients should be referred for surgical intervention  because proper staging and prognosis cannot be deter- mined without pathologic specimens if there is no gross  evidence of metastatic disease. The preoperative workup  to assess for metastatic or synchronous disease includes a  complete colonoscopy if possible, chest radiography, liver  function testing, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test- ing, and computed tomography of the abdomen. Stag- ing of colorectal cancer follows a TNM (tumor, node,  metastasis) staging system. However, the T staging is not  based on absolute size of the tumor rather it is based upon  the extension of the tumor through the colonic wall. T1  tumors can extend into the submucosa but not beyond,  T2 tumors extend into the muscularis propria, and T3  tumors involve the serosa and beyond. Nodal metastases  are graded as N1 (one to three lymph nodes positive)  and N2 (â‰¥four lymph nodes positive). This patientâ€™s stage  of cancer would be T2N1M0 and would be staged as a  stage III cancer. Despite the relatively advanced stage, the  overall 5-year survival rate would be 50â€“70% because of  improvements in overall care of the patient with colorec- tal cancer. Because the patient had an occluding lesion  that prevents preoperative colonoscopy, the patient  needs to have a complete colonoscopy performed within  the first several months after surgery and every 3 years  thereafter. Serial measurements of CEA every 3 months  have also been advocated by some specialists. Annual  computed tomography may be performed for the first 3  years after resection, although the utility of the practice is  debated. Radiation therapy to the pelvis is recommended  for all patients with rectal cancer because it reduces the  local recurrence rate, especially in stage II and III tumors.  When postoperative radiation therapy is combined with  chemotherapeutic regimens containing 5-fluorouracil,  the local recurrence rate is further reduced and overall  survival is increased as well.","E. All of the above

After surgery, this patient should undergo chemotherapy with a regimen containing 5-fluorouracil to target any remaining cancer cells. Complete colonoscopy within 3 months is recommended to ensure there are no other lesions in the colon. Measurement of CEA levels at 3-month intervals can help monitor for recurrence of the cancer. Radiation therapy to the pelvis may also be considered depending on the extent of the disease and the risk of recurrence.",E. All of the above
107,"A healthy 62-year-old woman returns to your  clinic after undergoing routine colonoscopy. Find- ings included two 1.3-cm sessile (flat-based), vil- lous adenomas in her ascending colon that were  removed during the procedure. What is the next  step in management? A. Colonoscopy in 3 years B. Colonoscopy in 10 years C. CT scan of the abdomen D. Partial colectomy E. Reassurance","The answer is A.  (Chap. 38) Most colorectal cancers arise from adenoma- tous polyps. Only adenomas are premalignant, and only  a minority of these lesions becomes malignant. Most pol- yps are asymptomatic, causing occult bleeding in fewer  than 5% of patients. Sessile (flat-based) polyps are more  likely to become malignant than pedunculated (stalked)  polyps. Histologically, villous adenomas are more likely  to become malignant than tubular adenomas. The risk  of containing invasive carcinoma in the polyp increases  with size with <2% in polyps <1.5 cm, 2%â€“10% in pol- yps 1.5 to 2.5 cm, and 10% in polyps >2. 5 cm. This  patient had two polyps that were high risk based on his- tology (villous) and appearance (sessile) but only moder- ate risk by size (<1.5 cm). Polyps, particularly those larger  than 2.5 cm in size, sometimes contain cancer cells but  usually progress to cancer quite slowly over an approxi- mate 5-year period. Patients with adenomatous polyps  should have a follow-up colonoscopy or radiographic  study in 3 years. If no polyps are found on initial study,  the test (endoscopic or radiographic) should be repeated  in 10 years. Computed tomography is only warranted for  staging if there is a diagnosis of colon cancer, not for the  presence of polyps alone.","A. Colonoscopy in 3 years

Given the presence of two large villous adenomas, the patient is at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. Therefore, the next step in management would be to schedule a follow-up colonoscopy in 3 years to monitor for any recurrence or new polyps. This will help to ensure early detection and treatment if necessary.",Colonoscopy in 3 years
108,"Which of the following should prompt investi- gation for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer  screening in a 32-year-old man? A. Father, paternal aunt, and paternal cousin with colon  cancer with ages of diagnosis of 54, 68, and 37 years,  respectively B. Innumerable polyps visualized on routine   colonoscopy C. Mucocutaneous pigmentation D. New diagnosis of ulcerative colitis E. None of the above","The answer is A.  (Chap. 38) A strong family history of colon cancer should  prompt consideration for hereditary nonpolyposis colon  cancer (HNPCC), or Lynch syndrome, particularly if  diffuse polyposis is not noted on colonoscopy. HNPCC  is characterized by (1) three or more relatives with his- tologically proven colorectal cancer, one of whom is a  first-degree relative and of the other two, at least one  with the diagnosis before age 50 years, and (2) colorec- tal cancer in at least two generations. The disease is an  autosomal dominant trait and is associated with other  tumors, including in the endometrium and ovary. The  proximal colon is most frequently involved, and cancer  occurs with a median age of 50 years, 15 years earlier  than in sporadic colon cancer. Patients with HNPCC  are recommended to receive biennial colonoscopy and  pelvic ultrasonography beginning at age 25 years. Innu- merable polyps suggest the presence of one of the auto- somal dominant polyposis syndromes, many of which  carry a high malignant potential. These include familial  adenomatous polyposis, Gardnerâ€™s syndrome (associated  with osteomas, fibromas, epidermoid cysts), or Turcotâ€™s  syndrome (associated with brain cancer). Peutz-Jeghers  syndrome is associated with mucocutaneous pigmenta- tion and hamartomas. Tumors may develop in the ovary,  breast, pancreas, and endometrium; however, malignant  colon cancers are not common. Ulcerative colitis is  strongly associated with development of colon cancer,  but it is unusual for colon cancer to be the presenting  finding in ulcerative colitis. Patients are generally symp- tomatic from their inflammatory bowel disease long  before cancer risk develops.","A. Father, paternal aunt, and paternal cousin with colon cancer with ages of diagnosis of 54, 68, and 37 years, respectively

This family history of colon cancer at a relatively young age would prompt investigation for hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer screening in the 32-year-old man.","A. Father, paternal aunt, and paternal cousin with colon cancer with ages of diagnosis of 54, 68, and 37 years, respectively"
109,"All of the following statements regarding pancreatic  cancer are true EXCEPT: A. Alcohol consumption is not a risk factor for pancre- atic cancer. B. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. C. Despite accounting for fewer than 5% of malignan- cies diagnosed in the United States, pancreatic cancer  is the fourth leading cause of cancer death. D. If detected early, the 5-year survival rate is up to 20%. E. The 5-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer have  improved substantially in the past decade.","The answer is E.  (Chap. 40) Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause  of cancer death in the United States despite representing   Review and Self-Assessment 782 only 3% of all newly diagnosed malignancies. Infiltrat- ing ductal adenocarcinomas account for the vast majority  of cases and arise most frequently in the head of pan- creas. At the time of diagnosis, 85â€“90% of patients have  inoperable or metastatic disease, which is reflected in  the 5-year survival rate of only 5% for all stages com- bined. An improved 5-year survival of up to 20% may  be achieved when the tumor is detected at an early stage  and when complete surgical resection is accomplished.  Over the past 30 years, 5-year survival rates have not  improved substantially. Cigarette smoking may be the  cause of up to 20â€“25% of all pancreatic cancers and is the  most common environmental risk factor for this disease.  Other risk factors are not well established because of  inconsistent results from epidemiologic studies, but they  include chronic pancreatitis and diabetes. Alcohol does  not appear to be a risk factor unless excess consumption  gives rise to chronic pancreatitis.","E. The 5-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer have improved substantially in the past decade. (This statement is false, as the 5-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer have not improved significantly in the past decade.)",Alcohol consumption is not a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.
110,A 65-year-old man is evaluated in clinic for   1 month of progressive painless jaundice and 10 lb  of unintentional weight loss. His physical exami- nation is unremarkable. A dual-phase contrast CT  shows a suspicious mass in the head of the pancreas  with biliary ductal dilation. Which of the following  is the best diagnostic test to evaluate for suspected  pancreatic cancer?  Review and Self-Assessment 746 A. CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy B. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy C. ERCP with pancreatic juice sampling for cytopa- thology D. FDG-PET imaging E. Serum CA 19-9,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 40) Dual-phase, contrast-enhanced spiral com- puted tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of  choice to visualize suspected pancreatic masses. In addi- tion to imaging the pancreas, it also provides accurate  visualization of surrounding viscera, vessels, and lymph  nodes. In most cases, this study can determine surgical  resectability. There is no advantage of magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) over CT in predicting tumor  resectability, but selected cases may benefit from MRI  to characterize the nature of small indeterminate liver  lesions and to evaluate the cause of biliary dilation when  no obvious mass is seen on CT. Preoperative confirma- tion of malignancy is not always necessary in patients  with radiologic appearances consistent with operable  pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle  biopsy is the most effective technique to evaluate the  mass for malignancy. It has an accuracy of approximately  90% and has a smaller risk of intraperitoneal dissemination  compared with CT-guided percutaneous biopsy. Endo- scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)  is a useful method for obtaining ductal brushings, but  the diagnostic value of pancreatic juice sampling is only  25â€“30%. CA 19-9 is elevated in approximately 70â€“80%  of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, but ERCP is not  recommended as a routine diagnostic or screening test  because its sensitivity and specificity are inadequate for  accurate diagnosis. Preoperative CA 19-9 levels correlate  with tumor stage and prognosis. It is also an indicator  of asymptomatic recurrence in patients with completely  resected tumors. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission  tomography (FDG-PET) should be considered before  surgery for detecting distant metastases.","B. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy is the best diagnostic test for suspected pancreatic cancer because it allows for direct visualization and sampling of the suspicious mass in the pancreas. CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy may not provide adequate tissue samples, ERCP with pancreatic juice sampling is invasive and may not provide a definitive diagnosis, FDG-PET imaging is used for staging rather than diagnosis, and serum CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in pancreatic cancer but is not specific for diagnosis.",D.

111,"A 63-year-old man complains of notable pink- tinged urine for the past month. At first he thought  it was caused by eating beets, but has not cleared. His  medical history is notable for hypertension and ciga- rette smoking. He does report some worsening uri- nary frequency and hesitancy over the past 2 years.  Physical examination is unremarkable. Urinalysis is  notable for gross hematuria with no white blood  cells or casts. Renal function is normal. Which of the  following statements regarding this patient is true? A. Cigarette smoking is not a risk for bladder cancer. B. Gross hematuria makes prostate cancer more likely  than bladder cancer. C. If invasive bladder cancer with nodal involvement  but no distant metastases is found, the 5-year rate  survival is 20%. D. If superficial bladder cancer is found, intravesicular  BCG may be used as adjuvant therapy. E. Radical cystectomy is generally recommended for  invasive bladder cancer.","The answer is D.  (Chap. 41) Bladder cancer is the fourth most common  cancer in men and the thirteenth most common cancer  in women. Cigarette smoking has a strong association  with bladder cancer, particularly in men. The increased  risk persists for at least 10 years after quitting. Bladder  cancer is a small cause of cancer deaths because most  detected cases are superficial with an excellent progno- sis. Most cases of bladder cancer come to medical atten- tion by the presence of gross hematuria emanating from  exophytic lesions. Microscopic hematuria is more likely  caused by prostate cancer than bladder cancer. Cystos- copy under anesthesia is indicated to evaluate for bladder  cancer. In cases of superficial disease, bacille Calmette- GuÃ©rin is an effective adjuvant to decrease recurrence  or treat unresectable superficial disease. In the United  States, cystectomy is generally recommended for inva- sive disease. Even invasive cancer with nodal involve- ment has a >40% 10-year survival after surgery and adju- vant therapy.","D. If superficial bladder cancer is found, intravesicular BCG may be used as adjuvant therapy.

Intravesicular BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) therapy is a common treatment for superficial bladder cancer. It involves instilling a weakened form of the tuberculosis bacteria directly into the bladder to stimulate the immune system and help prevent cancer recurrence.","D. If superficial bladder cancer is found, intravesicular BCG may be used as adjuvant therapy."

114,Which of the following statements describes the  relationship between testicular tumors and serum  markers? A. Pure seminomas produce Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) or  beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) in  >90% of cases. B. More than 40% of nonseminomatous germ cell  tumors produce no cell markers. C. Both Î²-hCG and AFP should be measured in fol- lowing the progress of a tumor. D. Measurement of tumor markers the day after surgery  for localized disease is useful in determining the  completeness of the resection. E. Î²-hCG is limited in its usefulness as a marker  because it is identical to human luteinizing hormone.,"The answer is C. (Chap. 43) Ninety percent of persons with nonsemino- matous germ cell tumors produce either Î±-fetoprotein  (AFP) or beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG);  in contrast, persons with pure seminomas usually produce  neither. These tumor markers are present for some time  after surgery; if the presurgical levels are high, 30 days  or more may be required before meaningful postsurgi- cal levels can be obtained. The half-lives of AFP and  Î²-hCG are 6 days and 1 day, respectively. After treat- ment, unequal reduction of Î²-hCG and AFP may occur,  suggesting that the two markers are synthesized by het- erogeneous clones of cells within the tumor; thus, both  markers should be followed.

Beta human   Review and Self-Assessment 747    chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) is normal, as is  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). You send the patient  for an orchiectomy. The pathology comes back as  seminoma limited to the testis alone. The AFP level  declines to normal at an appropriate interval. What  is the appropriate management at this point? A. Radiation to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes B. Adjuvant chemotherapy C. Hormonal therapy D. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) E. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan","The answer is D.  (Chap. 43) Testicular cancer occurs most commonly  in the second and third decades of life. The treatment  depends on the underlying pathology and the stage of  the disease. Germ cell tumors are divided into semino- matous and nonseminomatous subtypes. Although the  pathology of this patientâ€™s tumor was seminoma, the  presence of Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) is suggestive of occult  nonseminomatous components. If there are any non- seminomatous components, the treatment follows that  of a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. This patient  therefore has a clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ  cell tumor. Because his AFP returned to normal after  orchiectomy, there is no obvious occult disease. How- ever, between 20% and 50% of these patients will have  disease in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Numerous  trials have indicated no overall survival difference in this  cohort between observation and retroperitoneal lymph  node dissection (RPLND). Because of the potential side  effects of RPLND, the choice of surveillance or RPLND  is based on the pathology of the primary tumor. If the  primary tumor shows no evidence for lymphatic or vas- cular invasion and is limited to the testis, then either  option is reasonable. If lymphatic or vascular invasion  is present or the tumor extends into the tunica, sper- matic cord, or scrotum, then surveillance should not be  offered. Either approach should cure >95% of patients.  Radiation therapy is the appropriate choice for stage I  and stage II seminoma. It has no role in nonseminoma- tous lesions. Adjuvant chemotherapy is not indicated in  early-stage testicular cancer. Hormonal therapy is effec- tive for prostate cancer and receptor-positive breast can- cer but has no role in testicular cancer. Positron emission  tomography may be used to locate viable seminoma in  residua which mandates surgical excision or biopsy.","B. Adjuvant chemotherapy

After orchiectomy for seminoma limited to the testis alone, adjuvant chemotherapy is the appropriate management to reduce the risk of recurrence. Radiation therapy may also be considered in some cases, but chemotherapy is typically preferred. Hormonal therapy and RPLND are not typically used in the management of seminoma. A PET scan may be used for staging and monitoring response to treatment, but it is not typically used as a primary treatment modality.",D. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)
116,Which of the following statements regarding the  relationship between ovarian cancer and BRCA  gene mutations is true? A. Most women with BRCA mutations have a family  history that is strongly positive for breast or ovarian  cancer (or both). B. More than 30% of women with ovarian cancer   have a somatic mutation in either BRCA1 or  BRCA2. C. Prophylactic oophorectomy in patients with BRCA  mutations does not protect against the development  of breast cancer. D. Screening studies with serial ultrasound and serum  CA-125 tumor marker studies are effective in   detecting early stage disease. E. Women with known mutations in a single BRCA1  or BRCA2 allele have a 75% lifetime risk of devel- oping ovarian cancer.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 44) Approximately 10% of women with ovar- ian cancer have a somatic mutation in one of two DNA  repair genes, BRCA1 (chromosome 17q12-21) or  BRCA2 (chromosome 13q12-13). Individuals inheriting  a single copy of a mutant allele have a very high inci- dence of breast and ovarian cancer. Most of these women  have a family history that is notable for multiple cases of  breast or ovarian cancer (or both), although inheritance  through male members of the family can camouflage this  genotype through several generations. The most com- mon malignancy in these women is breast carcinoma,  although women harboring germ-line BRCA1 muta- tions have a marked increased risk of developing ovarian  malignancies in their forties and fifties with a 30â€“50%  lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. Women har- boring a mutation in BRCA2 have a lower penetrance  of ovarian cancer with perhaps a 20â€“40% chance of  developing this malignancy, with onset typically in their  fifties or sixties. Women with a BRCA2 mutation also  are at slightly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Screen- ing studies in this select population suggest that current  screening techniques, including serial evaluation of the  CA-125 tumor marker and ultrasound, are insufficient  at detecting early-stage and curable disease, so women  with these germ-line mutations are advised to undergo  prophylactic removal of their ovaries and fallopian tubes  typically after completing childbearing and ideally before  ages 35 to 40 years. Early prophylactic oophorectomy also  protects these women from subsequent breast cancer with  a reduction of breast cancer risk of approximately 50%.",B.

Endometrial carcinoma is the most common   gynecologic malignancy in the United States. C. Most women present with amenorrhea. D. Tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of  endometrial carcinoma. E. Unopposed estrogen exposure is a risk factor for  developing endometrial carcinoma.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 44) Endometrial carcinoma is the most common  gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Most are  adenocarcinomas. Development of these tumors is a mul- tistep process with estrogen playing an important early  role in driving endometrial gland proliferation. Relative  overexposure to this class of hormones is a risk factor  for the subsequent development of endometrial tumors.    Review and Self-Assessment 784 In contrast, progestins drive glandular maturation and  are protective. Hence, women with high endogenous or  pharmacologic exposure to estrogens, especially if unop- posed by progesterone, are at high risk for endometrial  cancer. Obese women, women treated with unopposed  estrogens, and women with estrogen-producing tumors  (e.g., granulosa cell tumors of the ovary) are at higher  risk for endometrial cancer. In addition, treatment with  tamoxifen, which has anti-estrogenic effects in breast tis- sue but estrogenic effects in uterine epithelium, is associ- ated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The  majority of women with tumors of the uterine corpus  present with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding caused  by shedding of the malignant endometrial lining. Pre- menopausal women often present with atypical bleeding  between typical menstrual cycles. These signs typically  bring a woman to the attention of a health care profes- sional, and hence the majority of women present with  early-stage disease in which the tumor is confined to the  uterine corpus. For patients with disease confined to the  uterus, hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes  and ovaries results in approximately 90% 5-year survival.","C.

Laboratory studies are notable for an elevated      alkaline phosphatase. A lumbar radiogram shows a  lytic lesion in the L3 vertebra. Which of the fol- lowing malignancies is most likely? A. Gastric carcinoma B. Nonâ€“small cell lung cancer C. Osteosarcoma D. Pancreatic carcinoma E. Thyroid carcinoma,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 45) Bone pain resulting from metastatic lesions  may be difficult to distinguish from degenerative disease,  osteoporosis, or disk disease in elderly individuals. Gen- erally, these patients present with insidious worsening  localized pain without fevers or signs of infection. In  contrast to pain related to disk disease, the pain of meta- static disease is worse when the patient is lying down  or at night. Neurologic symptoms related to metastatic  disease constitute an emergency. Lung, breast, and pros- tate cancers account for approximately 80% of bone  metastases. Thyroid carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma,  lymphoma, and bladder carcinoma may also metastasize  to bone. Metastatic lesions may be lytic or blastic. Most  cancers cause a combination of both, although prostate  cancer is predominantly blastic. Either lesion may cause  hypercalcemia, although lytic lesions more commonly  do this. Lytic lesions are best detected with plain radi- ography. Blastic lesions are prominent on radionuclide  bone scans. Treatment and prognosis depend on the  underlying malignancy. Bisphosphonates may reduce  hypercalcemia, relieve pain, and limit bone resorption.","C. Osteosarcoma

Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that commonly presents with increasing back pain, especially at night. It can cause lytic lesions in the vertebrae, which can be seen on imaging studies.

(Chap. 45) Metastatic tumors of bone are more common  than primary bone tumors. Prostate, breast, and lung pri- maries account for 80% of all bone metastases. Tumors  from the kidney, bladder, and thyroid and lympho- mas and sarcomas also commonly metastasize to bone.  Metastases usually spread hematogenously. In decreasing  order, the most common sites of bone metastases include  the vertebrae, proximal femur, pelvis, ribs, sternum,  proximal humerus, and skull. Pain is the most common  symptom. Hypercalcemia may occur with bone destruc- tion. Lesions may be osteolytic, osteoblastic, or both.  Osteoblastic lesions are associated with a higher level of  alkaline phosphatase. Colon cancer typically metastasizes  initially via lymphatic spread, making the liver and lungs  common sites of secondary disease.","C. Kidney

Kidney tumors are less likely to metastasize to bone compared to breast, colon, lung, and prostate tumors. Bone metastases are more common in cancers that originate in organs such as the breast, lung, prostate, and colon.",A. Colon
120,"A 22-year-old man comes into clinic because of a  swollen leg. He does not remember any trauma to  the leg, but the pain and swelling began 3 weeks  ago in the anterior shin area of his left foot. He is a  college student and is active in sports daily. A radio- graph of the right leg shows a destructive lesion  with a â€œmoth-eatenâ€_x009d_ appearance extending into  the soft tissue and a spiculated periosteal reaction.  Codmanâ€™s triangle (a cuff of periosteal bone forma- tion at the margin of the bone and soft tissue mass)  is present. Which of the following are the most  likely diagnosis and optimal therapy for this lesion? A. Chondrosarcoma; chemotherapy alone is curative B. Chondrosarcoma; radiation with limited surgical  resection C. Osteosarcoma; preoperative chemotherapy followed  by limb-sparing surgery D. Osteosarcoma; radiation therapy E. Plasma cell tumor; chemotherapy","The answer is C.  (Chap. 45) The most common malignant tumors of bone  are plasma cell tumors related to multiple myeloma.  The bone lesions are lytic lesions caused by increased  osteoclast activity without osteoblastic new bone for- mation. Of the nonhematopoietic tumors, the most  common are osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewingâ€™s  sarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Osteosar- comas account for 45% of bone sarcomas and produce  osteoid (unmineralized bone) or bone. They typically  occur in children, adolescents, and adults up to the third  decade of life. The â€œsunburstâ€_x009d_ appearance of the lesion  and Codmanâ€™s triangle in this young man are indica- tive of an osteosarcoma. Whereas osteosarcomas have a  predilection for long bones, chondrosarcomas are more  often found in flat bones, especially the shoulder and  pelvic girdles. Osteosarcomas are radioresistant. Long- term survival with combined chemotherapy and sur- gery is 60â€“80%. Chondrosarcomas account for 20â€“25%  of bone sarcomas and are most common in adults in  the fourth to sixth decades of life. They typically pres- ent indolently with pain and swelling. They are often  difficult to distinguish from benign bone lesions. Most  chondrosarcomas are chemoresistant, and the mainstay  of therapy is resection of the primary as well as meta- static sites.","C. Osteosarcoma; preoperative chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing surgery

Osteosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the presentation and radiographic findings described. The optimal therapy for osteosarcoma typically involves preoperative chemotherapy to shrink the tumor followed by limb-sparing surgery to remove the affected bone while preserving function. Radiation therapy is not typically used as a primary treatment for osteosarcoma.",C. Osteosarcoma; preoperative chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing surgery

Cytokeratin  Review and Self-Assessment 748 C. Leukocyte common antigen D. Thyroglobulin E. Thyroid transcription factor 1","The answer is B.  (Chap. 47) Patients with cancer from an unknown pri- mary site present a common diagnostic dilemma. Initial  evaluation should include history, physical examination,  appropriate imaging, and blood studies based on gen- der (e.g., prostate-specific antigen in men, mammog- raphy in women). Immunohistochemical staining of  biopsy samples using antibodies to specific cell compo- nents may help elucidate the site of the primary tumor.  Although many immunohistochemical stains are avail- able, a logical approach is represented in Figure 47-1.  Additional tests may be helpful based on the appearance  under light microscopy or the results of the cytokeratin  stains. In cases of cancer of unknown primary, cytokera- tin staining is usually the first branch point from which  the tumor lineage is determined. Cytokeratin is positive  in carcinoma because all epithelial tumors contain this  protein. Subsets of cytokeratin, such as CK7 and CK20,  may be useful to determine the likely etiology of the pri- mary tumor. Leukocyte common antigen, thyroglobu- lin, and thyroid transcription factor 1 are characteristic of  lymphoma, thyroid cancer, and lung or thyroid cancer,   Review and Self-Assessment 785 respectively. Î±-Fetoprotein staining is typically positive  in germ cell, stomach, and liver carcinoma.","A. Î±-Fetoprotein

Î±-Fetoprotein is a marker commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma. Elevated levels of α-fetoprotein in the blood can indicate the presence of liver cancer.

Cytokeratin is a broad group of proteins that are commonly used as markers for epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the liver and other organs. Cytokeratin staining can help differentiate between different types of liver cancer.

Leukocyte common antigen is a marker for cells of the immune system and is not typically used in the diagnosis of liver cancer.

PSA E. C-reactive protein","The answer is B.  (Chap. 47) The patient is a young man with asymmet- ric hilar adenopathy. The differential diagnosis would  include lymphoma; testicular cancer; and, less likely,  tuberculosis or histoplasmosis. Because of his young age,  testicular examination and ultrasonography would be  indicated, as would measurement of Î±-fetoprotein (AFP)  or beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG), which  are generally markedly elevated. In men with carcinoma  of unknown primary source, AFP and Î²-hCG should  be checked because the presence of testicular cancer  portends an improved prognosis compared with pos- sible primary sources. Biopsy would show lymphoma.  The ACE level may be elevated but is not diagnostic of  sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis should not be considered likely  in the presence of asymmetric hilar adenopathy. Thy- roid disorders are not likely to present with unilateral  hilar adenopathy. Finally, prostate-specific antigen is not  indicated in this age category, and C-reactive protein  would not differentiate any of the disorders mentioned  above.

He  has AIDS and is not under any care at this time.  His physical examination is most notable for small,  shoddy lymphadenopathy in the cervical region.  A head CT shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the  right temporal lobe, with edema but no mass effect.  A lumbar puncture shows no white or red blood  cells, and the Gram stain is negative. His serum  Toxoplasma IgG is positive. He is treated with pyri- methamine, sulfadiazine, and levetiracetam.

All microbiologic cultures and     viral studies, including Epstein-Barr virus DNA  from the cerebrospinal fluid, are negative. What is  the best course of action for this patient at this time? A. Continue treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis B. Dexamethasone C. IV acyclovir D. Stereotactic brain biopsy E. Whole-brain radiation therapy","The answer is D.  (Chap. 46) Distinguishing central nervous system (CNS)  toxoplasmosis from primary CNS lymphoma in a  patient with HIV infection is often difficult. The stan- dard approach in a neurologically stable patient is to treat  the patient for toxoplasmosis for 2â€“3 weeks then repeat  neuroimaging. If the imaging shows clear improvement,  continue antibiotics. If there is no response to therapy  after 2 weeks, therapy does not need to be  continued  and a stereotactic brain biopsy is indicated. In this  immunocompromised patient who has not responded to  treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis, a positive CNS EBV  DNA would be diagnostic of CNS lymphoma. Whole- brain radiation therapy is part of the treatment for CNS  lymphoma, which is not yet diagnosed in this patient,  and should not be instituted empirically. Treatments  directed at viral infections of the CNS or CNS lym- phomas are not indicated at this time since a diagnosis is  still yet to be made. In the absence of a change in neu- rologic status or evidence of mass effect on CT, there is  no indication for dexamethasone. Of note, the incidence  of primary CNS lymphoma appears to be increasing in  immunocompetent individuals for unclear reasons.","D. Stereotactic brain biopsy

Given the lack of improvement in the CNS lesion and the negative results of all microbiologic cultures and viral studies, a stereotactic brain biopsy would be the best course of action to definitively diagnose the cause of the lesion. This would help determine if the current treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis is appropriate or if a different treatment approach is needed.",Continue treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis

A labora- tory workup reveals a decreased morning cortisol  level of 1.9 Î¼g/dL. In addition to depressed adre- nocorticotropic hormone function, which of the  following hormones is most sensitive to damage  from whole-brain radiation therapy? A. Growth hormone B. Follicle-stimulating hormone C. Prolactin D. Thyroid-stimulating hormone","The answer is A.  (Chap. 46) Endocrine dysfunction resulting in hypopi- tuitarism frequently follows exposure of the hypothala- mus or pituitary gland to therapeutic radiation. Growth  hormone is the most sensitive to the damaging effects of  whole-brain radiation therapy, and thyroid-stimulating  hormone is the least sensitive. Adrenocorticotropic hor- mone, prolactin, and gonadotropins have an intermedi- ate sensitivity. Other complications of radiation therapy  to the brain include acute radiation injury manifest by  headache, sleepiness, and worsening of preexisting neu- rologic defects. Early delayed radiation injury occurs  within the first 4 months after therapy. It is associated  with increased white matter signal on magnetic reso- nance imaging and is steroid responsive. Late delayed  radiation injury occurs >4 months after therapy, typi- cally 8â€“24 months. There may be dementia, gait apraxia,  focal necrosis (after focal irradiation), or the develop- ment of secondary malignancies.","A. Growth hormone

Whole-brain radiation therapy can damage the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to deficiencies in various hormones. Growth hormone is particularly sensitive to damage from radiation therapy, as it is produced by the pituitary gland and can be affected by radiation-induced damage to this area. This can result in growth hormone deficiency, which can lead to symptoms such as weight gain and low energy.",Thyroid-stimulating hormone

FIGURE 135  Review and Self-Assessment 749 A. Brain abscess B. Glioblastoma C. Low-grade astrocytoma D. Meningioma E. Oligodendroglioma","The answer is D.  (Chap. 46) The postgadolinium magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) shows multiple meningiomas along the falx  and left parietal cortex. Meningiomas derive from the  cells that give rise to the arachnoid granulations. They are  now the most common primary brain tumor, account- ing for approximately 32% of the total, and occur more  commonly in women than men. They are usually benign  (World Heatlh Organization classification grade 1) and  attached to the dura. They rarely invade the brain.  Meningiomas are diagnosed with increasing frequency  as more people undergo neuroimaging studies for vari- ous indications. Their incidence increases with age, and  they are more common in patients with a history of   cranial irradiation. They are most commonly located  over the cerebral convexities, especially adjacent to the  sagittal sinus, but can also occur in the skull base and  along the dorsum of the spinal cord. Many meningio- mas are found incidentally following neuroimaging for  unrelated reasons. They can also present with headaches,  seizures, or focal neurologic deficits. On imaging studies   Review and Self-Assessment 786 they have a characteristic appearance usually consisting of  a partially calcified, densely enhancing extra-axial tumor  arising from the dura. The main differential diagnosis of  meningioma is a dural metastasis. Total surgical resection  of a meningioma is curative. Low-grade astrocytoma and  high-grade astrocytoma (glioblastoma) often infiltrate  into adjacent brain and rarely have the clear margins seen  in Figure 135. Oligodendroma comprise approximately  15% of all gliomas and show calcification in roughly 30%  of cases. They have a more benign course and are more  responsive than other gliomas to cytotoxic therapy. For  low-grade oligodendromas, the median survival is 7â€“8  years. Brain abscess will have distinctive ring-enhancing  features with a capsule, will often have mass effect, and  will have evidence of inflammation on MRI scanning.","B. Glioblastoma

Glioblastoma is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on the clinical presentation of worsening headache, seizure, and abnormal MRI findings. Glioblastoma is a type of aggressive brain tumor that can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and neurological deficits. The MRI findings in this case are consistent with the characteristic features of glioblastoma, such as irregular enhancement and surrounding edema. Brain abscess, low-grade astrocytoma, meningioma, and oligodendroglioma are less likely based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.",The most likely diagnosis in this patient is D.

His thyroid-  stimulating hormone (TSH) level is checked and  is found to be low. What is the next step in his  evaluation? A. Close follow-up and measure TSH in 6 months B. Fine-needle aspiration C. Low-dose thyroid replacement D. Positron emission tomography followed by surgery E. Radionuclide thyroid scan,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 48) Thyroid nodules are found in 5% of patients.  Nodules are more common with age, in women, and in  iodine-deficient areas. Given their prevalence, the cost of  screening, and the generally benign course of most nod- ules, the choice and order of screening tests have been  very contentious. A small percentage of incidentally dis- covered nodules will represent thyroid cancer, however.  A TSH should be the first test to check after detection of  a thyroid nodule. A majority of patients will have nor- mal thyroid function tests. In the case of a normal TSH,  fine-needle aspiration or ultrasound-guided biopsy can  be pursued. If the TSH is low, a radionuclide scan should  be performed to determine if the nodule is the source of  thyroid hyperfunction (a â€œhotâ€_x009d_ nodule). In this case, this  is the best course of action. â€œHotâ€_x009d_ nodules can be treated  medically, resected, or ablated with radioactive iodine.  â€œColdâ€_x009d_ nodules should be further evaluated with a fine- needle aspiration. Four percent of nodules undergoing  biopsy are malignant, 10% are suspicious for malignancy,  and 86% are indeterminate or benign.","B. Fine-needle aspiration

A low TSH level in the presence of a thyroid nodule raises concern for hyperthyroidism, which can be caused by conditions such as toxic multinodular goiter or thyroid adenoma. Fine-needle aspiration can help determine if the nodule is benign or malignant.",B. Fine-needle aspiration

Fine-needle aspiration may distinguish between be- nign and malignant primary adrenal tumors. C. In patients with a history of malignancy, the likelihood  that the mass is a metastasis is approximately 50%. D. The majority of adrenal incidentalomas are non- secretory. E. The vast majority of adrenal incidentalomas are  benign.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 51) Incidental adrenal masses are often discovered  during radiographic testing for another condition and are  found in approximately 6% of adult subjects at autopsy.  Fifty percent of patients with a history of malignancy and a  newly discovered adrenal mass will actually have an adrenal  metastasis. Fine-needle aspiration of a suspected metastatic  malignancy will often be diagnostic. In the absence of a sus- pected nonadrenal malignancy, most adrenal incidentalo- mas are benign. Primary adrenal malignancies are uncom- mon (<0.01%), and fine-needle aspiration is not useful to  distinguish between benign and malignant primary adrenal  tumors. Although 90% of these masses are nonsecretory,  patients with an incidentaloma should be screened for  pheochromocytoma and hypercortisolism with plasma free  metanephrines and an overnight dexamethasone suppres- sion test, respectively. When radiographic features suggest  a benign neoplasm (<3 cm), scanning should be repeated  in 3â€“6 months.

Gastric pH measurement. D. Plasma gastrin level. E. Screen for parathyroid hyperplasia.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 49) The patient presents with recurrent peptic  ulcers without evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection.  The diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES)  should be obtained. Additional features that suggest  nonclassic idiopathic ulcer disease include the presence  of diarrhea, which is commonly present in ZES, but  not idiopathic ulcers. The diagnosis is commonly made  through measurement of plasma gastrin levels, which  should be markedly elevated, but common use of proton  pump inhibitors (PPIs) that potently suppress gastric acid  secretion confound this measurement. Because PPI use  suppresses gastric acid production, gastrin rises. Thus PPI  use should be discontinued for 1 week prior to measure- ment of gastrin in plasma. Often this requires collabora- tion with gastroenterologists to ensure safety and poten- tially offer alternative pharmacology during this time.  Once hypergastrinemia is confirmed, the presence of  low gastric pH must be confirmed, as the most common  cause of elevated gastrin is achlorhydria due to perni- cious anemia. Imaging of the abdomen is indicated after  demonstration of hypergastrinemia. Finally, although  ZES may be associated with multiple endocrine neo- plasia type 1, which often has parathyroid hyperplasia or  adenoma, this is less likely than isolated ZES.","E. Screen for parathyroid hyperplasia.

This patient's symptoms, history of multiple duodenal ulcers, and lack of Helicobacter pylori infection suggest the possibility of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). ZES is a rare condition characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) in the pancreas or duodenum, leading to excessive gastrin production and acid hypersecretion. This results in multiple peptic ulcers in the stomach and duodenum.

Screening for parathyroid hyperplasia is important in the evaluation of ZES, as it is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome, which includes ZES as one of its manifestations. Plasma gastrin levels can also be measured to confirm the diagnosis of ZES.",B. Discontinue omeprazole for 1 week and measure plasma gastrin level.

This patient's presentation is consistent with VIPoma, a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIPoma causes watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome).

Increased pancreatic  islet cell hormones include pancreatic polypeptide, gas- trin, insulin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucagons, and  somatostatin. Pancreatic tumors may be multicentric,  and up to 30% are malignant, with the liver being the  first site of metastases. The symptoms depend on the type  of hormone secreted. The Zollinger-Ellison syndrome  causes elevations of gastrin, resulting in an ulcer diathesis.  Conservative therapy is often unsuccessful. Insulinoma  results in documented hypoglycemia with elevated insu- lin and C-peptide levels. Glucagonoma results in hyper- glycemia, skin rash, anorexia, glossitis, and diarrhea. Ele- vations in vasoactive intestinal peptide result in profuse  watery diarrhea. Pituitary tumors occur in up to half of  patients with MEN 1. Prolactinomas are the most com- mon. The multicentricity of the tumors makes resection  difficult. Growth hormoneâ€“secreting tumors are the next  most common, with adrenocorticotropic hormoneâ€“ and  corticotropin-releasing hormoneâ€“secreting tumors being  more rare. Carcinoid tumors may also occur in the thy- mus, lung, stomach, and duodenum.","A. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1

The patient's presentation with hypercalcemia, abdominal discomfort, and a lesion in the head of the pancreas is consistent with MEN type 1, which is characterized by tumors in multiple endocrine glands, including the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary gland. MEN type 1 is associated with hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and pituitary adenomas. The elevated calcium levels and parathyroid hormone levels seen in this patient are indicative of primary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common feature of MEN type 1.",The diagnosis is A. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1.
133,"A 43-year-old man with episodic, severe hyperten- sion is referred for evaluation of possible secondary  causes of hypertension. He reports feeling well gen- erally, except for episodes of anxiety, palpitations,  and tachycardia with elevation in his blood pres- sure during these episodes. Exercise often brings on  these events. The patient also has mild depression  and is presently taking sertraline, labetalol, amlo- dipine, and lisinopril to control his blood pressure.  Urine 24-hour total metanephrines are ordered and  show an elevation of 1.5 times the upper limit of  normal. Which of the following is the next most  appropriate step? A. Hold labetalol for 1 week and repeat testing. B. Hold sertraline for 1 week and repeat testing. C. Immediately refer for surgical evaluation. D. Measure 24-hour urine vanillymandelic acid level. E. Send for MRI of the abdomen.","The answer is A.  (Chap. 51) When the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma  is entertained, the first step is measurement of catechol- amines and/or metanephrines. This can be achieved by  urinary tests for vanillylmandelic acid, catecholamines,  fractionated metanephrines, or total metanephrines.  Total metanephrines have a high sensitivity and there- fore are frequently used. A value of three times the upper  limit of normal is highly suggestive of pheochromocy- toma. Borderline elevations, as this patient had, are likely  to be false positives. The next most appropriate step is to  remove potentially confounding dietary or drug expo- sures, if possible, and repeat the test. Likely culprit drugs  include levodopa, sympathomimetics, diuretics, tricyclic  antidepressants, and alpha and beta blockers (labetalol  in this case). Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitor antidepressant, not a tricyclic. Alternatively, a  clonidine suppression test may be ordered.","E. Send for MRI of the abdomen.

Given the elevated urine metanephrines, the next step would be to evaluate for a possible pheochromocytoma, which is a rare but potentially serious cause of secondary hypertension. An MRI of the abdomen can help identify any adrenal tumors that may be causing the elevated metanephrines. Holding medications or repeating testing may not be necessary at this point, as further evaluation is warranted.",D. Measure 24-hour urine vanillymandelic acid level.
134,"A 45-year-old man is diagnosed with pheochromo- cytoma after presentation with confusion, marked  hypertension to 250/140 mm Hg, tachycardia,  headaches, and flushing. His fractionated plasma  metanephrines show a normetanephrine level of  560 pg/mL and a metanephrine level of 198 pg/mL  (normal values: normetanephrine: 18â€“111 pg/mL;  metanephrine: 12â€“60 pg/mL). CT scanning of the  abdomen with IV contrast demonstrates a 3-cm mass  in the right adrenal gland. A brain MRI with gado- linium shows edema of the white matter near the  parietooccipital junction consistent with reversible   Review and Self-Assessment 751    posterior leukoencephalopathy. You are asked to  consult regarding management. Which of the fol- lowing statements is true regarding management of  pheochromocytoma is this individual? A. Beta-blockade is absolutely contraindicated for  tachycardia even after adequate alpha-blockade has  been attained. B. Immediate surgical removal of the mass is indicated,  because the patient presented with hypertensive crisis  with encephalopathy. C. Salt and fluid intake should be restricted to prevent  further exacerbation of the patientâ€™s hypertension. D. Treatment with phenoxybenzamine should be  started at a high dose (20â€“30 mg three times daily)  to rapidly control blood pressure, and surgery can be  undertaken within 24â€“48 hours. E. Treatment with IV phentolamine is indicated for  treatment of the hypertensive crisis. Phenoxybenza- mine should be started at a low dose and titrated to  the maximum tolerated dose over 2â€“3 weeks. Sur- gery should not be planned until the blood pressure  is consistently below 160/100 mm Hg.","The answer is E.  (Chap. 51) Complete removal of the pheochromocy- toma is the only therapy that leads to a long-term cure,  although 90% of tumors are benign. However, preop- erative control of hypertension is necessary to prevent  surgical complications and lower mortality. This patient  is presenting with encephalopathy in a hypertensive cri- sis. The hypertension should be managed initially with  IV medications to lower the mean arterial pressure by  approximately 20% over the initial 24-hour period.   Review and Self-Assessment 788 Medications that can be used for hypertensive crisis in  pheochromocytoma include nitroprusside, nicardipine,  and phentolamine. Once the acute hypertensive crisis  has resolved, transition to oral Î±-adrenergic blockers is  indicated. Phenoxybenzamine is the most commonly  used drug and is started at low doses (5â€“10 mg three  times daily) and titrated to the maximum tolerated dose  (usually 20â€“30 mg daily). Once alpha blockers have been  initiated, beta blockade can safely be utilized and is par- ticularly indicated for ongoing tachycardia. Liberal salt  and fluid intake helps expand plasma volume and treat  orthostatic hypotension. Once blood pressure is main- tained below 160/100 mm Hg with moderate ortho- stasis, it is safe to proceed to surgery. If blood pressure  remains elevated despite treatment with alpha blockade,  addition of calcium channel blockers, angiotensin recep- tor blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi- tors should be considered. Diuretics should be avoided,  as they will exacerbate orthostasis.","E. Treatment with IV phentolamine is indicated for treatment of the hypertensive crisis. Phenoxybenzamine should be started at a low dose and titrated to the maximum tolerated dose over 2-3 weeks. Surgery should not be planned until the blood pressure is consistently below 160/100 mm Hg.

In the management of pheochromocytoma, it is important to first control the patient's hypertension and tachycardia before proceeding with surgical removal of the tumor. This is typically achieved with alpha-blockade using medications such as phenoxybenzamine. Beta-blockade should only be initiated after adequate alpha-blockade has been achieved to prevent unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation.

Immediate surgical removal of the mass is not always indicated, especially in the setting of a hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy. Salt and fluid intake should not be restricted as this can exacerbate the patient's hypertension. Treatment with IV phentolamine can help to rapidly lower blood pressure during a hypertensive crisis, and phenoxybenzamine should be started at a low dose and titrated up gradually to prevent abrupt drops in blood pressure. Surgery should be delayed until blood pressure is well-controlled to reduce the risk of intraoperative complications.",E. Treatment with IV phentolamine is indicated for treatment of the hypertensive crisis. Phenoxybenzamine should be started at a low dose and titrated to the maximum tolerated dose over 2–3 weeks. Surgery should not be planned until the blood pressure is consistently below 160/100 mm Hg.
135,"An 81-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for  altered mental status. He was found at home, con- fused and lethargic, by his son. His medical his- tory is significant for metastatic prostate cancer.  The patientâ€™s medications include periodic intra- muscular goserelin injections. On examination, he  is afebrile. Blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg, and  the pulse rate is 110 beats/min. He is lethargic and  minimally responsive to sternal rub. He has bitem- poral wasting, and his mucous membranes are dry.  On neurologic examination, he is obtunded. The  patient has an intact gag reflex and withdraws to  pain in all four extremities. Rectal tone is normal.  Laboratory values are significant for a creatinine of  4.2 mg/dL, a calcium level of 14.4 mEq/L, and an  albumin of 2.6 g/dL. All the following are appro- priate initial management steps EXCEPT: A. Normal saline B. Pamidronate C. Furosemide when the patient is euvolemic D. Calcitonin E. Dexamethasone","The answer is E.  (Chap. 52) Hypercalcemia is a common oncologic com- plication of metastatic cancer. Symptoms include confu- sion, lethargy, change in mental status, fatigue, polyuria,  and constipation. Regardless of the underlying disease,  the treatment is similar. These patients are often dehy- drated because hypercalcemia may cause nephrogenic  diabetes insipidus and are often unable to take fluids  orally. Therefore, the primary management entails rees- tablishment of euvolemia. Often hypercalcemia resolves  with hydration alone. Patients should be monitored for  hypophosphatemia. Bisphosphonates are now the main- stay of therapy because they stabilize osteoclast resorption  of calcium from the bone. However, their effects may  take 1 to 2 days to manifest. Care must be taken in cases of  renal insufficiency because rapid administration of pami- dronate may exacerbate renal failure. When euvolemia  is achieved, furosemide may be given to increase calci- uresis. Nasal or subcutaneous calcitonin further aids the  shift of calcium out of the intravascular space. Since the  advent of bisphosphonates, calcitonin is only used in  severe cases of hypercalcemia because of its rapid effect.  Glucocorticoids may be useful in patients with lymphoid  malignancies because the mechanism of hypercalcemia in  these conditions is often related to excess hydroxylation  of vitamin D. However, in this patient with prostate can- cer, dexamethasone will have little effect on the calcium  level and may exacerbate the altered mental status.","B. Pamidronate

Pamidronate is a bisphosphonate medication used to treat high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). In this case, the patient's calcium level is elevated, so pamidronate would be an appropriate initial management step.","The appropriate initial management steps for the 81-year-old man with altered mental status and significant laboratory values include normal saline, pamidronate, furosemide when the patient is euvolemic, and dexamethasone. The option that is NOT an appropriate initial management step in this scenario is Calcitonin."
136,A 55-year-old man is found to have a serum calcium  of 13.0 mg/dL after coming to clinic complaining  of fatigue and thirst for the past month. A chest  radiograph demonstrates a 4-cm mass in the right  lower lobe. Which of the following serum tests is  most likely to reveal the cause of his hypercalcemia? A. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) B. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) C. Insulin-like growth factor D. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) E. Parathyroid hormone related protein (PTH-rp),"The answer is E. (Chap. 52) A variety of hormones are produced ectopically  by tumors that may cause symptomatic disease. Eutopic  production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the para- thyroid gland is the most common cause of hypercalce- mia. Hypercalcemia may rarely be produced by ectopic  hyperparathyroid production but is most often caused by  parathyroid hormone related protein (PTH-rp) produc- tion by squamous cell (head and neck, lung, skin), breast,  genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tumors. This protein  can be measured as a serum assay. Antidiuretic hormone,  causing hyponatremia, is commonly produced by lung  (squamous, small cell), gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and  ovary tumors. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, causing  Cushingâ€™s syndrome, is commonly produced by tumors  in the lung (small cell, bronchial carcinoid, adenocarci- noma, squamous), thymus, pancreatic islet, and medullary  thyroid carcinoma. Insulin-like growth factor secreted by   mesenchymal tumors, sarcomas, and adrenal, hepatic,  gastrointestinal, kidney, or prostate tumors may cause  symptomatic hypoglycemia.","E. Parathyroid hormone related protein (PTH-rp)

Hypercalcemia in the setting of a lung mass is most likely due to the production of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTH-rp) by the tumor. PTH-rp acts similarly to parathyroid hormone (PTH) in increasing serum calcium levels. Therefore, measuring PTH-rp levels in this patient would likely reveal the cause of his hypercalcemia.",D. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
137,"A 55-year-old woman presents with progressive  incoordination. Physical examination is remarkable  for nystagmus, mild dysarthria, and past pointing  on finger-to-nose testing. She also has an unsteady  gait. MRI reveals atrophy of both lobes of the cer- ebellum. Serologic evaluation reveals the presence  of anti-Yo antibody. Which of the following is the  most likely cause of this clinical syndrome? A. Nonâ€“small cell cancer of the lung B. Small cell cancer of the lung C. Breast cancer D. Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma E. Colon cancer","The answer is C. (Chap. 53) One of the better characterized paraneoplas- tic neurologic syndromes is cerebellar ataxia caused by  Purkinje cell drop-out in the cerebellum; it is mani- fested by dysarthria, limb and gait ataxia, and nystagmus.  Radiologic imaging reveals cerebellar atrophy. Many  antibodies have been associated with this syndrome,  including anti-Yo, anti-Tr, and antibodies to the gluta- mate receptor. Although lung cancer, particularly small  cell cancer, accounts for a large number of patients with  neoplasm-associated cerebellar ataxia, those with the  syndrome who display anti-Yo antibodies in the serum  typically have breast or ovarian cancer. Cerebellar ataxia  may also be seen in Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma in association  with anti-Tr antibodies.","C. Breast cancer

This patient's presentation is consistent with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, which is most commonly associated with breast cancer. The presence of anti-Yo antibody further supports this diagnosis, as this antibody is often found in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with breast cancer.",C. Breast cancer
138,"A 58-year-old woman with known stage IV breast  cancer presents to the emergency department with  an inability to move her legs. She has had lower back  pain for the past 4 days and has found it difficult to lie  down. There is no radiating pain. Earlier today, the  patient lost the ability to move either of her legs. In  addition, she has been incontinent of urine recently.  She has been diagnosed previously with metastatic  disease to the lung and pleura from her breast cancer  but was not known to have spinal or brain metasta- ses. Her physical examination confirms absence of  movement in the bilateral lower extremities associ- ated with decreased to absent sensation below the  umbilicus. There is increased tone and 3+ deep ten- don reflexes in the lower extremities with crossed  adduction. Anal sphincter tone is decreased, and the  anal wink reflex is absent. What is the most important  first step to take in the management of this patient? A. Administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously. B. Consult neurosurgery for emergent spinal   decompression. C. Consult radiation oncology for emergent spinal  radiation. D. Perform MRI of the brain. E. Perform MRI of the entire spinal cord.","The answer is A.  (Chap. 54) This patient presents with symptoms of spi- nal cord compression in the setting of known stage IV  breast cancer. This represents an oncologic emergency  because only 10% of patients presenting with paraple- gia regain the ability to walk. Most commonly, patients  develop symptoms of localized back pain and tender- ness days to months before developing paraplegia. The  pain is worsened by movement, cough, or sneezing. In  contrast to radicular pain, the pain related to spinal cord  metastases is worse with lying down. Patients presenting  with back pain alone should have a careful examination  to attempt to localize the lesion before development of  more severe neurologic symptoms. In this patient with  paraplegia, there is an definitive level at which sensa- tion is diminished. This level is typically one to two  vertebrae below the site of compression. Other find- ings include spasticity, weakness, and increased deep  tendon reflexes. In those with autonomic dysfunction,  bowel and bladder incontinence occur with decreased  anal tone, absence of the anal wink and bulbocaverno- sus reflexes, and bladder distention. The most important  initial step is the administration of high-dose intravenous  corticosteroids to minimize associated swelling around  the lesion and prevent paraplegia while allowing further   Review and Self-Assessment 789 evaluation and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) should be performed of the entire spinal cord  to evaluate for other metastatic disease that may require  therapy. Although a brain MRI may be indicated in the  future to evaluate for brain metastases, it is not required  in the initial evaluation because the bilateral nature of  the patientâ€™s symptoms and sensory level clearly indicate  the spinal cord as the site of the injury. After an MRI  has been performed, a definitive treatment plan can be  made. Most commonly, radiation therapy is used with or  without surgical decompression.","B. Consult neurosurgery for emergent spinal decompression.

This patient is presenting with symptoms of spinal cord compression, likely due to metastatic disease from her breast cancer. The most important first step in management is to consult neurosurgery for emergent spinal decompression to relieve the pressure on the spinal cord and prevent further neurological deficits. Administering dexamethasone or performing imaging studies can be considered after neurosurgery has been consulted.",B. Consult neurosurgery for emergent spinal decompression.
