The most probable  diagnosis is Iron deficiency anemia, for which one of the  underlying causes can be chronic blood loss.  The investigations required for assessing the patients  conditions are:  ? Evaluation for pulmonary hemosiderosis: to exclude  bleeding from alveolus;  ? Urinary hemosiderin: to assess iron overload (due to  repeated blood transfusions)  ? G1 endoscopy: to assess GI bleeds which may cause  such severe iron deficiency over a period of time. Chapter 10 ? Red Blood Cells and its Disorders 311 Answers with Explanations Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis:  ? Recurrent alveolar bleeding may eventually produce  pulmonary hemosiderosis and fibrosis.   ? Presents withhemoptysis, dyspnea, alveolar opacities  on chest Xray & anemia.  ? Iron in the shed blood is converted to hemosiderin by  pulmonary macrophages, but it cannot be used for Hb  synthesis.   ? Thus, repeated hemorrhages can lead to iron  deficiency despite a normal total amount of body iron.  Bone marrow examination is not required to investigate for  Iron deficiency anemia, hence the answer 183.",No explanation provided.

Resolving power of a light microscope does not depend on,Ans. (d) Thickness of the specimen,"(Ref: Laboratory Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases: Essentials of  Diagnostic Pg. 130)  ? Resolving power: It is defined as the inverse of the  distance or angular separation between two objects  which can be just resolved when viewed through the  optical instrument.  ? Resolving power of a microscope:  ? For microscopes, the resolving power is the inverse  of the distance between two objects that can be just  resolved. This is given by the famous Abbe?s criterion  given by Ernst Abbe in 1873 as ?d =      ?   2n sin? Resolving power =  ?  = 2nsin?          ?d        ?  ? Where n is the refractive index of the medium separating  object and aperture. Note that to achieve high resolution  n sin ? must be large. This is known as the Numerical  aperture. Thus, for good resolution:  ? sin ? must be large.  ? To achieve this, the objective lens is kept as close to the  specimen as possible.  ? A higher refractive index (n) medium must be used. Oil  immersion microscopes use oil to increase the refractive  index.  ? Decreasing the wavelength by using X-rays and gamma  rays. While these techniques are used to study inorganic  crystals, biological samples are usually damaged by  x-rays and hence are not used. 42."

When you keep a cover slip over this chamber, the depth  is 0.1mm  ? So the total volume is 1X1X 0.1mm 3 = 0.1mm3 or ul  Calculation:  ? Concentration of cells = n/v xd  ? Where (n = number of cells, V = volume, d = dilution)  ? Coming back to the question: total number of cells in the  4 squares (a, c, g,i) = 35 + 25 + 40 + 20 = 120  ?
