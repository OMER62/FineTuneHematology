"All of the following are the normal hemostasic response to vascular 
injury, except:
a. Endothelium 
b. Stasis of blood flow
c. Platelets 
d. Coagulation factors","Ans. b. Stasis of blood flow 
Ref: Hoffbrand 5/e p783
The  hemostatic system is a complex mosaic of activating or inhibitory 
feedback or feed-forward pathways, integrating its five major components.

"Which of these statements is not true regarding platelets?
a. During maturation megakaryocytes undergoes endomitotic nuclear 
division
b. Thrombopoietin is mainly produced by liver
c. Lifespan of platelets is 7–10 days
d. They extrude their nucleus before forming mature platelets","Ans. d. They extrude their nucleus before forming mature platelets 
 
Ref: William’s 8/e p238, 1721, 1722, 1724, 1726
Endomitosis is the characteristic feature of megakaryocyte development 
in which the DNA is repeatedly replicated in absence of nuclear or 
cytoplasmic division. Megakaryocyte is the cell where endomitosis begins.  
Thrombopoietin being the primary regulator of megakarocyte maturation 
is mainly produced by liver, though some amount is also produced by 
kidney, marrow stroma and skeletal muscle. The circulatory life span of 
platelet is approximately 10 days with normal platelet count, but shorter 
in patients with moderate (7 days) to severe (5 days) thrombocytopenia. 
Mature platelets are formed as proplatelet from megakaryocytes. Nucleus 
is not extruded from megakaryocyte."

"One unit of random donor platelet ideally increases the platelet count 
in an adult by:
a. 5000 
b. 10000
c. 15000 
d. 20000","Ans. a. 5000 
Ref: William 8/e p2306
The increment in platelet count depends on many factors but if all other 
factors are absent then 1 unit of whole blood derived random platelet 
increases the platelet count by 5,000/mm3 per square metre.  So in a 
person of BSA 2 m2 it should raise by 10000/mm3 and of 1.5 m2 by 7500/
mm3 respectively."
"Most specific test in diagnosing HIT:
a. ELISA 
b. Serotonin release assay
c. Prolonged PT/APTT 
d. Prothrombin fragment 1.2 level","Ans. b. Serotonin release assay 
Ref: William’s 8/e p2176
Thrombocytopenia is the key laboratory finding in HIT and ranges from 
20 to 100 thousand/mm3 or 50–70% decline from baseline. For confirming 
diagnosis two assay prototypes are available. One is ELISA based for 
detection of Ig antibodies to heparin–PF4 complexes and the other 
measure heparin–dependent antibodies that activate platelets. Activation 
assays are not available commercially because specific platelet donors are 
needed each time and donor platelets vary greatly in their sensitivity to 
activation by HIT sera. 14C–serotonin release assay is the best established 
activation assay. As compared to antigen assay, activation assays have 
greater specificity.  The risk status for HIT can be assessed by 4Ts.

In TTP PT/APTT and fibrinogen levels are usually normal or only mild 
perturbed.  Mild elevations in fibrin degradation products occur in 50% 
of patients."
"Falsely low platelets (pseudothrombocytopenia) is seen in all except:
a. EDTA
b. Presence of giant platelets
c. Multiple myeloma
d. Heparin","Ans. d. Heparin 
Ref: William’s 8/e p1892
Pseudothrombocytopenia has been reported in association with the use 
of EDTA as an anticoagulant, with platelet cold agglutinins associated 
with multiple myeloma, platelet satellitism, giant platelets and platelet 
agglutination.  Other anticoagulants such as sodium citrate, oxalate, acid 
citrate dextrose and heparin can also cause platelet agglutination but is 
less frequent."
"Which of the following is not a first line therapy in ITP?
a. IVIg 
b. Anti-D
c. Rituximab 
d. Steroids","Ans. c. Rituximab 
Ref: William’s 8/e p1906-08
IVIg, anti-D and steroids are the first line treatment options given in ITP. 
Rituximab is usually given in cases of chronic ITP who fail to steroids."
"Which of the following is not true regarding post transfusion 
purpura?
a. It is most commonly due to anti HPA-1a antibodies
b. Usually develops after 3 weeks of blood transfusion
c. The treatment of choice is IVIg
d. Even HLA matched platelets are not useful","Ans. b. Usually develops after 3 weeks of blood transfusion 
 
Ref: Hoffman 5/e p2095-2096
The typical patient is a multiparous, middle aged or elderly female who 
presents with the acute onset of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia, 
a mean of 6–8 days (range 1–14 days) after receiving a blood product 
containing platelet material. Sera of more than 90% of patients contain 
antibodies to HPA-1a which is expressed on 97–98% of Caucasians. 
Bleeding usually lasts for 10 days, but can persist for 60–120 days with 
fatality rates of 10%. The treatment of choice is IVIg 1g/kg/day × 2 days. 
More than 90% of patients respond within 2-3 days.  HLA matched platelets 
are generally not useful."
"Bernard – Soulier syndrome is characterized by all except:
a. Low platelet count
b. Giant platelets
c. Aggregation with ristocetin
d. Has defect in GPIb/IX","Ans. c. Aggregation with ristocetin 
Ref: William’s 8/e p1944-1945
Thrombocytopenia is present in nearly all patients and ranges from 20,000 
to near–normal levels.  Platelets are large and small.  The hallmark of BSS is 
the failure of platelets to aggregate in response to ristocetin or botrocetin. 
BSS platelets are deficient in GPIb, GPIX and GPV."
"In TTP, anemia is due to:

"Which of the following is true about von Willebrand factor?
a. It cross links platelet to each other
b. It is functional in large multimeric form
c. Plasma VWF is derived from platelets
d. It carries factor IX","Ans. b. It is functional in largest multimeric form 
 
 
Ref: Hoffman 5/e p1954-1956
VWF attaches platelets to the endothelium and vessel walls and not 
the platelets to each other. The most potent form of VWF is the large 
multimeric form. The Endothelium secretes VWF by one of the two 
pathways.  The constitutive pathway–directly coupled to VWF synthesis 
and occurs without stimulation and the regulated pathway–involving VWF 
stored in Weibel–Palade bodies, is initiated by the action of secretagogues. 
VWF secreted by the constitutive pathway is in the largest multimeric 
form. The constitutive secretion of VWF from endothelium maintains 
the Plasma VWF level. During activation after tissue injury, it is released 
from the Weibel–Palade bodies of and α-granules of platelet.  VWF carries 
factor VIII and not IX."
"Which of the following does not inhibit platelet activation?
a. Ecto-ADPase 
b. Prostacyclins
c. Nitric oxide 
d. ADP","Ans. d. ADP 
Ref: William’s 8/e p1788-1789

"Which of the following is not a risk factor for disseminated intra­
vascular clotting (DIC)?
a. Amniotic fluid embolism
b. Snake bite
c. Abruptio placentae
d. Major orthopedic surgery","1835, Hoffman 5/e p1826
The formation of a factor VIIa/TF complex at the site of injury is the 
major initiating event in hemostasis in vivo.  The factor VIIa/TF complex 
can activate both factor IX and X.  TF is normally expressed on pericytes 
around blood vessel and by epidermal, stromal and glial cells. In Contrast 
to other proenzymes, factor VII circulates in the blood in two forms: the 
inactive zymogen factor VII and the active form VIIa. The concentration 
of factor VIIa is low but sufficient to generate significant factor X–with 
the help of tissue factor.

"Macrothrombocytopenia is characteristically seen in all, except:
a. Bernard-Soulier syndrome
b. Gray-platelet syndrome
c. May-Hegglin anomaly
d. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome","Ans. d. Gammaglobuliermia 
Ref: Dacie & Lewis 10/e p111 – 112
Pseudothrombocytopenia is seen with giant platelets (macro thrombo-
cytopenia) which is seen most commonly in West Bengal, India. In 
about 1% of individuals, EDTA causes platelet clumping, resulting 
in pseudothrombocytopenia. Occasionally platelets may be seen 
adhering to neutrophils (platelet satellitism). Presence of platelet cold 
agglutinins is seen with multiple myeloma.  GP IIb/IIIa antagonists (e.g. 
abciximab) is associated with both pseudothrombocytopenia and true 
thrombocytopenia.  Antiphospholipid antibodies are also associated with 
pseudothrombocytopenia."
"Which of the following is not true about Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome?
a. Thrombocytopenia
b. Autosomal recessive
c. Small platelets
d. Eczema
e. Platelet dysfunction to various agonists","Ans. d. Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome 
 
 
Ref: William’s 8/e p1894, 1896, 1948, 1944
May–Hegglin anomaly, Fechtner syndrome, Sebastian syndrome and 
Epstein syndrome are autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia with 
mutations in the MYH9 gene.  Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome is a rare X-linked 
immunodeficiency disorder characterized by microthrombocytopenia, 
eczema, recurrent infections, T-cell deficiency and increased risk for 
autoimmune and lympho proliferative disorders.  Platelets appear larger 
than normal, pale ghost like, oval forms on blood smear in Gray–platelet 
syndrome.  Thrombocytopenia is common and can be moderately severe. 
In Bernard-Soulier syndrome, thrombocytopenia is present in nearly all 
patients, but is variable in its severity, ranging from approximately 20,000/
mm3 to normal levels."

"Maternal serum will most likely show:
a. Antibodies to HIV
b. Anti HPA-1a antibodies
c. Platelet auto antibodies
d. Anti HLA antibodies","Ans. b. Anti­HPA­1a antibodies 
 
 
Ref: William’s 8/e p1912, BJH -152, p 460-468
This patient is a case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) 
so maternal serum will show anti–platelet antibodies which is most 
commonly against anti–HPA-1a antigen (78%) in whites. However in 
Asians most common is HPA-4a (80%).  It is very important to differentiate 
between maternal ITP and NAIT and the features are
Maternal ITP
NAIT
• Rarely have severe thrombocyto-
penia or bleeding manifestation 
in fetus
• Maternal platelet count is low
• Thrombocytopenia is severe 
and intracranial hemorrhage 
rate is higher (10–20%)
• Maternal platelet count is normal
NAIT is like Rh hemolytic disease of newborn but the first born child is 
affected in 40-60% of cases (which is spared in Rh hemolytic disease of 
newborn).  Platelet count recovers to normal in 1–2 weeks.  The diagnosis is 
usually confirmed by tests for circulating maternal alloantibodies against 
fetal antigens (usually by MAIPA) or by platelet typing of the parents and 
neonate by genotyping or ELISA.
Postnatal management: Options are IVIg, glucocorticoids and platelet 
transfusions.  In severe bleeding, platelets can be transfused and should 
be ABO and (Rh) D compatible and HPA-1a negative.
Prenatal management: In high-risk NAIT weekly IVIg/administration 
with or without glucocorticoids. In severe thrombocytopenia fetuses, 
early delivery with caesarean Section may reduce ICH."

of large patches of discolored stain over his gluteal region and legs.  
This complication is most likely the result of:
a. Antithrombin III deficiency
b. Protein C deficiency
c. Drug allergy
d. Very high INR","Ans. b. Protein C deficiency 
Ref: William’s 8/e p355-356
This is a case of warfarin induced skin necrosis, a rare complication of 
warfarin therapy that occur early in the case of anticoagulation.  Typical 
complaints are burning and tingling at the affected site, which usually 
involves a region with a large amount of subcutaneous tissue, such as 
breast, buttock or thigh.  Painful hemorrhagic full thickness skin infarction 
develops and frequently required skin grafting.  Thrombosis in dermal 
and subdermal venules is the underlying cause and this may be caused 
by disproportionately rapid reduction in protein C and S, in concert with 
relatively preserved levels of Factor II and X that are seen early in warfarin 
treatment."

Ref: J. Clin Invert 001:10.1172 / JC134957, Venous thrombosis and 
Pulmonary embolism, Michnael Hume, P–76) (William’s 8/e p2122)
Thrombosis and embolism has also been implicated as secondary to 
diabetes mellitus, gout, smoking, administration of ACTH, but these 
cannot yet be substantiated as predisposing causes. Male sex has also 
been implicated as predisposing risk factor which may be related to 
differences in the way they secrete growth hormone and its effect on 
liver gene expression.  Men secrete GH not in pulses and women secrete 
it in pulses. GH controls the production of coagulation protein by liver, 
the differences in secretion may be related to differences in clotting and 
thrombosis risk. Hypohomocysteinemia, definitely is not a risk factor 
for thrombosis."

"Which one of these is not an advantage of LMWH over UFH?
a. There is a reduced risk of osteoporosis
b. Has a half life of 30 min so effect can be easily reversed
c. Dosing does not require monitoring by blood test
d. Does not require continuous infusion","Ans. b. Has a half life of 30 min so the effect can be easily reversed 
 
Ref: William’s 8/e p357 – 358
Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have a longer half-life than 
unfractionated heparins, so can be given once or twice daily subcutaneous 
injection. LMWHs show less binding to plasma proteins and cells, and 
thus have more predictable blood levels and anticoagulant effect.  Dose 
to be adjusted in renal insufficiency since LMWHs have renal clearance. 
Protamine sulfate does not completely reverse the anticoagulant effect of 
LMWH, so can be given in overdose but is partially effective. It has been 
shown by animal and small clinical studies that osteoporosis may be less 
common with LMWH.  Normally dosing does not require monitoring by 
blood test. Monitoring by anti Xa level is done in obesity, renal failure, 
trauma, ischemic stroke, or h/o GI bleeding. Also in pregnancy and 
children. Smaller risk of heparin induced thrombocytopenia."

Thrombosis 
• When LA is found in association with severe prothrombin deficiency or 
thrombocytopenia (< 20,000) treatment with steroids is indicated and 
if actively bleeding with severe hypoprothrombinemia.  IVIg should be 
added and if patient is actively bleeding with severe thrombocytopenia

• When LA, ACLA or anti-B2 GPI are found without any evidence 
of thrombosis or fetal loss treatment is not indicated.  However 
prophylactic low dose aspirin and or hydrochloroquine plus aggressive 
treatment of comorbid conditions such as smoking, DM, HTN, 
dyslipidemia.
• For recurrent pregnancy losses prophylactic aspirin 75-81mg/day plus 
LMWH (once a day) or UFH (5000 units BD).  If fetal loss recurs on this 
regimen then therapeutic LMWH (BD dose) or UFH 5000 units s/c TID)

Patients with HIT, particularly with thrombosis have increased thrombin 
generation that can lead to consumption of protein C and thus warfarin 
alone can cause skin necrosis.  If warfarin was administered, give vitamin 
K to restore the INR to normal.

Osmotic fragility has been typically increased in HS and hereditary 
elliptocytosis. There are 2 types of hereditary stomatocytosis: hereditary 
xerocytosis (complex permeability defect d/t increased membrane 
lipids) and hereditary stomatocytosis – hydrocytosis (d/t deficiency of 
band 7.2b or stomatin). Both have autosomal dominant inheritance. OF 
is decreased in xerocytosis and increased in hydrocytosis. Xerocytosis 
may result in recurrent fetal loss, hydrops fetalis, neonatal hepatitis and

presence of antibody coated red cells.  In this the patient’s RBCs are 
taken and mixed with Coomb’s polyspecific (Anti–IgG, Anti–IgM, 
anti–C3c and anti–C3d) sera. ICT or IAT is the test which detects the 
presence of soluble (auto or allo) in the plasma.  In this the patient’s 
plasma is taken and mixed with Coomb’s sera (polyspecific or 
monospecific) with washed normal red cells.
• Majority of red cells antibodies are non-compliment- binding IgG so 
anti-IgG is major component of polyspecific sera.
• Anti-IgA is not required because IgG of same specificity always occur 
simultaneously.
• Anti-IgM is also not required because clinically significant IgM 
alloantibodies which do not agglutinate in saline are much more easily 
detected by complement.
• EDTA prevents complement activation, so if plasma is used only anti-
IgG is necessary.
• Labs using other than NISS (normal ionic strength saline) such as LISS,

disease?
a. Neutrophils
b. Nitric oxide
c. Platelets and coagulation factors
d. Free hemoglobin","Ans. c. Platelets and coagulation factor 
Ref: William’s 8/e p711-715
The pathophysiologic processes that lead to sickle cell disease related 
complications result from a combination of hemolysis and vaso-occlusion. 
Hemolysis occurs as a result of repeated episodes of hemoglobin 
polymerization/depolymerization as sickle red blood cells pick up and 
release oxygen in the circulation. Red blood cell membranes become 
abnormal from this process and red blood cells have a shortened lifespan. 
Hemolysis can occur both chronically and during acute painful vaso-
occlusive crises and also results in the release of substantial quantities 
of free hemoglobin into the vasculature. The consumption of significant 
quantities of nitric oxide (NO) by this resultant free ferrous hemoglobin, 
in turn, leads to abnormal regulation in vascular homeostasis. Moreover, 
neutrophils play a key role in the tissue damage which occurs as both 
neutrophil numbers are increased and evidence suggests that they are 
abnormally activated and adherent. Likewise, as suggested by recent 
51

data sickle red cells induce adhesion of lymphocytes and monocytes 
to the endothelium such that these may contribute to the pathogenesis 
of vascular occlusion. Platelet activation also occurs in SCD but is least

common triggers for vaso-occlusive crises. However, often no identifiable 
cause is found and pain often occurs without warning. Painful events are 
unpredictable and often severe resulting in repeated hospitalizations, 
missed days of school or work, and very poor health-related quality of 
life as well as an increased mortality rate."
"True regarding acute chest syndrome is:

b. Risk of mortality increases
c. Hydroxyurea is indicated
d. Pulmonary hypertension is an important cause","Ans. d. Pulmonary hypertension is an important cause  
 
Ref: William’s 8/e p718 
The specific definition of what constitutes acute chest syndrome (ACS) 
varies but usually refers to a new pulmonary infiltrate accompanied by 
fever and/or symptoms or signs of respiratory disease in a patient with 
sickle cell disease (SCD). It is a relatively common cause of frequent 
hospitalizations and death and a common indication for transfusion and 
treatment with hydroxyurea. The etiology of ACS is multi-factorial and 
not completely understood. Although many episodes of ACS develop 
without an obvious cause, previous studies indicate that infection, fat 
emboli, and pulmonary infarction are all commonly associated with 
its development. Treatment usually involves antimicrobials to cover 
both common causes of pneumonia such as Streptococcus pnuemoniae 
and Chlamydia pneumoniae as well as atypical pathogens such as 
mycoplasma. Chronic pulmonary problems seen in SCD are restrictive 
and obstructive lung disease, hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension. 
Pulmonary hypertension is more frequent among patients with high rates 
of chronic hemolysis, reﬂected by marked elevation in plasma lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH). Pulmonary hypertension is not the cause of ACS

Ref: William’s 8/e p 719 
Central nervous system disease is common in sickle cell disease and 
usually manifests as stroke and/or vasculopathy in those with the disease. 
Overt stroke usually involves large cerebral vessels that affect large regions 
of the brain and occurs in up to 10% of children with the disease. Silent 
stroke which occurs in at least 22% of those with sickle cell disease, is 
defined as an infarct on imaging studies with a normal neurological

c. Cdk phosphorylates the protein targets
d. Cyclin proteins are formed during specific phases","Ans. a. DNA replication occurs in G1 phase 
Ref: Hoffman 5/e p63–66
Interphase is the phase of cell cycle in which the cell spends majority of 
its time and performs the majority of its purposes including preparation 
for cell division.  There are 3 stages of interphase:
G1 (Gap 1) in which the cell grows and functions normally.  During this 
time much protein systhesis occurs and the cell grows, organelles are 
produced.  If the cell is not to divide again, it will remain in this phase.
S (Synthesis) phase, in which the cell duplicates its DNA (via 
semiconserative replication). Also called Swanson phase.
G2 (Gap 2), in which the cell resumes its growth in preparation for cell 
division.  Some cells do not divide often or ever, enter a Go (Gap zero) 
stage, which is either a stage separate from interphase or an extended 
G1 phase, which follows the restriction point (a cell cycle check point at 
the end of G1).  Examples are terminally differentiated cells viz Neuron, 
Myocyte, neutrophils ets.  
Remember, M (Mitotic phase) has 4 stages–Prophase, Metaphase, 
Anaphase and telophase.
Resting antigen–specific lymphocytes are in G0 phase until antigen and 
cytokine stimulation induces them to proliferate.
Cell cycle is regulated by the phosphorylation of various cyclin dependent 
kinases and these cyclins appear and disappear at different phases of 
cell cycle."
"Which is true regarding apoptosis?
a. Caspases are the ultimate effectors of apoptosis
b. FAS and TNF–R have an extracellular death domain
c. BCL–2 is a proapoptotic protein
d. Entry of cytochrome C into mitochondria is a critical step","Ans. a. Caspases are the ultimate effectors of apoptosis 
 
 
Ref: William’s 7/e p151–153
Activation of caspases constitutes an irreversible event and the caspases 
are the ultimate effectors of apoptotic cell destruction. A key role is played 
by mitochondria in the regulation of apoptosis and cytochrome from inner 
mitochondrial membrane (electron transport chain) and is released into 
the cytosol. Where it may participate in caspase activation.
 
There are multiple pathways through which activation of caspases may 
occur  but 2 are marked out in detail:
• Receptor mediated: Fas or TNF-α receptor.  Binding of the these 
receptors by their respective ligands cause recruitment of cystolic 
adapter molecule called Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or 
TNFR–associated activates the effective caspase"

been shown by many studies that Transferrin Receptor/log of ferritin is 
more accurate in differentiating between IDA and ACD (Blood 89: 1052,

Ref: William’s 8/e p743 -747
Methemoglobinemia is due to abnormal Hb and NADH-diaphorase 
deficiency which is autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive, 
respectively. Can be misinterpreted when automated instruments 
designed to estimate levels of reduced Hb, oxygenated Hb, Met Hb and 
Carboxy Hb are used. Direct spectrophotometric analysis is required to 
diagnose methemoglobinemia or sulphemoglobinemia. For hereditary 
methemoglobinemia due to NADH diaphorase deficiency, treatment 
is ascorbic acid, 300–600 mg/day. Acute toxic methemoglobinemia is 
treated with methylene blue. NADPH rapidly reduces Methylene blue 
to Leukomethylene blue which nonenzymatically reduce Met Hb to Hb. 
Dose is 1–2 mg/kg over 5 min for rapid action. Cimetidine is a selective 
inhibitor of M-hydroxylation, so it is used in methemoglobinemia 
produced by dapsone.  Unlike methemoglobinemia sulph hemoglobin 
cannot be converted to Hb."

most of the hemoglobin M, tyrosine has been substituted for either the 
proximal or the distal histidine. This results in reduced capacity of the 
enzymatic machinery of the erythrocyte to efficiently reduce the iron to 
the divalent form and thus predisposes to methemoglobinemia. These 
hemoglobin variants are associated with cyanosis, which is present from 
early life."
"Clinical manifestations of methemoglobinemia include:
a. Cyanosis
b. Hemolysis
c. Normal PaO2 in arterial blood gas analysis
d. All of the above","Ans. d. All of the above        
Ref: William’s 8/e p745
Methemoglobinemia may be acute or chronic. The physiologic level of 
methemoglobin in the blood is 0% to 2%. Methemoglobin concentrations 
of 10% to 20% are tolerated well, but levels above this are often associated 
with symptoms. Levels above 70% may cause death. Symptoms also 
depend on the rapidity of its formation. Many patients with lifelong 
methemoglobinemia are asymptomatic, but patients exposed to drugs 
and toxins who abruptly develop the same levels of methemoglobinemia 
may be severely symptomatic. Dyspnea, nausea, and tachycardia occur at 
methemoglobin levels of 30% or more. Lethargy, stupor, and deteriorating 
consciousness occur as methemoglobin levels approach 55%. Higher 
levels may cause cardiac arrhythmias and circulatory failure. Drug-
induced methemoglobinemia may be followed by Hemolytic anemia 
especially with exposure to dapsone, sulfasalazine, or phenacetin. Heinz 
bodies (precipitated hemoglobin or globin subunits due to denaturation of 
hemoglobin in erythrocytes) and fragmented red blood cells characterise 
this type of anemia. Acute intravascular hemolysis may occasionally lead 
to renal failure. Blood containing high concentrations of methemoglobin 
appears chocolate brown. Subjects with methemoglobinemia may 
have normal partial pressures of oxygen, despite life-threatening 
methemoglobinemia. The oxygen saturation values, measured by a pulse 
oximeter, are falsely elevated."

a. Exchange transfusion
b. Hyperbaric oxygen
c. Methylene blue
d. Dialysis","Ans. c. Methylene blue      
  Ref: William’s 8/e p747
The possible diagnosis of methemoglobinemia should be suspected 
because the patient is cyanosed, the cyanosis is unresponsive to 
ventilation, there is no prior history of respiratory problems, and the 
patient had been exposed to a topical anesthetic that is known to cause 
methemoglobinemia. Cyanosis, low hemoglobin oxygen saturation

spectrum of methemoglobin), normal PaO2 on ABG, “chocolate blood”. 
(Methemoglobinemia does not change color with the addition of oxygen 
whereas dark blood due to deoxyhemoglobin will turn red with oxygen). 
Co-oximetry of ABG will quantify the percent of methemoglobinemia in 
a fresh arterial sample. For methemoglobinemia due to drug exposure, 
traditional first-line therapy consists of an infusion of methylene blue (1%; 
73
Methemoglobinemia
1–2 mg/kg IV over 5 minutes), whose action depends on the availability 
of reduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotide phosphate (NADPH) 
within the red blood cells. After an acute exposure to an oxidizing agent, 
treatment should be considered when the methemoglobin is 30% in 
an asymptomatic patient and 20% in a symptomatic patient. Patients 
with anemia or cardiorespiratory problems should be treated at lower 
levels of methemoglobin. Dextrose should be given  because the major 
source of NADH in the red blood cells is the catabolism of sugar through 
glycolysis. Dextrose is also necessary to form NADPH through the 
hexose monophosphate shunt, which is necessary for methylene blue 
to be effective. Exchange transfusion is reserved for patients in whom 
methylene blue therapy is ineffective."

"Which one of the following is a feature of chronic extravascular 
hemolysis?
a. Raised serum conjugated bilirubin
b. Low reticulocyte count
c. Hypocellular bone marrow

"Which of the following is not a cause of intravascular hemolysis?
a. Rh incompatibility
b. ABO incompatibility
c. G6PD deficiency
d. Red cell fragmentation syndrome","Ans. a. Rh incompatibility 
Ref: William’s 8/e p451, 452, 2265
Intravascular destruction occurs if the red cell membrane is breached 
in the circulation which occurs in ABO incompatibility, PNH, Prosthetic 
valve hemolysis, Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. It also occurs in 
anti-Jka and anti-Jkb antibodies. ABO, anti-Jka and anti-Jkb antibodies 
is strongly expressed on RBC and these antibodies bind complement 
efficiently. Intravascular hemolysis is also caused by G6PD and other 
enzyme abnormalities .
Extravascular hemolysis occurs when the red cells become damaged 
or senescent which result in decreased deformability and/or altered 
surface properties. Deformibility is decreased in HS, HE, AIHA (due to 
decreased surface to volume ratio) and in SCD and Hb C disease (the 
internal viscosity of the cell is increased). Altered surface properties of 
RBC membrane can be altered by binding of antibodies, complements 
and by chemical alteration (particularly oxidative damage to membrane 
components as occurs in Sickle Cell and thalassemic cells). Extravascular 
hemolysis occurs with IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies that react at body 
temperature and is seen in Rh, Kidd, kell, Duffy or Ss antigen."
"A 10 years old child presented with severe hemolytic anemia after 
febrile illness. There is marked reticulocytosis and LDH of 10,000 IU/
ml.  Characteristically, his total Bilirubin is 0.3 with direct fraction 
of 0.2 mg/dL.  The most like diagnosis is: 
a. Heme oxygenase deficiency
b. Ferrochelatase deficiency
c. Biliverdin reductase
d. ALA dehydratase","Ans. a. Heme oxygenase deficiency
For this the process of heme degradation needs to be understood first. In 
extravascular hemolysis RBCs are degraded within the macrophages so 
Hb is not released free into the plasma and that is why, hemoglobinuria 
or hemoglobinemia are not seen in extravascular hemolysis. Hb breaks 
down to Heme and globin in macrophages.  In lysosomes globin is broken 
into amino acids. Oxidation of porphyrin ring of heme by microsomal 
heme oxygenase produces biliverdin and CO, and releases Fe3+ which may 
get incorporated in Transferrin or stored in Ferritin. With time Ferritin 
in excess may be oxidized and degraded to hemosiderin. Biliverdin 
is reduced by biliverdin reductase to unconjugaetd bilirubin (water 
insoluble). It is released into plasma where it can bind to albumin or 
hemopexin. From them it is taken by hepatocytes for conjugation.
The above mentioned case is having defect in bilirubin synthesis and is 
classically seen in heme oxygenase-1 deficiency. Heme oxygenase has 
2 isoenzymes; HO-1 (inducible) and HO-2 (constitutive). First case of 
human HO-1 deficiency was described in 1999 and is characterized by 
hemolysis (endothelial damage) and DIC. It may also be associated with 
congenital asplenia and nephritis.
Recent studies have shown that bilirubin has cytoprotectant effects by 
having antioxidant properties.

d. Gel card is not able to detect rare IgA only AIHA","Ans. d. Gel card is not able to detect rare IgA only AIHA 
 
 
Ref: Dacie & Lewis 10/e p248–249
Polyspecific AHG contains antibodies against IgG and C3d complement 
so it will not be able to detect IgA or IgM autoantibody type AIHA. The 
incidence of IgA only warm AIHA is 0.2 to 2.7%.  2–6% of patients with 
clinical and hematological features of AIHA, have DCT negative on 
repeated testing.
Low-affinity IgG autoantibodies dissociate from RBC during washing 
phase in tube technique, resulting in negative DCT.
Low-titre IgG autoantibodies (threshold is 300–4000 molecules per RBC) 
may also be missed in tube technique. In these cases positive DCT may 
be demonstrated by more sensitive technique eg. column agglutination 
method, ELISA or flow cytometry.
The DiaMed DAT gel card, which contains a set of monospecific AHG 
reagents (i.e. anti-IgG, -IgA, -IgM, -C3c, -C3d and inert control) can also 
be used. There is no washing phase in this, so it detects low affinity IgG, 
IgA and IgM. A gel card can also pick up the rare IgA-only AIHA.

"Intracellular destruction of proteins can occur by all of the following, 
except:
a. Lysosome
b. Proteasome
c. Spliceosome
d. Aggresome","Ans. c. Spliceosome
Lysosome are the cytoplasmic organelle where the intracellular destruc-
tion of endogenous or exogenous proteins occur.  The other pathway of 
intracellular destruction of proteins occurs through the usual ubiquitin-
proteasome system. An aggresome is a proteinacious inclusion body 
of abnormal or mutant protein in the cytoplasm which fails to be 
eliminated by the proteasome pathway. Aggresome forms around the 
microtubule organizing center in eukayotic cells. Substrates are targeted 
to the aggresome by an ubiquitin independent pathway mediated by 
stress induced co-chaperon BAG 3 (Bcl-2 associated athanogene 3). The 
aggresome is eventually targeted for autophagic clearance for the cell. 
Some pathological proteins cannot be degraded and cause the aggresome 
to form inclusion bodies, e.g. Levy bodies, Mallory’s Hyaline.
A splicesome is a complex of snRNA and protein subunits that removes 
introns from a transcribed pre-MRNA (hnRNA) segment. This process 
is called intron splicing. The snRNAs that make up nuclear spliceosome 
are named V1, V2, V4, V5 and V"

Osmotic fragility is decreased in thalassemia because of unusually 
flattened RBCs (leptocytes) which are present in thalassemia. The osmotic 
fragility is decreased since these cells are resistant to osmotic lysis. The 
remaining 3 features are characteristically seen in thalassemia if they are

"The most common cause of beta thalassemia is:
a. Point mutation
b. Insertion
c. Deletion
d. All are equally distributed","Ans. a. Point mutation 
Ref: Hoffman 6/e p506 
The vast majority of beta thalassaemia mutations are point mutations 
(i.e. single-base substitutions) and small insertions or deletions of one 
to two bases. These may involve any step in globin chain production: 
transcription, translation or post-translational modification of the globin 
gene product. The beta gene is completely inactivated by approximately 
half of these mutations with no beta globin production resulting in beta 
0 thalassaemia. Mutations that allow the production of some beta globin 
cause beta + or beta ++ thalassaemia depending on whether there is a 
marked or mild reduction in the output of beta chains. The five common 
mutations -IVS 1-5 G → C, IVS 1 -1 G → T, Codon 41/42 (- TCTT), Codon 
8/9 and the 619 bp deletion account for over 90% of the mutations in 
beta-thalassemia patients. The most common beta-thalassemia allele in 
the Indian population is IVS-I-5 (G → C)."
"The most common cause of alpha thalassemia is:
a. Point mutation
b. Insertion
c. Deletion
d. All are equally distributed","Ans. c. Deletion 
Ref: Hoffman 6/e p530 
Alpha thalassemia occurs because of mutation leading to reduced 
production of one or more of the four alpha globin chains. Generally, the 
alpha globin chains are structurally normal but are produced in reduced 
quantities. Most alpha thalassemia mutations result in gene deletion; with 
nondeletional point mutations being less common. As a result of deletions 
there is a loss of alpha globin chains. The larger the deletions the more is 
the loss of alpha globin genes (from 1 to 4 alpha chains), the more severe 
the thalassemia. Molecular analysis of DNA using PCR has now replaced 
hemoglobin H inclusion test. The PCR test can also identify nondeletional 
point mutations leading to alpha plus thalassemia."
"True in beta thalassemia are all, except:
a. Reduced beta chain production
b. Increased delta chain production
c. Increased alpha chain production
d. Increased gamma chain production
e. All of the above","Ans. c. Increased alpha chain production Ref: William’s 6/e p696-698 
The molecular defects in beta thalassaemia result in absent or reduced 
beta chain production while alpha chain synthesis is unaffected. The 
imbalance in globin chain production leads to an excess of alpha chains. 
The free alpha globin chains are highly unstable and precipitate in red 
cell precursors, forming intracellular inclusions that interfere with red cell 
maturation. Those red cells which mature and enter the circulation contain 
alpha chain inclusions that interfere with their passage through the 
microcirculation, particularly in the spleen. Cells which make relatively 
more gamma chains in the bone marrow of beta thalassaemics are partly 
protected against the deleterious effect of alpha chain precipitation. The 
F cells which produce the gamma chains come under selection in the 
marrow and peripheral blood and thus individuals with beta thalassaemia 
have variable increases in HbF due to selective survival of these F cells. 
The disorder is characterized by a relative or absolute increase in HbA2 
(alpha2delta2) production since delta chain synthesis is unaffected.

d. Variable effects","Ans. b. Decreases the severity of symptoms Ref: William’s 6/e p693-694 
Co-inheritance of alpha thalassaemia reduces chain imbalance and 
disease severity in individuals who have inherited two copies of beta

b. Whole blood should be preferred
c. Leukocyte depleted blood should be preferred
d. All of the above","Ans. b. Whole blood should be preferred 
Ref: William’s 6/e p700-701 
The aim of regular transfusions is to correct anaemia and suppress the

every 2–4 weeks, with a post-transfusion haemoglobin target of 13–15 g/

d. All of the above are true","Ans. b. Serum hepcidin levels are high 
 
Ref: William’s 6/e p700-701, Thalassemia International  
Federation guidelines 
Each unit of transfused blood contains about 200–250 mg iron (about 1 
mg per ml), compared with the 1 mg iron normally absorbed each day. 
Despite the increased iron, serum hepcidin remains inappropriately low, 
which further contributes to iron loading through increased intestinal 
iron absorption. Iron is initially stored in macrophages within the liver, 
and is transferred around the body bound to transferrin. As transferrin 
becomes saturated, labile, more toxic forms of iron appear in cells and 
plasma, referred to as non transferrin bound iron (NTBI). This NTBI 
is responsible for most of the iron toxicity, including iron loading into 
cardiac and endocrine tissues. Once in cells, the iron causes oxidative

"Marked clinical variability in hemoglobin E-beta thalassaemia is due

c. Serum erythropoietin in response to anaemia
d. Associated Xmnl polymorphism
e. All of the above","Ans. e. All of the above 
Ref: Weatherall DJ, Clegg JB. The Thalassemia syndromes, 4/e, Oxford,  
UK Blackwell Sciences Ltd, 2001, Premawardhena A, et al. Lancet 2001
Hb E/beta -thalassaemia results from co-inheritance of a beta-
thalassaemia allele from one parent and the structural variant Hemoglobin 
E from the other. Hemoglobin E results from a G→A substitution in 
codon 26 of the β globin gene, which produces a structurally abnormal 
hemoglobin. The disorder is characterized by marked clinical variability, 
ranging from a mild and asymptomatic anaemia to a life-threatening 
disorder requiring transfusions from infancy. Genetic factors influencing 
the severity of this disorder include the type of beta-thalassaemia 
mutation, the co-inheritance of alpha-thalassaemia, and polymorphisms 
(Xmnl) associated with increased production of foetal haemoglobin. 
Other factors, including a variable increase in serum erythropoietin in 
response to anaemia, previous or ongoing infection with malaria, previous 
splenectomy and other environmental influences, may be involved. A 
modified “natural history” study of Hb E/beta-thalassaemia in children 
highlighted the instability of phenotype over the first ten years of life, 
during which there was a variable, and changing, pattern of anaemia 
and erythroid expansion. In many patients, the phenotype became more 
stable later in development, and it was frequently possible to stop blood 
transfusion in a proportion of older patients with no apparent subsequent 
effects on activities of daily living, or quality of life. Co-inheritance of 
alpha thalassaemia appears to be a major genetic factor modifying 
clinical phenotype, including the finding that a considerable number 
of patients who co-inherit alpha-thalassaemia may be diagnosed later 
in life. The XmnI polymorphism appears to be an important modifying 
factor in haemoglobin F synthesis. Chronic hyperbilirubinaemia, 
gallstone formation, and gall bladder disease may significantly worsen 
the phenotype of patients with Hb E/beta-thalassaemia,  the inherited 
variability in the function of the gene for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1 
(UGT1*1, the enzyme responsible for hepatic glucuronidation of bilirubin) 
may underlie the chronic hyperbilirubinaemia.  Changes in EPO 
responsiveness to severe anaemia may also have important implications 
in Hb E/β-thalassaemia. Premawardhena et al have divided Hb E/beta-
thalassaemia patients into five groups- Group 1 included those patients 
who had undergone only minimal transfusion and had normal growth 
and sexual maturity; group 1 children had adequate growth and all 
101

patients rated quality of life as exceeding 5 on the 10-point scale. Group 
2 comprised patients similar to those in group 1, except for transfusion 
history: these patients had a longer history of transfusions. Group 3 
included patients who had undergone splenectomy with a beneficial 
response and during the two years following splenectomy an improvement 
in quality of life and increase in height velocity were observed. Group 4 
included those patients who, while maintained off transfusions, were 
struggling as evidenced by poor growth, delayed sexual maturation,

"Which one of these is false regarding CDA?
a. WBC and platelet count are normal 
b. Show ineffective erythropoiesis and erythroblast multinuclearity
c. Often triggered by parvovirus infection
d. Anemia is usually first noted in infancy or childhood.","Ans. c. Often triggered by parovirus infection 
 
 
Ref: Hoffman 5/e p351-357
146 Mcqs in Hematology
CDA is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, marrow erythroid 
multinuclearity and secondary hemosiderosis irrespective of transfusional 
iron overload.  Granulopoiesis and thrombopoiesis are normal. Type I and 
Type II are autosomal recessive while Type III is autosomal dominant.
Types of CDA
Type I:  Macrocytosis, megaloblastic erythroid precursors (2–5% 
binucleate forms), internuclear chromatin bridges. Negative Ham test. 
Gene for CDA I is present on chromosome 15 q15 and is called CDAN1 
which encodes Codanin 1 which may be involved in nuclear membrane 
integrity.  80% require blood transfusion during neonatal period. PS shows 
red cell anisopoikilocytosis and occasionally Cabot rings (unique to CDA 
I). EM shows nuclear membrane pore space with cytoplasmic invagination 
into nucleus, spongy appearance of nuclear chromatin.  Interferon alpha 
2a, alpha 2b and Peg IFN alpha 2a should be given in mildly severe or 
moderately severe anemia in CDA I. CDA II do not respond to IFN therapy.
Type II : Normocytic, normoblastic erythroid maturation (10–35% 
binucleate forms), positive Ham test. Abnormality in the glycosylation 
pathway may be the possible etiology. Alpha – Mannosidase II deficiency, 
N-acetyl glucosamyl transferase II deficiency and galactosyl transferase 
deficiency. All 3 deficiency lead to abnormal oligosaccharides on band 3 
on RBC membrane. Magnitude of anemia is usually severe, karyorrhexis 
is common. EM shows double nuclear membrane appearance due to 
excess of ER (Endoplasmic reticulum) parallel to nuclear membrane. 
CDA II cells are lysed by ABO compatible acidified sera of normal patient 
but not from same patient (reverse is seen in PNH). Expression of i and 
I antigens on red cell membrane. Splenomegaly is present and these 
patients respond to splenectomy.
Type III: Type III is most common followed by Type I and then Type II. 
Anemia is mild to moderate. BM shows gaint erythroblasts with upto 12 
nuclei. EM shows nuclear clefts and blebs, autolytic areas in cytoplasm 
and iron-laden mitochondria. Elevated thymidine kinase is found in all 
patients but is normal in siblings.
Type IV – Morphologically Type II but negative Ham test."

"Which of the following is not true about sideroblastic anemia?
a. Maybe inherited
b. It may respond to pyridoxine
c. Maybe caused by folate deficiency
d. Most frequently caused by myelodysplasia","Ans. c. Maybe caused by folate deficiency Ref: Hoffman 5/e p484–486
Sideroblastic anemia is characterized by anemia of varying severity and 
presence of ring sideroblasts (presence of siderotic granules arranged in 
perinuclear distribution around 1/3rd or more of the nucleus). Marrow 
shows erythroid hyperplasia and there is ineffective erythropoiesis 
leading to iron overload. Most sideroblastic anemias are acquired as a 
clonal disorder of erythropoiesis with varying degrees of myelodysplasia. 
Inherited forms are uncommon and occurs in males with X-Linked 
inheritance and is due to the defect in ALAS (ALA synthetase) which 
is corrected by pyridoxine (Cofactor for ALAS). Inherited deficiency of 
Flavin mono-oxygenase is a rare cause of sideroblastic anemia. Typically 
manifests in infancy or childhood. MCV correlates with the degree of 
anemia. They have high serum iron, transferrin saturation and serum 
ferritin levels. Sideroblastic anemia can be differentiated from idiopathic 
by the presence of anemia and low MCV.
A trial of pyridoxine (100–200 mg/day) orally for 3 weeks should be given 
to each patient.  Response rate is 25–50% in heriditary sideroblastic anemia 
and less in acquired form. After response, dose should be titrated with 
100–200 mg/day can lead to peripheral neuropathy.  Unresponsive patient 
require regular blood transfusion with iron chelation. Folate deficiency 
does not cause sideroblastic anemia."
"All of the following are associated with vacuolated erythroblast with 
ring sideroblast in bone marrow, except:
a. Chronic alcoholism
b. Chloramphenicol toxicity
c. Pearson marrow pancreas syndrome
d. Copper deficiency
e. Lead poisioning","Ans. e. Lead poisioning 
Ref: Hoffman 5/e p487 – 488
Ring sideroblasts may be found in BM of malnourished anemic alcoholics. 
Alcohol has direct toxic effect on hematopoiesis. Usually have increased 
MCV and vacuolation of Red cell precursors with RS. RS disappear over 
4–12 days when alcohol is withdrawn.
Chloramphenicol causes reversible suppression of erythropoiesis 
after several days of therapy (this effect is different from idiosyncratic 
aplastic anemia occurring in 1 in 20000 exposed persons). Nearly all 
patients develop vacuolated erythroid RS. It occurs due to inhibition of 
mitochondrial protein synthesis and reduced cytochrome c3 and b levels.
Pearson marrow pancreas syndrome: Also have associated mitochondrial 
myopathy and sideroblastic anemia. Have normocytic normochronic 
anemia with varying degrees of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. BM 
shows vacuolation and sideroblasts.
Copper deficiency also presents with microcytic hypochromic red cells 
with RS and vacuolated erythroid and myeloid precursors in marrow. 
155
Iron Overload and Sideroblastic Anemia
Zinc toxicity can also cause copper deficiency (Zn interferes with copper 
absorption).
In iron deficiency Zn complex of protoporphyrins is produced because 
ferrochelatase uses Zn2+ during iron deficient erythropoiesis.
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels are raised before changes appear in 
peripheral blood and may be helpful in diagnosing iron deficiency when 
serum iron and ferritin levels are rising as a result of iron therapy."

a. High transferrin
b. Low protoporphyrin level
c. High MCV
d. Raised serum hepcidin levels","Ans. a. High serum transferrin 
Ref: William’s 7/e p566, 526
The iron binding capacity is a measure of the amount of transferrin in 
circulating blood. Normally transferrin is about 1/3rd saturated with iron. 
The sum of serum iron and UIBC represents TIBC. In the iron deficiency 
with TIBC and UIBC are increased and the transferrin saturation is 
decreased to less than 15%. Red cell protophyrin levels are increased in 
iron deficiency. Hepicidin levels are raised in anemia of chronic disease 
and are decreased in iron deficiency. IL-6 is a potent inducer of Hepcidin 
and hypoferremia develops within hours of onset of inflammation. 
Hepcidin inhibits release of iron from macrophages (and probably from 
hepatocyte) leading to hypoferremia. Hepcidin does this by ferroportin 
internalization and degradation which is the mediator of release of iron 
into plasma from macrophages, hepatocyte and also enterocytes."

deficiency. Celiac disease (Nontropical sprue) is related to ingestion 
of wheat gluten.  It affects more severely the proximal small intestine.

The earliest specific indicator of folate deficiency is low serum or plasma 
folate.  Raised homocysteine level may precede decline in plasma folate 
level but it can be elevated in other conditions also so it is not specific to 
folate deficiency. A better indicator of the tissue folate status is red cell

a. KIT (CD117) positive
b. Contains tryptase/chymase
c. Mediate IgE dependent hypersensitivity
d. Produce TNFa
e. All of the above","Ans. e. All of the above 
Mast cells are tissue-based inflammatory cells of hematopoietic origin that 
respond to signals of innate and adaptive immunity with immediate and 
delayed release of inflammatory mediators. They are located primarily in 
association with blood vessels and at epithelial surfaces. Mast cells are 
central to the pathogenesis of diseases of immediate hypersensitivity and 
of mastocytosis, but are also implicated in host responses to pathogens, 
autoimmune diseases, fibrosis, and wound healing. Human mast cells are 
divided into 2 major subtypes based on the presence of tryptase (MCT 
cells) or tryptase and mast cell-specific chymase (MCTC cells), each 
predominating in different locations. Tryptase staining identifies all mast 
cells and is the primary method for identifying tissue mast cells. Mast cells 
are KIT (CD117)+ (receptor for stem cell factor [SCF]) and FceR1+; they 
express other cell surface receptors depending on their location and stage 
of differentiation and activation. Mast cells increase in number several-fold 
in association with IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity reactions, 
including rhinitis, urticaria, and asthma; connective tissue disorders, such 
as rheumatoid arthritis; infectious diseases, such as parasites; neoplastic 
diseases, such as lymphoma and leukemia; and osteoporosis, chronic liver 
173

disease, and chronic renal disease. The most striking increase in mast 
cells occurs in parasitic diseases and in mastocytosis (associated with 
gain-of-function mutations in KIT). TNF-a is a major cytokine stored and 
released by mast cells. Mast cells also release histamine which is involved 
in the inflammatory response."

Ref: William’s 8/e p990-992 
Tissue macrophages have a broad role in the maintenance of tissue 
homeostasis, through the clearance of senescent cells and the remodelling 
and repair of tissues after inflammation. They are generally considered 
to be derived from circulating monocytes and show a high degree of 
heterogeneity. The heterogeneity reflects the specialization of function 
that is adopted by macrophages in different anatomical locations, 
including the following: the ability of osteoclasts to remodel bone,  the 
high expression of pattern recognition receptors and scavenger receptors 
by alveolar macrophages,  which are involved in clearing microorganisms, 
viruses and environmental particles in the lungs; and the positioning of 
thymic macrophages  and tingible body macrophages in the germinal 
centre for clearance of apoptotic lymphocytes that are generated during 
the development of an acquired immune response. The gut is one of the 
richest sources of macrophages in the body, and isolation of macrophages 
from the lamina propria has highlighted a unique macrophage phenotype 
that is characterized by high phagocytic and bactericidal activity but 
weak production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This phenotype can be 
induced in peripheral-blood-derived macrophages by intestinal stromal-
cell products, indicating that the tissue microenvironment can markedly 
influence the phenotype of tissue-resident macrophages. Langerhan 
cells are present in epidermis. Kupffer cells are an important component 
of the mononuclear-phagocyte system that is present in the liver. The 
mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) has historically been categorized 
into monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages on the basis of functional 
and phenotypical characteristics. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting 
cells (APCs) which play a critical role in the regulation of the adaptive 
immune response. DCs are capable of capturing antigens, processing 
them, and presenting them on the cell surface along with appropriate 
costimulation molecules.

"True regarding phagocytic killing by macrophages are all, except:
a. NADPH required
b. Respiratory burst
c. Mitochondrial mediated
d. Free hydroxyl radical generated 
e. All of the above are true","Ans. c. Mitochondrial mediated 
Ref: William’s 8/e p999-1005 
Activation of phagocytes is associated with a rapid and dramatic increase 
in oxygen consumption described as the respiratory burst. This process is 
non - mitochondrial and is mediated by the activation of a latent enzyme 
system  referred to as NADPH oxidase, which transfers a single electron 
to molecular oxygen  to form the superoxide anion. The superoxide anion 
then dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), a process occurring either 
spontaneously or through the catalytic function of superoxide dismutase. 
H2 O2 then reacts with superoxide anion, forming the highly reactive 
hydroxyl radical (OH •), which is highly microbicidal."
"The following are associated with neutropenia, except:
a. Hyper-IgM syndrome
b. Reticular dysgenesis
c. Dyskeratosis congenital
d. Leucocyte adhesion deficiency","Ans. d. Leucocyte adhesion deficiency 
Ref: William’s 8/e p966-967 
Leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a congenital disorder that 
presents with persistent leucocytosis, delayed separation of the umbilical 
cord, recurrent infections, impaired wound healing and defects of 
neutrophil activation. The condition is caused by defects in adhesion of 
neutrophils to blood vessel walls. As a result, phagocytes do not migrate 
from the bloodstream to sites of infection. Because of the defect in 
neutrophil migration, abscesses and other sites of infection are devoid of 
pus despite the striking neutrophilia. Reticular dysgenesis is associated 
with neutropenia, lymphoid hypoplasia, and thymic hypoplasia with 
normal erythropoiesis and  megakaryopoiesis. Dyskeratosis congenital is a 
rare disease characterized by abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy 
and mucosal leucoplakia. More than 80% of the affected individuals 
develop bone marrow failure, which is the major cause of death. The 
disorder is caused by defective telomere maintenance in stem cells. 
Neutropenia has been seen with immunological abnormalities such as 
hyper-IgM syndrome and X-linked agammaglobulinaemia. Hyper-IgM 
syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by lymphoid hyperplasia, 
low concentrations of IgG and IgA but high concentration of IgM, and 
severe neutropenia. A genetic defect in the T-cell CD40 ligand has been 
implicated as the cause of the disease."

Hyperviscosity syndrome classically refers to a combination of clinical 
symptoms and physical findings, with laboratory documentation of an 
increased serum viscosity, as measured by Ostwald viscometry.
Symptoms are related to impairment of blood flow in microcirculation 
of the central and peripheral nervous system. Symptoms include 
headache, dizziness, vertigo, nystagmus, hearing loss, visual impairment, 
somnelence, coma and seizure. Other possible findings could be 
mucosal hemorrhage, such as epistaxis, gingival and gastric bleeding 
and congestive heart failure.
Causes of Hyperviscosity syndrome are:
• Increased plasma Ig esp. IgM less commonly IgA, IgG or light chain
• Increased cellular blood components (typically WBCs and RBCs), e.g. 
in leukemias, polycythemia, essential thrombocytosis and the MDS.
• Normal relative serum viscosity ranges from 1.4–1.8 centipoise. 
Symptoms usually are not seen at value < 4 units.
• Clinical symptoms generally are related to the triad of mucosal 
bleeding, visual changes and neurologic symptoms.The tendency 
to bleed is the most common symptom of hyperviscocity syndrome.
Neurological manifestations are referred to as Bins-Neal syndrome. 
Treatment for immediate relief of symptoms are plasmapheresis and

Complications of splenectomy:
• Immediate post operative complications:
 – Bleeding
 – Subphrenic abscesses
• Delayed complications:
 – Overwhelming post – splenectomy infections
 – Thrombocytosis with a risk of thromboembolic incidents
In the immediate post-operative period in uncomplicated splenectomy 
patients, the platelet count rises steeply to a maximum of usually 
6–10 lakhs/mm3 with a peak at 7–12 days. In a number of patients, the 
thrombocytosis persists indefinitely after splenectomy. Although a 
reactive thrombocytosis is not usually associated with thromboembolic 
problems but may sometimes cause pulmonary thromboembolism.
Post Splenectomy Changes:
• Red Cell Changes – Appearance of Howell-Jolly bodies, siderotic 
granules and target cell vacuoles.  Some patients may show irregularly 
contracted or crenated, acanthocytic red cells. Reticulocytes usually 
increase and occasionally RBCs may also be seen. No alteration in 
red cell survival.
• Leukocyte Changes – Rise in total leukocyte count. A neutrophilic 
leukocytosis in the immediate postoperative phase and in majority 
later replaced by significant and permanent increase in both 
lymphocytes and monocytes.
• Platelet Changes – Thrombocytosis is transitory and falls to normal 
values over next 1–2 months but occasional large and bizarre platelets 
can be seen.
• Immunological effects – Fall in IgM fraction is commonly found. IgG

"The following are the risk factors for thrombosis during induction in 
childhood All are, all except:
a. Asparaginase

d. Anthracycline
e. Dexamethasone","Ans. e. dexamethasone 
 
Ref: Blood 2006, Caruso et al  and 
 
British Journal of Haematology, 2007, Jeanette H. Payne 
Most of the thrombotic events occur during the induction phase of 
ALL therapy. In a study by Caruso et al, lower doses of asparaginase 
(ASP) for long periods were associated with the highest incidence 
of thrombosis, as were anthracyclines and prednisone (instead of 
dexamethasone). The presence of central lines and of thrombophilic 
genetic abnormalities also appeared to be frequently associated with 
thrombosis. The cytotoxicity of asparaginase is mediated by depletion of 
the essential amino acid asparagine. In comparison with normal cells, 
lymphoblasts lack the enzyme asparagine synthetase, which makes 
them particularly susceptible. Asparaginase also reduces circulating 
levels of several haemostatic proteins including plasminogen, fibrinogen 
and antithrombin by a combination of reduced hepatic production and 
increased clearance. Prednisolone leads to elevation of factor VIII, VWF, 
prothrombin and antithrombin levels. Although there are no randomised 
studies comparing the haemostatic effects and thrombosis risk associated 
with different glucocorticosteroids, a historical comparison of two BFM 
studies indicated that the risk during induction was much lower with 
dexamethasone than prednisolone."
"True about the use of asparaginase in All is:
a. Increases the risk of thrombosis
b. Increase synthesis of procoagulants
c. PEG-asparaginase use does not reduce the risk of thrombosis
d. All of the above","Ans. d. All of the above 
Asparaginase depletes plasma asparagine, thereby inhibiting protein 
synthesis in leukemic cells and the synthesis of many plasma proteins. The 
latter effect causes deficiencies of albumin, thyroxine-binding globulin, 
and various coagulation proteins, including prothrombin, factors V, 
211
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and 
plasminogen. These deficiencies result in prolongation of the prothrombin 
time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time, 
and hypofibrinogenemia, with levels often less than 100 mg/dL. These 
coagulation abnormalities resolve within one to two weeks after cessation 
of the drug. PEG-asparaginase and L-asparaginase appear to have 
equivalent risk of severe thrombosis."

Cytarabine is converted intracellularly to the active metabolite 
cytarabine triphosphate, it inhibits DNA polymerase by competing with 
deoxycytidine triphosphate resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and is 
incorporated into DNA chain resulting in termination of chain elongation; 
cell cycle-specific for the S-phase of cell division. Cytarabine is indicated 
alone or in combination for induction of remission and/or maintainance

An enlarged kidney can be detected in 30–50% of patients but has 
no prognostic or therapeutic implications. Liver dysfunction due to 
leukaemic infiltration occurs in 10–20% of patients, is usually mild and 
has no important clinical or prognostic consequences. Abnormalities of 
the bone, such as metaphyseal banding, periosteal reactions, osteolysis, 
osteosclerosis or osteopenia, can be revealed by radiography in half of

d. All of the above","Ans. d. All of the above 
Ref. CH Pui, ASH Education program, 2006 
Leukemic blast cells can be detected at diagnosis in the cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) of about one-third of children with ALL. Most of these patients have 
no neurological symptoms. CNS leukemia is defined by the presence of at 
212 Mcqs in Hematology
least five leucocytes per microlitre of CSF and the detection of leukemic 
blast cells, or by the presence of cranial nerve palsy. The presence of any 
leukemic cells in CSF (even from iatrogenic introduction due to a traumatic 
lumbar puncture) predicts an increased risk of ALL relapse. The following 
presenting features are associated with an increased risk of CNS relapse 
in pediatric patients- 1) T-cell immunophenotype, 2) hyperleukocytosis, 
3) high-risk genetic abnormalities such as the Philadelphia chromosome 
and t(4;11), and 4) the presence of leukemic cells in cerebrospinal fluid 
(even from iatrogenic introduction due to a traumatic lumbar puncture). 
Patients with T-cell ALL and a baseline leukocyte count of more than 100 
× 109/L have the highest risk of CNS relapse. Early intensive systemic and 
intrathecal chemotherapy could reduce the CNS relapse to a negligible 
level, permitting the omission of cranial irradiation in most of the patients."

"Bone marrow involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is:
a. Stage 0
b. Stage 1
c. Stage 3
d. Stage 4","Ans. a. Stage 0  
 
Ref. Rai et al, Clinical staging of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Blood, 1975
The Rai classification of CLL ies upon the fact that in CLL there is 
a gradual and progressive increase in the body burden of atypical 
lymphocytes, starting in the blood and bone marrow (lymphocytosis), 
progressively involving lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), spleen and 
liver (organomegaly), with eventual compromise of bone marrow function 
(anemia and thrombocytopenia). So, bone marrow involvement in CLL 
is an early manifestation.
Rai devised a method of clinical staging of chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) based on the concept that CLL is a disease of progressive 
accumulation of nonfunctioning lymphocytes: stage O, bone marrow 
and blood lymphocytosis only; stage 1, lymphocytosis with enlarged 
nodes; stage II, lymphocytosis with enlarged spleen or liver or both; 
stage III, lymphocytosis with anemia; and stage IV:lymphocytosis with 
thrombocytopenia. Analysis of 125 patients in the series reported by Rai 
et al showed the following median survival times from diagnosis: stage 
0, is greater than 150 months; stage I, 101 months; stage II, 71 months; 
stage III, 19 months; stage IV, 19 months.

"The diagnosis of CLL is confirmed by:
a. Peripheral smear
b. Bone marrow aspirate and smear
c. Immunophenotyping
d. Cytogenetics","Ans. c. Immunophenotyping  
 
Ref. Blood, 2010,  How I treat CLL upfront,  
 
Gribben JG,  Hoffbrand 6/e pp534
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are not required for the diagnosis of 
CLL, because the diagnosis can be made from the abnormal lymphocytes 
(monoclonal B-cells more than 5000/micl) present in the blood, by flow-
cytometric techniques. There can three types of infiltrative patterns of 
lymphocytes recognized in bone marrow biopsy: nodular, interstitial, 
and diffuse, these patterns have prognostic significance. Patients with 
diffuse infiltration of bone marrow tend to have advanced disease and 
a poorer prognosis. Flow cytometry is essential for diagnosis and shows 
CD5+ve, CD23+ve B monoclonal lymphocytes. Peripheral smear shows 
the leukemic cells that are typically small, mature appearing lymphocytes 
with a dense nucleus, partially aggregated chromatin, and without 
discernible nucleoli. Smudge cells maybe seen but are not diagnostic of 
CLL. Cytogenetics helps in risk stratification and prognosis.
BM biopsy should be done if patient is considered for treatment. It is also 
done in the newly diagnosed patients when they present with cytopenias, 
since this may be useful in evaluating whether cytopenias are immune 
mediated or caused by marrow replacement by CLL."

d. Short arm of chromosome 9 to long arm of chromosome 22","Ans. b. Long arm of chromosome 9 to long arm of chromosome 22 
 
Ref. Hoffbrands 6/e p486
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia 
chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11) resulting in a BCR-ABL fusion gene. This 
genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product 
(BCR-ABL), which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. CML is 
associated with the fusion of two genes: BCR (on long arm of chromosome 
22) and ABL1 (on long arm of chromosome 9) resulting in the BCR-ABL1 
fusion gene. This abnormal fusion typically results from a reciprocal 
translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), that 
gives rise to an abnormal chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) 
chromosome. The translocation involves long arm of chromosome 9 to

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) describes the clinical and laboratory sequelae 
that result from the rapid release of intracellular contents of dying cancer 
cells. Rapid turnover of tumor cells results in a massive release of various 
intracellular contents (potassium, phosphate, nucleic acids, lactate 
dehydrogenase etc.) into the systemic circulation. Metabolic abnormalities 
in TLS include hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia and/or 
hypocalcemia, and renal, cardiac and neurologic dysfunction. Cairo and 
Bishop devised a classiﬁcation system to help standardize the deﬁnition 
of TLS. Clinical TLS requires the presence of laboratory TLS in addition 
to evidence of renal, cardiac, or neurologic dysfunction."
"True regarding rasburicase is:

Ref. Wilson PF, Berns JS. Onco-Nephrology: 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 7: 1730–1739, 2012
Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme approved for use by 
the Food and Drug Administration in patients who are at risk of developing 
tumor lysis syndrome or for the management of elevated uric acid levels. 
Urate oxidase metabolizes uric acid to the much more soluble allantoin, 
carbon dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide. The former is readily excreted by 
the kidneys. Clinical trials have demonstrated rasburicase to be effective 
in both pediatric and adult population. Adverse effects associated with 
rasburicase can be significant, ranging from anaphylactic reactions to 
methemoglobinemia. Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients who are 
glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficient because these patients 
cannot break down hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of rasburicase, 
which can lead to hemolysis. To overcome the hypersensitivity related 
risk of rasburicase, puricase and uricase PEG 20 are being tested in 
trials. Rasburicase will continue to be active in blood samples ex vivo, 
and thus inappropriately handled laboratory specimens may manifest 
spuriously low uric acid levels. Samples for uric acid should be placed 
on ice immediately after phlebotomy and run as quickly as possible to 
maximize reliable approximation of in vivo uric acid concentration."

Rasburicase is derived by a recombinant DNA from a modified Aspergillus 
flavus strain and expresssed in a modified yeast strain of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. A recombinant urate oxidase enzyme, rasburicase converts 
existing uric acid to allantoin, which is 5 to 10 times more soluble in urine

existing plasma uric acid; allopurinol affects only the future production of 
uric acid by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Rasburicase is contraindicated in

marrow in the average human may be replaced by malignant cells. 
The rapid liberation of potassium into the extracellular ﬂuid will lead 
to severe hyperkalemia if it exceeds the normal homeostatic uptake of 
potassium into liver and muscle cells. Potassium is the main intracellular 
cation regulated through the Na-K ATPase system. Its normal regulation 
is critical in maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of 
various cells: skeletal muscle, neural and cardiac muscle. Hyperkalemia 
is deﬁned as serum potassium level > 6.0 mEq/L or 25% increase from 
baseline. Neuromuscular and cardiac tissues are most susceptible to 
changes in potassium level. Neuromuscular symptoms may include 
fatigue, muscle cramps, anorexia, paresthesias, and irritability. In the 
cardiac tissue, depending on the degree of hyperkalemia, a variety of 
electrocardiographic changes can occur, including peaked T wave (> 5 
mm) with serum potassium level of 6 to 7 mEq/L, QRS complex widening 
and smaller amplitude of P wave with serum potassium of 7 to 8 mEq/L, 
fusion of QRS complex with T wave forming sine waves with serum 
potassium of 8 to 9 mEq/L, and ultimately atrioventricular dissociation, 
ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular ﬁbrillation and death when 
the serum potassium level increases above 9 mEq/L. Most symptoms 
appear when serum potassium level are > 6.0 mEq/L. Coexisting renal 
failure, metabolic acidosis, and potassium sparing medications can 
worsen hyperkalemia and must be observed closely and corrected. 
Pseudohyperkalemia can also sometimes occur in patients with AML and 
ALL exhibiting hyperleukocytosis (>100,000/mL). The falsely elevated 
potassium level occurs as a result of mechanical lysis of white blood 
cells (WBCs) during phlebotomy or ionic shifts following coagulation of 
blood in the vial."

of tumor cells releases massive quantities of intracellular contents 
(potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids that can be metabolized to

"True regarding hyperphosphatemia in TLS is, except:
a. The phosphorus concentration in malig nant cells is up to four times 
higher than in normal cells
b. When the calcium concentration times phosphate concentration 
(the calcium phosphate product) exceeds 60 mg2/dL2, there is an 
increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation
c. Hyperphosphatemia is more common with chemotherapy associated 
TLS than with spontaneous TLS
d. Rasburicase decreases the risk of hyper phosphatemia
e. All of the above","Ans. d. Rasburicase decreases the risk of hyperphosphatemia
With the development of effective hypouricemic agents (rasburicase 
and allopurinol), hyperphosphatemia has become the major metabolic 
complication associated with TLS. The phosphorus concentration in 
malignant cells is up to four times higher than in normal cells. Thus, 
rapid tumor breakdown often leads to hyperphosphatemia which 
can cause secondary hypocalcemia. When the calcium concentration 
times phosphate concentration (the calcium phosphate product) 
exceeds 60 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk of calcium phosphate 
precipitation in the renal tubules, which can lead to renal failure. In 
addition, precipitation in the heart may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. 
Spontaneous TLS is associated with hyperuricemia but frequently not 
with hyperphosphatemia. It has been postulated that rapidly growing 
neoplasms with high cell turnover rates produce high serum uric acid 
levels through rapid nucleoprotein turnover but that the tumor is able 
to reutilize released phosphorus for resynthesis of new tumor cells. In 
contrast, TLS after chemotherapy is due to cell destruction in the absence 
of reuptake of phosphorus. The primary toxicity of hyperphosphatemia 
is the secondary hypocalcemia that results from chelation of calcium 
by phosphate anions. Hypocalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, 
seizures, tetany, and death."

"The most important step in the management of tumor lysis syndrome 
is:
a. Hydration
b. Alkalization of the urine
c. Use of diuretics
d. All of the above","Ans. a. Hydration 
 
Ref. Wilson PF, Berns JS. Onco-Nephrology: Tumor Lysis Syndrome.  
Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 7: 1730–1739, 2012
Fluid resuscitation is a mainstay of therapy in TLS and is recommended 
as prophylaxis in any patient at risk of developing TLS. Crystalloid 
volume expansion increases renal clearance of the electrolytes including 
potassium, phosphate, and uric acid. In addition, distal delivery of 
sodium and chloride augment potassium secretion. Increased urine 
ﬂow in the setting of volume expansion decreases both the calcium-
phosphate product in the urine as well as the urine concentration of 
uric acid, potentially reducing obstructive crystal formation. Diuretics 
250 Mcqs in Hematology
do not have a proven role in reducing the incidence or severity of TLS, 
their routine use is not recommended unless there are clinical signs 
or symptoms of volume overload, and their use can lead to excessive 
volume depletion. Alkalinisation of the urine favors conversion of uric 
acid to the more soluble urate salt, decreasing the potential for intra-
tubular crystal formation. However, administering exogenous alkali 
decreases the solubility of calcium-phosphate salts, leading to increased 
soft-tissue and renal tubular deposition of calcium-phosphate crystals. 
Further, alkalemia favors calcium binding to albumin, decreasing ionized 
calcium concentration, which may precipitate tetany or arrhythmia in 
these patients who are already prone to hypocalcemia. Therefore, urinary 
alkalinization for the prevention or treatment of TLS is not generally 
recommended and may be harmful."
"True about allopurinol is:
a. Is used for the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome
b. Safe in renal failure
c. Is a competitive xanthine oxidase inhibitor
d. Does not cause serious adverse effects
e. All of the above","Ans. c. Is a competitive xanthine oxidase inhibitor 
 
Ref. Wilson PF, Berns JS. Onco-Nephrology:  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 7: 1730–1739, 2012
Allopurinol is a competitive xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Oxypurinol, a 
metabolite of allopurinol is excreted by the kidneys with a long half-life of 
up to 24 hours in normal individuals, making dosing complex in patients 
with acute or chronic renal failure. Allopurinol decreases the generation of 
uric acid from xanthine but does not have a direct effect on uric acid levels. 
As such, initiation of allopurinol therapy after marked hyperuricemia 
has already occurred and TLS has progressed signiﬁcantly is unlikely to 
alter the clinical course of TLS. However, prophylactic use of allopurinol 
is generally recommended in patients with high- or intermediate-risk 
tumors. Allopurinol is associated with several potentially severe adverse 
effects, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, and the allopurinol hypersensitivity 
syndrome. Febuxostat, a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor that does not 
have the hypersensitivity proﬁle of allopurinol and does not require 
dosing adjustments for reduced GFR, is an attractive consideration for 
prophylaxis in patients at risk for TLS with impaired kidney function. So 
allopurinol is used as a prophylactic drug for TLS and not for the treatment 
of TLS for which rasburicase is used. Moreover, its dose modification is 
required in renal failure."

Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia demonstrates lymphoplasmacytic 
lymphoma (LPL) in the bone marrow with an IgM monoclonal gammo-
pathy in the blood. Patients may present with symptoms related to the 
infiltration of the hematopoietic tissues or the effects of monoclonal IgM 
in the blood. A diagnosis of IgM multiple myeloma is preferred over a 
diagnosis of WM if bone lesions are present. Symptoms of hyperviscosity 
and the presence of lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly favor a 
diagnosis of WM. Easy brusiability, cold agglutinin disease and peripheral 
neuropathy may also be present. Hypercalcemia is usually a feature 
of multiple myeloma where there is significant bone involvement.  To 
establish the diagnosis of WM, it is necessary to demonstrate an IgM 
monoclonal protein, along with histologic evidence of infiltration of the 
bone marrow by lymphoplasmacytic cells. Whereas IgM levels will be 
elevated in almost all WM patients, IgA and IgG levels are subnormal and 
may contribute to recurring sinus and bronchial infections."

Ref. M Seligmann, Alpha-chain disease, J Clin Pathol 1975
Alpha-heavy chain disease is a type of heavy chain disease (HCD) 
characterized by the production of incomplete monoclonal alpha-heavy 
chains without associated light chains. Alpha-HCD is considered to be a 
subtype of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID). Alpha 
heavy chain disease appears to be a condition affecting the secretory 
IgA system and mainly the digestive tract. Its age distribution is in sharp 
contrast to that of multiple myeloma since it occurs mainly in the second 
and third decades of life (20–30 years). Patients present with symptoms of 
malabsorption. Diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain are common. 
257
Multiple Myeloma
Infiltration of the jejunal mucosa with plasmacytoid cells is the most 
frequent pathologic feature. The diagnosis of alpha-HCD is based on 
identification of free alpha-heavy chains without associated light chains. 
Truncated alpha-heavy chains can be detected in biological fluids (serum, 
urine, jejunal secretions) by immunoelectrophoresis or immunofixation. 
Alpha-HCD disease must be differentiated from non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
and needs exclusion of celiac disease. For patients with symptomatic 
disease not responding adequately to antibiotics, chemotherapy similar 
to that used to treat NHL is recommended."
"Plasma cell leukemia should have:

b. 1000–2000/ul
c. > 2000/ul
d. None","Ans. c. > 2000/ul 
 
 
Ref. van de Donk, How I treat plasma cell leukemia, Blood. 2012 
Primary plasma cell leukemia is the most aggressive form of the plasma 
cell disorders. It is defined by the presence of > 2000/ul peripheral blood 
plasma cells or plasmacytosis accounting for 20% of the differential 
white cell count, and does not arise from preexisting multiple myeloma. 
Circulating monoclonal plasma cells can also be detected using a slide-
based immunofluorescence assay, a two-color immunoassay technique 
(ELISPOT), or flow cytometry by gating on CD38+/CD45- cells. When 
plasma cell leukemia develops from multiple myeloma then it is referred 
as secondary PCL. Compared with classic multiple myeloma, PCL has 
both a different biologic background as well as distinct clinical and 
laboratory features. The prognosis of PCL is very poor, with a median 
overall survival of only 7–8 months with standard chemotherapy. In 
contrast to multiple myeloma, the dissemination of tumor cells out of the 
BM in plasma cell leukemia is not only related to changes in expression 
of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors on plasma cell but also 
to the presence of several molecular aberrations, which contribute to BM 
microenvironment-independent tumor growth, inhibition of apoptosis, 
and escape from immune surveillance"

hyperviscosity syndrome. Blood 2012
IgM which is a giant molecule and 80% of it remains intravascular and 
is the commonest cause of hyperviscosity. The most common condition 
in which IgM is raised is Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. The serum 
viscosity is measured by the Ostwald viscometer (capillary tube method). 
It is a simple, cheap and reliable method for measuring relative serum 
viscosity in patients. The viscosity of water at 20 °C is 1.0 centipoise. 
Viscosity is measured by the time required for a serum or plasma 
sample to flow through a tube under the influence of gravity. Viscous 
samples flow more slowly and hence have high viscosity. The most 
common automated viscometers used is the cone/plate type. Normal

Hodgkin Lymphoma","Ans. d.   All of the above 
 
Ref. Lucia Nogová, Biology, Clinical Course and Management of 
Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma, ASH
NLPHL tends to present with chronic asymptomatic lymphadenopathy; 
70–80% of cases present with early-stage disease and, compared with 
CHL, mediastinal involvement and ‘B’ symptoms are less common. 
NLPHL tends to relapse as a large-cell lymphoma. NLPHL differs in 
histological and clinical presentation from classical Hodgkin lymphoma. 
The typical morphologic signs of NLPHL are atypical “lymphocytic and 
histiocytic” (L&H) cells, called popcorn cells, which are surrounded by 
a non-neoplastic nodular background of small lymphocytes of B-cell 
origin. The NLPHL cells are positive for CD45, CD19, CD20, CD22 and 
CD79a, but lack expression of CD15 and CD30, the typical markers for 
CHL. Treatment of NLPHL patients using standard Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HL) protocols leads to complete remission (CR) in more than 95% of 
patients. Survival and freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) are worse 
in advanced-stage patients than in early-stage patients. Thus, patients 
in advanced and in early stages with unfavorable risk factors are treated 
similarly to CHL patients. In contrast, patients with early-stage NLPHL 
without risk factors can be sufficiently treated with reduced intensity 
programs having less severe adverse effects. As a result, treatment of 
early NLPHL is less clearly defined, including radiotherapy in extended 
field (EF) or involved field (IF) technique, combined modality treatment, 
and, more recently, monoclonal antibody rituximab. ESMO guidelines 
recommend radiotherapy alone for stage 1A NLPHL and chemotherapy

"Most specific marker for the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia is:
a. TRAP
b. DBA 44
c. Annexin A1
d. CD11c","Ans. c. Annexin A1 
 
Ref. WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic

Annexin A1 is the most specific HCL marker since it is not expressed in 
any other small B-cell lymphoma other than HCL. Expression of annexin 
A1 can be used to distinguish HCL from SMZL and HCL variant as both 
are annexin 1 negative. Despite its specificity, annexin A1 is not useful 
for detecting minimal involvement at diagnosis or low levels of residual 
HCL after treatment as it also expressed by myeloid cells and some T-cells. 
Hairy cells are CD5 and CD23 negative, express surface membrane 
immunoglobulin (SmIg) strongly with either or chains and are FMC7 
positive. Expression of both TRAP and CD72 (the antigen reactive with 
DBA.44) has been shown to have high sensitivity for HCL and a high 
specificity for the disease; combined TRAP/DBA.44 positivity was found 
in only 3% of cases of non-HCL lymphoproliferative diseases. CD11c,

Immunohistochemistry on bone marrow trephine specimens should 
include CD20 and CD72 (DBA.44). Use of DBA.44 and other more HCL-
specific antibodies is not recommended unless as part of a wider panel 
including CD20 since their performance is inferior in MRD detection.

One of the major therapeutic goals of the Polycythemia Vera Study 
Group (PVSG) was the prevention of thrombosis by utilizing phlebotomy 
with or without concomitant myelosuppressive therapy. The results 
of PVSG trial were: 1) Phlebotomy treatment yielded the best overall 
survival, but at the cost of increased thrombotic events during the first 
three years. 2) Myelosuppressive therapy reduced the incidence of 
thrombosis, but increased the risk of AML, lymphoma, gastrointestinal, 
and skin malignancies. 3) Aspirin significantly lowered the combined 
risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal 
stroke, pulmonary embolism, or major venous thrombosis. Aspirin also 
significantly reduced the combined rate of major or minor thrombosis. 
Hydroxyurea (starting dose 15 to 20 mg/kg per day) should also be started 
in patients who are at high-risk for thrombosis (age > 60, prior thrombosis).

d. Venesection is helpful
e. All are true","Ans. d. Venesection is helpful
The term apparent erythrocytosis, also called pseudopolycythemia or 
relative polycythemia, is used for persons with a raised venous hematocrit 
due to a low plasma volume, but with a normal red cell mass. This is the 
commonest cause for a mildly elevated hematocrit. In cases where red 
cell mass is not measured, this term is more difficult to apply, but will 
require the demonstration of an elevated and stable hematocrit value 
by serial measurements. There is no evidence supporting therapy of 
pseudopolycythemia with venesection."

or hematocrit more than 52 in men and more than 48 in women, or 
other evidence of increased red cell volume. Almost all patients with PV 
harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2

Ref. Passamonti F, How I treat polycythemia vera, Blood 2012
A neutrophilia is present in approximately two-thirds and thrombocytosis 
in 50% of polycythemia vera cases and provides a useful minor criterion 
for the diagnosis of PV. Complete blood cell count (CBC) evaluation has 
a great importance in the evaluation of PV as a pan-myeloproliferative 
pattern (erythrocytosis with leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis) is 
more consistent with PV than isolated erythrocytosis. If a patient with PV 
has splenomegaly with isolated erythrocytosis only then asymptomatic 
splanchnic vein thrombosis should be ruled out by ultrasound or CT scan."
"True regarding polycythemia vera is:
a. Bone marrow biopsy is not required

Polycythemia vera commonly presents at a median age of 70 years. The 
incidence is similar in males and females. Patient should be checked 
for exon 12 mutations of JAK2 in case of V617F-negative erythrocytosis 
with low serum EPO levels or in case of pan-myeloproliferative V617F-
negative PV. Although a bone marrow biopsy is an important part of the 
diagnostic criteria, it may not always be necessary, because if diagnosis 
can be easily made by other requisite criteria (2 major and 1 minor 
criteria or 1 major and 2 minor) then bone marrow examination can be

deferred. In cases where the likelihood of PV is very high (e.g. in a patient 
with erythrocytosis, subnormal EPO and JAK2 mutation, or with the 
combination of eryhrocytosis, neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, subnormal 
EPO and palpable spleen), a bone marrow biopsy might be considered 
optional. In patients with JAK2-mutated erythrocytosis and low EPO, BM 
biopsy is not required, but in all other situations BM biopsy is mandatory. 
The hematocrit should be maintained at less than 0.45 by phlebotomy. 
There is currently no evidence to support a different level of hematocrit 
in males and females. Hemoglobin levels should not be used for decision 
making regarding phlebotomy. Aspirin should be given to all patients 
with PV."

than 1,800/μL, and a platelet count of less than 100,000/μL. A diagnosis 
of RCMD requires that dysplastic features be present in more than 10% of

MDS with 5q deletion occurs more usually in elderly women and is 
characterized by marked macrocytic anemia and thrombocytosis 
that is commonly referred to as 5q–syndrome. The bone marrow is 
typically hypercellular with prominent megakaryocytes that are slightly 
decreased in size with conspicuously non–lobated or hypolobated 
nuclei. Erythroid activity is often reduced but dysplasia is generally 
minimal and myeloblasts comprise less than 5% of cells. Thrombocytosis

"Pathophysiology of MDS involves:

Immunological abnormalities are commonly encountered in MDS, 
suggesting that they may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. This 
is particularly apparent in cases of hypoplastic MDS that share a number 
of features in common with aplastic anemia, notably clinical presentation 
with macrocytosis and varying levels of dyserythropoietic features of MDS 
347
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
is the presence of cytopenias. For those patients undergoing leukemic 
transformation, the cytopenias arise due to maturation block of the 
malignant cells. However, in cases of MDS that lack an excess of blasts, the 
cytopenias are a reﬂection of the ineffective hemopoiesis. The mechanism 
appears to be one of increased apoptosis of hemopoietic precursors in 
the marrow, as demonstrated using  in situ  end-labelling of fragmented 
DNA to reveal cells undergoing programmed cell death. Apoptosis is more 
prominent in early MDS, such as RA and RARS, than in advanced MDS 
with excess myeloblasts."

"Preferred treatment for elderly MDS patient with del 7q is:
a. Supportive care
b. Linalidomide
c. Azacitidine
d. 3+7 induction","Ans. c. Azacitidine
Treatment of MDS patients with intensive chemotherapy regimens 
generally yields low remission rates and high relapse rates. AML induction 
regimens (3+7) often result in prolonged chemotherapy related hypoplasia 
with remission rates that are considerably lower than for denovo AML. 
Studies with intensive chemotherapy have reported remission rates for 
high-risk MDS of 38–79% but these were generally short lived, lasting 5–15 
months. The karyotype appears to be the major determinant of response to 
intensive chemotherapy in MDS, with normal karyotype associated with 
high complete remission (CR) rate and longer remissions while complex 
349
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
karyotypes, particularly loss of chromosome 5 or 7, are associated with 
low CR rate and shorter remissions. 
Standard myeloablative allotransplant is reserved for younger patients 
with good performance status and  high-risk disease whose prognosis is 
otherwise very poor.  Compared with standard conditioning, RIC regimens 
are characterized by reduced myelosuppression aimed at decreasing 
toxicity and  related  mortality. A Phase III trial in MDS patients with 
intermediate - 2 or high-risk disease, the AZA - 001 study compared 
azacitidine with conventional care regimens (best supportive care, low 
- dose cytarabine or intensive chemotherapy) and demonstrated that 
azacitidine confers a median survival beneﬁt of over  9 months (24.5 
vs. 15 months), with almost doubling of the survival at 2 years (51% vs. 
26%). In addition, subgroup analysis demonstrated that azacitidine is 
associated with signiﬁcant beneﬁt in patients with adverse cytogenetics 
involving chromosome 7, with a 67% reduction in deaths and a survival 
advantage at 2 years of 33% compared with 8%. This latter ﬁnding has been 
conﬁrmed by another study that found a signiﬁcant survival advantage 
in high risk patients, with median survival of 24.8 months for patients 
with monosomy 7 or 7q – and 17.3 months for patients with complex 
cytogenetics. Lenalidomide is used mostly in lower-risk MDS; 63% of 
patients who were transfusion - dependent became independent of

with del(5q) compared  with normal karyotype or other cytogenetic 
abnormalities (83% vs. 57% vs. 12%, respectively)."

Patient should be brought into remission before transplants for better

partial remission following intensive chemotherapy, then the prospects 
of successful outcome from allogeneic transplantation are minimal 
and palliative treatment with supportive care maybe a preferable 
option. A FLAMSA-conditioned RIC transplant could be considered 
in these cases. It is a more intensive conditioning regimen comprising 
ﬂudarabine, cytarabine and amsacrine (FLAMSA) combined with ATG,

Differentiation syndrome is the main complication associated with 
therapy using agents that promote differentiation, such as ATRA and ATO, 
during induction therapy of APL. Because of the life-threatening nature 
of the full-blown syndrome, specific treatment with dexamethasone at 
a dose of 10 mg twice daily by intravenous injection should be started 
promptly at the very earliest symptom or sign. ATRA is well tolerated, 
however the incidence of differentiation syndrome has been described 
in up to 25–30% APL patients.  In most reported cases, symptoms relating 
to Differentiation syndrome began in a median of nine days (range: 0-23 
days) from the start of treatment.  Differentiation syndrome includes the 
following according to the criteria of Frankel - three of the following signs 
in the absence of other causes: fever, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrate, 
pericardial or pleural effusion, hypotension, liver failure and/or acute 
renal failure, with 37.9% of early deaths. On suspicion of symptoms 
related to Differentiation syndrome, the early addition of high doses of 
dexamethasone reduces associated mortality from 30 to 5% or less. It is 
recommended to start dexamethasone using an intravenous dose of 10 mg 
twice daily until total regression of the symptoms. Most patients present 
a rapid improvement with the administration of the corticosteroid. But, 
there is no evidence supporting the prophylactic use of corticosteroids 
in patients with APL to prevent Differentiation syndrome. ATRA should 
be stopped for 48–72 hours and reintroduced at a 50% dose with stepped 
increases until the full dose."

is controversial. The association of cytarabine to an anthracycline and 
ATRA in the consolidation therapy of patients diagnosed with APL is 
recommended for under 65-year-old high-risk patients based on the 
significant reduction in the relapse rate and the significant increases in 
EFS. There is no evidence to support this association for intermediate- or 
low-risk patients."
"Treatment for a relapsed APL patient in second molecular remission 
is:
a. ATRA maintenance
b. Arsenic trioxide and ATRA maintenance
c. Autologous transplant
d. Allogeneic transplant","Ans. c. Autologous transplant 
 
Ref. Sanz MA, Management of acute promyelocytic leukemia:  
recommendations from an expert panel on behalf of the European 
LeukemiaNet, Blood 2009 
The European Group of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
recommends autologous BMT or a transplant with a HLA-identical related 
donor for cases of APL in second CR and BMT with a HLA-identical related 
donor in the case of molecular persistent APL. The OS was significantly 
higher for patients who underwent autologous BMT compared to 
allogenic BMT in molecular CR2 while there was no significant difference 
for DFS and EFS between autologous or allogeneic BMT. Data suggests 
that autologous BMT is very effective in the treatment of APL for patients 
in second complete molecular remission. Allogeneic BMT, though with 
a lower relapse rate, is associated with high transplant-related mortality 
and is preferred for those who do not achieve second remission or relapse 
after autologous transplant or had high-risk disease.

"The method most effective in predicting APL relapse is:
a. Flow cytometry
b. FISH
c. RT-PCR
d. RQ-PCR","Ans. d. RQ-PCR
Molecular diagnosis of relapse in APL can be performed by FISH, RT-PCR 
and RQ-PCR; RQ-PCR (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction) 
is the most important to predict hematologic relapse and DFS. In assessing 
the MRD in APL with RQ-PCR, values less than 3 log after the end of 
consolidation treatment compared with values more than 3 log  proved 
to be the most important predictor of relapse. PCR analysis of PML-RARA 
is preferably carried out on RNA extracted from BM samples. Recurrence 
of PCR positivity typically occurs first in the marrow, and occasionally 
PML-RARA transcripts do not become detectable in peripheral blood until 
time of hematologic relapse. Therefore, in some patients the monitoring 
of peripheral blood alone (even if performed monthly) could reduce the 
opportunity for successful delivery of preemptive therapy to prevent 
disease progression."
"Side effects of arsenic trioxide include:
a. QT prolongation
b. Hypokalemia
c. Hypomagnesiumeia
d. All of the above","Ans. d. All of the above 
Ref. Williams 8e, Hoffbrand 6e
Treatment with ATO is associated with several electrolyte abnormalities 
and QT prolongation that can lead to a torsade de pointes-type ventricular 
arrhythmia, which can be fatal. This requires careful monitoring to 
maintain the serum potassium above 4.0 mEq/L and serum magnesium 
above 1.8 mg/dL. In patients who reach an absolute QT interval value 
longer than 500 msec, ATO should be withheld, the electrolytes (potassium 
and magnesium) repleted, and other medications that may cause 
prolonged QT interval should be discontinued."
"Response to induction therapy in APL should be assessed at:
a. 7 days
b. 14 days
c. 28–30 days
d. After 45 days","Ans. d. After 45 days 
 
Ref. Sanz MA, Management 
of acute promyelocytic leukemia: recommendations from an expert panel 
on behalf of the European LeukemiaNet, Blood 2009    
Treatment with ATRA should be continued allowing sufﬁcient time for 
terminal differentiation of blasts to occur. Molecular assessment by RT-
PCR after induction has no clinical relevance, because PCR positivity 
at this early time point may simply reﬂect delayed maturation instead 
of resistance. Potentially misleading cytomorphologic features due to 
incomplete blast maturation are occasionally seen even after several 
weeks from treatment initiation (up to 40–50 days). CR is attained in 
virtually all patients with genetically proven PML-RARA APL. In contrast 
to the lack of clinical value of molecular assessment performed at the end 
of induction, RT-PCR of PML-RARA in BM carried out on regeneration 
after the ﬁnal course of chemotherapy is extremely relevant to determine 
the relapse risk in the individual patient.

"Treatment of  a pregnant female with APL in first trimester is:
a. ATRA
b. Arsenic trioxide
c. Daunorubicin
354 Mcqs in Hematology
d. Supportive care with platelets and FFP transfusion
e. None of the above","Ans. c. Daunorubicin 
 
Ref. Sanz MA, Management of acute promyelocytic leukemia:  
recommendations from an expert panel on behalf of the European 
LeukemiaNet, Blood 2009 
Both ATRA and arsenic trioxide have teratogenic potential therefore 
therapeutic options for patients diagnosed during the ﬁrst trimester are 
limited. ATRA (like retinoids) is considered highly teratogenic in first 
trimester. ATRA should be avoided during the ﬁrst trimester. If elective 
abortion is unacceptable, administration of daunorubicin chemotherapy 
alone, without ATRA, is the only option during the ﬁrst trimester.  Among 
anthracyclines, it has been suggested that daunorubicin might be 
preferred because this agent is known to be effective in APL and there 
is more published experience of its use in pregnancy. If remission is 
achieved with chemotherapy and the pregnancy is progressing normally, 
treatment with ATRA could be administered during the second and third 
trimesters. ATO also has high potential for embryotoxicity and it cannot 
be recommended for use at any stage of pregnancy. Treatment with 
ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy seem reasonably safe 
when applied to patients with APL presenting during the second or third 
trimester of pregnancy."
"True regarding therapy related APL are, all except:
a. Breast carcinoma is the most frequent previous cancer
b. Drugs most commonly implicated in therapy related APL are 
epirubicin and mitoxantrone
c. Latency period is less than 3 years
d. Occurs without a preceding myelodysplastic phase
e. Therapy related APL have a very poor prognosis and requires 
aggressive chemotherapy","Ans. e.  Therapy related APL have a very poor prognosis and requires 
aggressive chemotherapy 
Ref. Sanz MA, Management of acute promyelocytic leukemia: 
recommendations from an expert panel on behalf of the European 
LeukemiaNet, Blood 2009 
Breast carcinoma is the most common previous cancer, followed by 
lymphoma, with a large predominance of non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
compared with Hodgkin disease. The drugs most commonly implicated 
in therapy related APL are epirubicin and mitoxantrone, but several cases 
have been reported to follow exposure to radiotherapy alone.  The latency 
period between chemotherapy for previous cancer and development of 
therapy related APL is less than 3 years and typically occurs without a 
preceding myelodysplastic syndrome. Hematologic and clinical findings 
do not differ from those observed in de novo APL. Patients with therapy 
related APL have a relatively favorable prognosis. The treatment of therapy 
related APL is same as that of denovo APL."
"The risk of GVHD in 10/10 matched un related donor compared to 
6/6 sibling matched donor will be:
a. More
b. Less 
c. Same
d. Varies","Ans. a. More
Even with a complete 10/10 matched unrelated donor, the risk of GVHD is 
higher than for an HLA-identical sibling, presumably because the number 
of polymorphic minor H antigen differences is likely to be greater."
"Acute GVHD is mediated by:
a. Host T-cells
b. Donor T-cells
c. Host B-cells
d. Donor B-cells","Ans. b. Donor T-cells 
 
Ref: Thomas’ Hematopoietic Cell 
Transplantation 4th ed
GVHD is a complex immunological disorder in which donor T-cells 
with specificity for recipient antigens not expressed in the donor initiate 
tissue damage in the host. Induction of  GVHD requires the interaction 
of donor T-cells with host antigen-presenting cells (APCs), most probably 
dendritic cells within secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes 
and gut - associated lymphoid tissue. Donor CD4 and CD8 T-cells with 
anti - host specifi city, activated on interaction with host APCs, proliferate 
and develop effector functions that , IL-2, lead to the secretion of effector 
cytokines (e.g. TNF, interferons IL-17) or the induction of perforin/
granzyme B pathways required for cellular cytotoxicity. In acute GVHD, 
CD8 cells are regarded as the most relevant effectors, whereas CD4 cells 
are thought to be more important for the development of chronic GVHD."
"True regarding immune reconstitution posttransplant are, all except:
a. Can be evaluated in the clinic by monitoring the absolute numbers 
of T-cells
b. Thymus plays an important role 
c. GVHD delays immune reconstitution
d. B-cell recovery is the first to occur
e. All of the above are true","Ans. d. B-cell recovery is the first to occur
Allogeneic SCT is followed by a prolonged period of cellular and 
humoral immunodeficiency. Reconstitution of an immune response 
after transplantation can be evaluated in the clinic by monitoring the 
absolute numbers of  T (CD4, CD8), B and NK-cell numbers. NK-cell 
numbers recover most rapidly while other subsets (especially CD4 
cells and B cells) recover more slowly. Thymus plays an important 
role in immune reconstitution. Thymic function is reduced in adults 
and may be further compromised by the effects of chemoradiotherapy 
and GVHD. Quantitative B-cell deficiency is present in virtually all 
patients in the first months after transplantation and may persist for a 
number of years post transplantation as a consequence of reductions 
in the number of marrow B-cell precursors, particularly in patients with 
chronic GVHD. Reconstitution of bone marrow can be divided into two 
distinct phenomena-1) numerical recovery of BM cellular elements and 
2) functional recovery of cellular interactions. Immune reconstitution 
involves several components including (1) thymic and extra-thymic T-cell 
368 MCqs in Hematology
development, (2) reconstitution of effector cells including cytotoxic T-cells 
and natural killer (NK) cells, and (3) efficient antigen presentation (4) 
reappearance of functional B-cells."
"The number of CD34 required for successful engraftment in

Ref: Thomas’ Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 4th ed, pg 1210
The major determinant of engraftment after an autologous transplant is 
stem cell number, and graft failure is exceedingly rare if at least 2 × 106 
CD34+cells/kg are transplanted. The lowest/kg CD34  acceptable stem cell 
dose to secure engraftment in an allogeneic setting is considered to be

Stem Cell Transplantations","Ans. e. All of the above      
 
Ref: Thomas’ Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 4th ed, pg 299
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that, when administered in the 
doses routinely used in myeloablative conditioning regimens (120–200 
mg/kg), has both immunosuppressive and antileukemic properties. It 
is a prodrug that must be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system 
in the liver to produce metabolically active derivatives, principally 
phosphoramide mustard, which exert their cytotoxic activity through 
the production of interstrand DNA links. The two major complications of 
cyclophosphamide at the doses employed in allogeneic transplantation 
are hemorrhagic cystitis and cardiac toxicity. Hemorrhagic cystitis 
results from the toxic effects of a cyclophosphamide metabolite, 
acrolein, on the uroepithelium and can be reduced by use of sodium 2 – 
mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), while cardiac toxicity is very rare at 
doses of cyclophosphamide below 150 mg/kg."
"True regarding CMV reactivation following allogeneic stem cell 
transplant are:
a. Highest risk of CMV reactivation is in seropositive recipients
b. Increased risk in those who receive T-cell depleted graft

b. Can be reduced by transfusing  irradiated blood products","Ans. b. Increased risk in those who receive T-cell depleted graft                 
Ref: Boeckh M, Ljungman P. How I treat cytomegalovirus in 
hematopoietic cell transplant recipients Blood. 2009, Thomas’ 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 4th ed
Patients at the highest risk of CMV reactivation are seropositive recipients, 
especially those who receive TCD or unrelated donor grafts, and patients 
who develop GVHD requiring steroid therapy. CMV reactivation occurs 
in 40–80% of at-risk patients and until recently a substantial number of 
such patients developed  CMV disease. Low levels of CMV infection can 
be detected after transplantation, using either polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) – based detection of CMV or detection of pp65 antigen in peripheral 
blood leucocytes (CMV antigenemia). Primary infection of seronegative 
patients may occur as a result of the infusion of stem cell or blood products 
369

from a CMV-positive donor but is rare. For this reason seronegative 
transplant recipients should receive CMV-negative or leucodepleted blood 
products to limit the possibility of primary infection. Irradiation prevents 
transfusion associated GVHD not CMV infection. So post transplant, 
patient should receive both irradiated and leukodepleted blood products. 
If only a CMV-seropositive donor is available for a CMVseronegative 
patient, the risk of transmission of CMV by the stem cell product to the 
recipient is approximately 20% to 30%."

b. Ganciclovir
c. Valganciclovir
d. Foscarnet","Ans. b. Ganciclovir 
Ref: Thomas’ Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 4th ed
CMV pneumonia remains the most feared complication of CMV in 
HCT recipients because its attributable mortality continues to be

Engraftment is defined as an absolute  neutrophil count that is greater than 
500/micl and a sustained platelet count that is greater than 20,000/micl that 
lasts for three consecutive days without transfusions. Myeloid engraftment 
typically occurs within 28 days of the graft infusion, irrespective of whether 
an autologous, allogeneic matched related or unrelated product of 
marrow or blood progenitor cells is used. A hemoglobin level of at least 
8 g/dL without transfusion support is an accepted threshold for red cell 
engraftment. Primary graft failure is defined as a failure to achieve these 
threshold counts beyond day 28 post transplantation."
"The following are more common during the first month of transplant, 
except:
a. Pulmonary edema
b. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
c. Aspergillosis
d. CMV pneumonia","Ans. d. CMV pneumonia             
Ref: Sharma SK, Kumar S, et al. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage Following 
Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation: A Case Report 
and A Short Review. Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus, 2014
There are mainly six main differentials of early pulmonary involvement post 
transplant (Table 1). These are 1) pulmonary edema (PE), 2) transfusion 
associated acute lung injury (TRALI), 3) engraftment syndrome (ES), 
4) idiopathic pulmonary syndromes (IPS) including diffuse alveolar 
hemorrhage (DAH), 5) infections notably pulmonary aspergillosis, CMV 
and PCP and 6) drug toxicity. Pulmonary edema typically occurs in the 
second or third week after the transplant. Pulmonary edema may be 
due to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure or increased pulmonary 
370 MCqs in Hematology
capillary permeability. DAH is a form of noninfectious pneumonitis that 
is characterized by the sudden onset of dyspnea, nonproductive cough, 
fever, and hypoxemia; hemoptysis is rare. DAH is typically diagnosed 
with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The diagnosis of DAH is considered 
when successive aliquots of BAL fluid become increasingly hemorrhagic; 
the diagnosis is established if all cytologic, pathologic, and microbiologic 
studies exclude the presence of pulmonary infection. The onset of 
Aspergillus infection occurs in a bimodal distribution, with the first peak 
at a median of 16 days and the second peak at a median of 96 days after 
BMT. The clinical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis include 
fever, dyspnea, dry cough, wheezing, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis. 
Localized infiltrates that are nodular or cavitary on CT of the chest are 
likely to be Aspergillus infection. CMV pneumonitis usually occurs 6 to 12 
weeks after BMT and affects 10% to 40% of patients. Ninety percent of CMV 
pneumonitis cases occur within the first 100 days after BMT (Table 38.1)."
"True regarding second malignancy follow ing stem cell transplanta-

common
c. Have aggressive behavior and poor prognosis
365
Stem Cell Transplantations
d. Azathioprine use for GVHD increases the risk
e. All of the above","Ans. e. All of the above
The primary role of T-cells in the pathogenesis of GVHD provides the 
rationale for the use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and other anti-T cell 
antibodies. Another approach to the treatment of steroid-resistant grade 
II-IV acute GVHD is the administration of monoclonal antibodies directed 
against the IL-2 receptor (anti-CD25, Daclizumab). Daclizumab has been 
utilized in steroid refractory GvHD. The presumed contribution of tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) to acute GvHD  and the association 
of higher serum levels with worse outcome provide the rationale for 
the use of anti-TNF alpha antibodies in this disorder. Etanercept, a 
recombinant human TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein, has been used 
alone or in combination with steroids  to treat chronic and acute GvHD. 
Extracorporeal phototherapy (ECP) consists of infusion of ultraviolet-A 
irradiated autologous peripheral lymphocytes which have been collected 
by apheresis and incubated with 8-methoxypsoralen. This approach 
appears to be effective in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
and several autoimmune diseases and has been used to treat rejection 
after organ transplantation and bone marrow transplant. ECP appears 
to downregulate activated T-cell clones. It has a role in the treatment of 
both acute and chronic GVHD."
"The treatment of choice for grade III acute GvHD is:

Ref. Dignan FL, Diagnosis and management of acute  
graft-versus-host disease, BJH, 2012
Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs after allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant and is a reaction of donor immune cells 
against host tissues. Activated donor T-cells damage host epithelial cells 
after an inflammatory cascade that begins with the preparative regimen. 
Corticosteroids are the standard first line treatment for acute GvHD. Their 
effect is likely to be due to lympholytic effects and anti-inflammatory 
properties. Two milligram/kg per day of methylprednisolone is 
recommended as the starting dose for patients with grades III–IV acute 
GvHD. There is no consensus on the optimal dose and duration of steroid 
therapy due to the lack of data. A prospective,study comparing 2 mg/kg/
day of methyl-prednisolone with 10 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone 
showed no advantage of high-dose steroids over low dose steroids. The use 
of methylprednisolone at doses higher than 2 mg/kg/day is not routinely 
recommended."

Ref. Dignan  FL, BCSH/BSBMT Guideline: Diagnosis and  
Management of Chronic Graft- versus-Host Disease, BJH 2012
Alloreactivity forms the basis of the pathogenesis of CGVHD, but 
the phenotypes and origins of the alloreactive cells involved remain 
somewhat ambiguous. Attempts to study CGVHD experimentally have 
been somewhat hampered by the absence of a reliable animal model 
that exactly represents variable manifestations in humans. Chronic graft-
versus-host disease  remains a major complication of allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation and is the leading cause of late non-relapse death. 
The prevalence varies from 25–80% in long-term survivors. Chronic 
GvHD should be graded as mild, moderate or severe according to NIH 
consensus criteria. 
Corticosteroids are recommended in the first line treatment of chronic 
GvHD. An initial starting dose of 1 mg/kg prednisolone is recommended 
by BCSH. Calcineurin inhibitors may be helpful in the initial treatment 
of GvHD as a steroid sparing agent. Extra-corporeal photopheresis (ECP) 
has been considered as a second line treatment in skin, oral or liver 
chronic GvHD. The regimen involves using a daily dose of 1 mg/kg for 
two weeks and subsequently tapering to 1 mg/kg on alternate days over 
4 weeks if chronic GvHD is stable or improving. In severe GvHD, this 
387
Graft Versus Host Disease
dose may be maintained for 2–3 months and then tapered by 10–20% 
per month for a total duration of 9 months. In patients who are receiving 
other immunosuppressive agents it is recommended that steroids are 
tapered first."
"Severity of acute skin GvHD is assessed by, all except:

Chronic GvHD should be graded as mild, moderate or severe according 
to NIH consensus criteria.  The consensus conference also identified 
“diagnostic” and “distinctive” features of chronic GvHD. Diagnostic signs 
are clinical features that establish the diagnosis of chronic GvHD without 
the need for further investigations. Diagnostic manifestations include

the mouth or genitals, fasciitis and joint contractures. Distinctive findings 
include skin depigmentation, nail dystrophy, alopecia, xerostomia, 
mucoceles, ulceration of the mouth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and 
myositis. Cutaneous biopsy has not been found  to be useful in predicting 
severity of disease, though it may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Elafin 
is overexpressed in GvHD skin biopsies. Plasma levels of elafin have been 
found to be significantly higher in skin GvHD and correlate with severity 
of  GvHD, with a greater risk of death relative to other known risk factors 
and may have prognostic value as a biomarker of skin GvHD. Histological 
features on skin biopsy include apoptosis at base of epidermal rete pegs, 
dyskeratosis, exocytosis of lymphocytes, satellite lymphocytes adjacent 
to dyskeratotic epidermal keratinocytes and  perivascular lymphocytic

Gastrointestinal acute GvHD typically causes secretory diarrhoea. Patients 
can also have nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss and abdominal pain. 
Diarrhoea can be copious and, in severe acute GvHD, patient may have

Cyclosporin is used in the prophylaxis of GvHD. Cyclosporin binds to 
cyclophilin and prevents generation of  NF-AT which is a nuclear factor 
for initiating gene transcription for lymphokines including interleukin-2 
and interferon gamma. This action leads to suppression of cytokine 
production and subsequent inhibition of T-cell activation. A combination

 Ref. Tibblin AO, To continue or discontinue aspirin in the perioperative 
period: a randomized, controlled clinical trial, Br. J. Anaesth. (2010),  Veitch 
AM, Guidelines for the management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet 
therapy in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures, Gut 2008,  Assia 
El, Effect of aspirin intake on bleeding during cataract surgery, J Cataract 
Refract Surg, 1998
Thrombosis of a drug-eluting stent is a catastrophic complication. The 
risk of stent thrombosis is increased in the perioperative setting and 
is strongly associated with the cessation of antiplatelet therapy. In a 
patient with drug-eluting stent on asprin, the patient’s inherent risk for 
bleeding, concomitant treatments that may increase this risk of bleeding, 
the type of surgery to cause bleeding, and the patient’s risk for ischaemic 
cardiac events if antiplatelet therapy is stopped, all must be taken into 
consideration before stopping antiplatelet drugs. 
Studies have shown that discontinuation of aspirin therapy increases 
the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Patients at particularly high 
risk are those with recent or recurrent ACS with dual oral antiplatelet 
therapy, recent PCI (less than 4 weeks), left ventricular ejection fraction  
≤ 30%, triple-vessel disease, stent of length > 25 mm or, a drug-eluting stent 
(DES), history of thrombosis in a vessel of diameter ≤ 2.5 mm, incomplete 
revascularization, and ≥ 2 locations of symptomatic atherothrombosis. 
Guidelines developed by the Oral Medicine and Oral Surgery Francophone 
Society found that interruption of aspirin or thienopyridine (clopidogrel) 
therapy before most of the dental procedures is unnecessary. Most such 
procedures carry a low-risk of bleeding, and any bleeding that occurs can 
usually be controlled by local hemostasis. In general, discontinuation of 
antiplatelet therapy is considered unnecessary in procedures that are not 
highly invasive and therefore have a low bleeding risk. Oral, periodontal, 
and implant dental surgery are not associated with high rates of bleeding.
The French Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (SFAR) 
considers discontinuation of aspirin unnecessary before eye surgery. 
Because aspirin and clopidogrel have additive effects on bleeding time, a 
suggestion has been made to continue aspirin but discontinue clopidogrel 
399
consultative Hematology
before eye surgery in patients on combination therapy. Similarly, cataract 
surgery can be done without the increased risk of bleeding in a patient on 
aspirin, so discontinuation of aspirin before cataract surgery is usually not 
indicated. In tonsillectomy, pre- or post-operative aspirin may contribute 
to perioperative bleeding and increase the number of revision procedures 
for hemostasis. 
The Task Force on the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes of the 
European Society of Cardiology Force recommended that in patients with 
a low-risk of progressing to MI or death, oral antiplatelet agents should 
be discontinued 5 days before the procedure and reinstituted as soon as 
possible thereafter. Discontinuation of  antiplatelet therapy is associated 
with increased rates of stent thrombosis. If possible, at least 2–4 weeks 
should elapse between placement of a stent and major non-cardiac 
surgery. If the patient is not at high-risk of bleeding and if the surgery 
is not associated with significant blood loss, aspirin therapy should be 
continued. Thienopyridine discontinuation 5 days before the procedure 
should be considered on a case-by-case basis. If there is a high-risk of 
bleeding, withdrawal of both agents should be considered. If surgery 
is urgent or cannot be postponed for 5 days, discontinuation will not 
be possible or effective at the time of surgery and optimal surgical and 
pharmacological hemostasis must be employed. If bleeding occurs in a 
surgical patient whose antiplatelet therapy has not been discontinued, 
all antiplatelet drugs should be stopped immediately. 
Because of the hypercoagulable state induced by surgery, early withdrawal 
of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
increases the risk of postoperative myocardial infarction and death five- 
to 10-fold in stented patients who are on continuous dual antiplatelet 
therapy. The shorter the time between revascularization and surgery, 
the higher the risk of adverse cardiac events. Elective surgery should be 
postponed beyond these periods, whereas vital, semiurgent, or urgent 
operations should be performed under continued dual antiplatelet 
therapy. 
The risk of surgical hemorrhage is increased approximately 20 % by aspirin 
or clopidogrel alone, and 50% by dual antiplatelet therapy. The risk of a 
cardiovascular event when stopping antiplatelet agents preoperatively 
is higher than the risk of surgical bleeding when continuing these drugs, 
except during surgery in a closed space (e.g., intracranial, posterior eye 
chamber) or surgeries associated with massive bleeding and difficult 
hemostasis. The mean delay between aspirin withdrawal and late 
thrombosis from drug-eluting stents is seven days. Therefore, aspirin 
is a lifelong therapy that should not be interrupted. So, minor surgical 
400 Mcqs in Hematology
procedures without significant bleeding and bone marrow aspiration 
and biopsy can be performed in patients taking aspirin, without with-
holding it."

Ref. Metjian A, ASH evidence-based guidelines:  
should asymptomatic patients with antiphospholipid antibodies  
receive primary prophylaxis to prevent thrombosis? ASH 2009
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the normal healthy 
population has been estimated to range from 1.0% to 5.6%.  in patients 
with systemic lupus erythematosus the prevalence ranges from 11% 
to 86%. In asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibody positive patients, 
thromboprophylaxis with aspirin or low molecular weight heparin during

be effective in reducing thrombotic complications.

To summarize, this pt has anemia, renal failure, A/G reversal, lytic lesion 
in bone with bone pain and active infection (pneumonia). So the likely 
diagnosis is multiple myeloma. Acute leukemia will not have AG reversal 
and lytic bone lesion, so option e is incorrect. Nodular aggregates of small 
lymphocytes and Reed-Sternberg cells are characteristically seen in CLL 
and Hodgkin lymphoma, which are also unlikely diagnoses because of 
absence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly and moreover presence of 
lytic bone lesions. Scattered granulomas in bone marrow can be seen 
in many diseases but they are never associated with lytic bone lesions.
Causes of bone marrow granuloma:
• Malignant

Cat scratch disease is caused by Bortenella henselae and occurs after cat 
scratch. Commonly presents as tender, swollen lymph nodes near the 
site of the inoculating bite or scratch or on the neck and is usually limited 
to one side. This condition is referred to as regional lymphadenopathy 
and occurs 1-3 weeks after inoculation. Lymphadenopathy in CSD most 
commonly occurs in the arms, neck, or jaw, but may also occur near the 
groin or around the ear. Most patients also develop systemic symptoms 
such as malaise, decreased appetite, and aches. Other associated 
complaints include headache, chills, muscular pains, joint pains, arthritis, 
backache and abdominal pain. It may take 7 to 14 days, or as long as 
two months, before symptoms appear. Most cases are benign and self-
limiting, but lymphadenopathy may persist for several months after other 
symptoms disappear. The disease usually resolves spontaneously, with

Ref: Harrison’s 17/e p471
Clinically this pt is having massive splenomegaly without ascitis (absent

428 Mcqs in Hematology
Splenomegaly is absolutely not seen in sickle cell disease and hemo-
chromatosis. In infectious mononucleosis the splenomegaly is not 
massive. As he is not having ascites so portal hypertension is also unlikely. 
The causes of massive splenomegaly are:
• CML
• HCL
• Myelofibrosis
• Portal hypertension
• Chronic malaria
• Storage disorders
Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) is a bone marrow disease characterized 
by excessive production  of reticulin and collagen fibers. Although 
fibrosis of bone marrow can be the outcome of numerous hematologic 
and nonhematologic conditions, the term IMF is commonly used in 
primary MF without secondary cause.  The clinical signs of IMF include 
splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis; leukocytosis and 
thrombocytosis, with predisposition to thrombotic events, due to clonal 
cellular proliferation affecting mainly megakaryocytes and granulocytes; 
cytopenias, a later finding that worsens with the progression of fibrosis; 
and constitutional symptoms (e.g. fatigue, weight loss, low-grade fever, 
night sweats), most likely induced by abnormal levels of circulating 
cytokines"

Ref: William’s 8/e p2166, 2107
Presence of fever, renal failure, schistocytes in peripheral blood and 
normal coagulation profile with low platelet count goes in favor of TTP. 
Schistocytes can also be seen in DIC but the coagulation profile will 
be abnormal in DIC. In ITP and AIHA, schistocytes will not be seen. 
Trousseau syndrome is also known as migratory thrombophlebits seen in 
case of mostly GI malignancy. This case does not seems to be Trousseau 
syndrome because of the presence of low platelet count and schistocytes.
TTP is characterized by a pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic 
hemolytic anemia, fluctuating neurological signs, renal impairment and 
fever, and has insidious onset. The revised diagnostic criteria for TTP states 
that TTP must be considered even in the presence of thrombocytopenia 
and MAHA alone, without the pentad being present. Consumption of 
platelets in platelet-rich thrombi results in thrombocytopenia. Mechanical 
fragmentation of erythrocytes during flow through partially occluded, 
high shear small vessels causes a MAHA. The combination of hemolysis 
and tissue ischemia produces elevated lactate dehydrogenase values, 
and this has diagnostic and therapeutic implications. In view of the high 
risk of preventable, early deaths in TTP, treatment with plasma exchange

Ref: William’s 8/e p1437-38
This patient has presented with 4 months history of mild anemia, 
lymphocytic leukocytosis, generalized lymphadenopathy and 
hepatosplenomegaly which suggests the possibility of CLL. He is also 
having DCT positivity which is seen in CLL.
Patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (CLL) have a 5–10% risk of developing autoimmune 
complications which primarily cause cytopenia.  These autoimmune 
cytopenias can occur at any stage of CLL and do not have independent 
prognostic significance. The most common autoimmune complication 
is autoimmune hemolytic anemia with a lower frequency of immune 
thrombocytopenia and pure red blood cell aplasia and only rare 
patients with autoimmune granulocytopenia. The effect of autoimmune 
cytopenia on prognosis of patients with CLL remains uncertain. There 
could be multiple possible causes of cytopenia in CLL including bone 
marrow failure, hypersplenism, chemotherapy, sepsis, autoimmunity, 
and the possibility of two or more causes occurring simultaneously 
require careful clinical and laboratory assessment. ITP causes particular 
diagnostic difficulties. There is no sensitive and specific test for ITP 
to parallel the DAT in AIHA, and thrombocytopenia in CLL is more 
commonly due to splenomegaly and bone marrow failure secondary 
to infiltration by disease. In advanced disease, anemia usually occurs 
before thrombocytopenia, so isolated thrombocytopenia is more likely 
to be immune in origin."

a. G6PD deficiency
b. Beta-thalassemia
c. Sickle cell anemia
d. Hereditary spherocytosis
e. Malaria","Ans. b. Beta thalassemia 
Ref: William’s 8/e p691
This patient is having microcytic hypochromic anemia (low MCV) though 
the blood picture is not mentioned. His marrow is showing ME ratio of 1:4 
which means there is erythroid hyperplasia which is seen in hemolytic 
anemia. All the options mentioned are causes of hemolytic anemia, 
but the associated iron overload is seen only in cases of thalassemia. 
Infact, iron overload without blood transfusion is seen in thalassemia 
intermedia syndromes because of increased GI absorption. Disordered 
iron metabolism is less common in adult forms of alpha thalassemia.  
Symptomatic G6PD deficient patients are almost exclusively male, due to 
the X-linked pattern of inheritance, but female carriers can be clinically 
affected due to unfavorable lyonization, where random inactivation of an 
X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD-deficient red 
430 Mcqs in Hematology
blood cells coexisting with normal red cells. The G6PD / NADPH pathway 
is the only source of reduced glutathione in red blood cells. Individuals 
with G6PD deficiency incur a higher risk of acute hemolysis when exposed 
to certain medications. 
Most children and adults with hereditary spherocytosis have mild to 
moderate enlargement of the spleen, but other than assisting in the 
diagnosis, this is of little clinical significance. Jaundice alters the lipid 
composition of the red cell membrane, masking the red cell morphology, 
and reducing hemolysis, but iron overload and hypersplenism are less 
frequent in HS."

most likely initiated this woman's acute illness?
a. Quinacrine use
b. Parvovirus infection
c. Decreased oxygen tension
d. Exposure to cold
e. Transfusion therapy","Ans. e. Transfusion therapy
The clinical picture of the patient fits more in acute transfusion 
reaction. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired 
or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are 
autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated 
hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to 
malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. 
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane 
is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and 
appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and 
babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, 
membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. 
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in 
the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized 
by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. 
Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized 
by chronic hemolysis.
Acute transfusion reactions present with adverse signs or symptoms 
during or within 24 hours of a blood transfusion. The most frequent 
reactions are fever, chills, pruritus, or urticaria, which typically resolve 
promptly without specific treatment or complications. Other signs 
occurring in temporal relationship with a blood transfusion, such as severe 
shortness of breath, red urine, high fever, or loss of consciousness may be 
the first indication of a more severe potentially fatal reaction. Transfusion 
431
case Based questions
reactions require immediate recognition, laboratory investigation, and 
clinical management. If a transfusion reaction is suspected during blood 
administration, then stop the transfusion and keep the intravenous line 
open with 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline). The transfusion reactions 
may be early or late and may be hemolytic or non-hemolytic. Though the 
history of blood transfusion is not provided in the question, the clinical 
picture presented here fits best in the post-transfusion hemolytic reaction. 
PRCA usually does not present with high fever and jaundice. History 
of drug exposure is also important to rule out drug induced hemolytic 
anemia.
Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) is rare, and less 
common than drug induced thrombocytopenia and leucopenia, and it 
can be mild or associated with acute severe hemolytic anemia and death. 
About 125 drugs have been implicated as the cause. The HA can be caused 
by drug-independent antibodies that are indistinguishable, in vitro and 
in vivo, from autoantibodies causing idiopathic warm type autoimmuune 
hemolytic anemia (AIHA). More commonly, the antibodies are drug 
dependent (i.e., will only react in vitro in the presence of the drug). The 
most common drugs to cause DIIHA are anti-microbials (e.g., cefotetan, 
ceftriaxone and piperacillin), which are associated with drug-dependent 
antibodies.
Cold agglutinins (CA) are antibodies that agglutinate erythrocytes at an 
optimum temperature of 0–4 °C. Cold agglutinin disease is diagnosed 
when the following criteria are met: chronic hemolysis, CA titre more 
than 64 at 4 °C and typical findings by the direct antiglobulin test (DAT). 
The typical DAT pattern is defined as a positive polyspecific test with 
monospecific test positive for complement protein C3d and negative (or 
occasionally weakly positive) for IgG reasonable criteria for initiating drug 
therapy are symptom-producing anemia, transfusion dependence, or 
disabling circulatory symptoms,  the ischemic symptoms may sometimes 
be sufficiently disabling to justify therapy even if the hemolysis is fully 
compensated. Peripheral cyanosis can be managed by maintaining warm 
surroundings."

platelet count 170,000/microliter, and WBC count 52,000/microliter. 
Examination of his peripheral blood smear shows large blasts with 
Auer rods. Which of the following risk factors most likely preceded 
development of his current illness?
a. Malaria
b. Infectious mononucleosis
c. Diabetes mellitus
d. Beta-thalassemia
e. Myelodysplasia","Ans. e. Myelodysplasia
Out of all the options only myelodysplasia can lead to secondary AML. 
Secondary acute myeloid leukemia may arise from the previous clonal 
disorder of hematopoiesis, usually from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
or from chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia (cMPN) or after exposure 
to a leukemogenic agent (previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, some 
immunosuppressive drugs or environmental leukemogenic agents). 
Secondary origin of AML is associated with unfavorable prognosis and 
it is not considered to be conventionally curable (with the exception of 
432 Mcqs in Hematology
secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia).  Patients with secondary AML 
are older and less commonly treated with curative intention than those 
with primary AML. According to cytogenetic findings, their prognosis 
is often worse. Complete hematologic remission is achieved with a low 
probability, relapse of the disease occurs frequently and overall survival 
is worse in almost all prognostic subgroup."

megakaryocytic hyperplasia. Which of the following is the most likely 
diagnosis?
a. Epstein-Barr virus infection
b. Myeloproliferative disorder
c. Drug reaction to recent antibiotic therapy
d. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
e. Megaloblastic anemia","Ans. b Myeloproliferative disorder 
Ref: William’s 8/e p1896
EBV infection usually present in childhood with mononucleosis with 
presence of atypical lymphoid cells in PS. Thrombocytopenia is seen and 
not the thrombocytosis. Drug reaction will not have myeloid hyperplasia 
in marrow. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome will have microthrombocytopenia, 
eczema, recurrent infections, T-cell deficiency and increased risk of 
auto-immune and lymphoproliferative disorders. It usually present in 
childhood. Megaloblastic anemia will have cytopenia and moreover 
bone marrow will show megaloblastosis in erythroid lineages. Platelet 
dysfunction is known to occur in myeloproliferative neoplasms.  
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem 
cells disorders characterized by proliferation of one or more myeloid cell 
lines (granulocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast cells). Arterial 
thrombosis, which accounts for about 60% of events related to MPNs, 
includes ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and peripheral 
arterial occlusion. MPNs are also the most common cause of splanchnic 
venous thromboses, accounting for approximately 50% of Budd Chiari 
syndrome cases and 25% of portal vein thromboses. MPNs associated with 
Budd Chiari syndrome and portal vein thromboses have certain  unique 
features compared to classic MPNs, including the onset at a younger age, 
female predominance in PV, and the presence of normal blood counts, 
which sometimes renders the diagnosis of MPN quite challenging. 
Conversely, extreme thrombocytosis (i.e. platelets more than 1500,000/
micl) can favor hemorrhagic rather than thrombotic manifestations in 
MPN. This paradox has been attributed to the possible occurrence of an 
acquired VWD due to an increased clearance by platelets of the large 
circulating VWF multimers. Even if platelet count is normal the platelets 
are dysfunctional to certain extent."
"A clinical study is performed with subjects who are adults found 
to have anemia. Their clinical histories and laboratory findings 
are reviewed. It is observed that ingestion of a drug preceded 
development of the anemia in some of the subjects, but not in others. 
Which of the following conditions is most likely to be found in persons 
without a history of drug ingestion?
a. G6PD deficiency
415
case Based questions
b. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
c. Macrocytic anemia
d. Aplastic anemia
e. Microcytic anemia","Ans. e Microcytic anemia 
Ref: William’s 8/e p467, 545, 661
The first four type of anemias can be seen after drug ingestion, but 
microcytic type of anemia is not caused by any type of drug. Many type of 
drugs are implicated in the precipitation of anemia in G6PD deficiency. 
Drugs causing macrocytic anemia are DHFR inhibitors, anti-metabolites, 
anti-convulsants, OCPs, etc. Many drugs are also known to cause AIHA. 
Chloramphenicol is implicated in causing aplastic anemia.

"A 25-year-old African-American man is given anti-malarial 
prophylaxis for a trip to West Africa. Over the next week he develops 
increasing fatigue. On physical examination there are no abnormal 
findings. Laboratory studies show a hematocrit of 30%. Examination 
of his peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with numerous 
Heinz bodies. There is a family history of this disorder, with males, 
but not females, affected. Which of the following is the most likely 
diagnosis?
a. Beta-thalassemia
b. Sickle cell anemia
c. Alpha-thalassemia
d. Hereditary spherocytosis
e. G6PD deficiency","Ans. e. G6PD deficiency 
Ref William’s 8/e p656, 661
The clue to the diagnosis is the drug induced hemolytic anemia with 
Heinz bodies and the most importantly positive family history with only 
male persons affected. Glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
deficiency is one of the most common enzyme deficiency in humans. 
It is inherited as an X-recessive linked disorder. G6PD deficiency is 
polymorphic, with more than 300 variants. G6PD deficiency can present 
as neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Persons with this disorder can experience 
episodes of brisk hemolysis in response to oxidative stresses or, less 
commonly, have chronic hemolysis. However, many individuals with 
G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic."
"A study is conducted to determine what changes in the size of the 
spleen take place with hematologic disorders. The spleen sizes 
are estimated from CT scans for adult patients who developed 
complications of their hematologic disease. For which of the 
following diseases is the spleen most likely to remain normal in size?
a. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
b. Chronic alcohol abuse
c. Myeloproliferative disorder
d. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
e. Sickle cell anemia","Ans. d. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 
 
 
Ref: Harrison’s 17/e p855
AIHA, Chronic alcohol abuse and myeloproliferative disorders are all 
associated with increase in spleen size. Repeated micro-infarctions can 
destroy tissues having micro-vascular beds prone to sickling. The spleen 
is frequently lost within the first 18–36 months of life, causing increased 
risk of infections. Presence of splenomegaly rules out the diagnosis of 
IPT and aplastic anemia."
"A 51-year-old man has become increasingly fatigued for the past 10 
months. On physical examination there are no abnormal findings. 
Laboratory studies show his Hgb is 9.2 g/dl, Hct 27.9%, MCV 132 fL, 
platelet count 242,000/microliter, and WBC count 7590/microliter. 
Which of the following morphologic findings is most likely to be 
present on examination of his peripheral blood smear?
a. Hypersegmented neutrophils
b. Nucleated red blood cells
c. Blasts with Auer rods
d. Hypochromic, microcytic RBCs
e. Schistocytes","Ans. a. Hypersegmented neutrophils
This patient is having macrocytic anemia (high MCV) without any 
significant abnormal finding on examination so the answer will be 
megaloblastic anemia. The etiology of the megaloblastic anemias is 
impaired DNA synthesis and assembly. The most common causes are 
vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or folic acid deficiencies. These substances 
are essential in the DNA synthesis pathway. The finding of significant 
macrocytosis (MCV > 100fL) suggests the presence of a megaloblastic 
anemia. Other causes of macrocytes are hemolysis with increased 
reticulocytes, liver disease, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, and aplastic 
anemia; however, the macrocytes in these conditions are round, not oval. 
If the MCV is over 120 fL, the patient is most likely to have a megaloblastic 
anemia. The neutrophils may show hypersegmentation. The finding 
of one neutrophil with 6 lobes signifies megaloblastic anemia (normal 
neutrophils have 2–4 lobes). Large or bizarre misshapen platelets are 
usually present."
"A 72-year-old man has been feeling tired for the past 8 months. On

239,000/uL, and WBC count 7500/uL with automated differential 
count of 70.1% neutrophils, 18.8% lymphocytes, and 11.1% 
monocytes. His total bilirubin is 1.0 mg/dL. Which of the following 
morphologic findings is most likely to be seen on his peripheral blood 
smear?
a. Fragmentation
b. Many nucleated forms
c. Hypochromasia
d. Spherocytosis
e. Howell-Jolly bodies","Ans. c. Hypochromasia 
Ref: William’s 8/e p573
This elderly gentleman is having microcytic anemia which could most 
likely be due to iron deficiency because of chronic GI blood loss. 
Fragmented RBCs, spherocytes and nRBCs are all associated with mild 
indirect hyperbilirubinemia (in this case total bilirubin is normal). 
434 Mcqs in Hematology
Howell-Jolly bodies are seen after splenectomy and there is no history 
of splenectomy. In men and in postmenopausal women, iron deficiency 
is most commonly caused by chronic bleeding from the gastrointestinal 
tract. Anisocytosis is an early and prominent finding in iron deficiency, 
often detectable before significant microcytosis and hypochromia 
develops. Red cell distribution width is a measure of anisocytosis and an 
increased RDW suggests a state of increased anisocytosis as seen early 
in iron deficiency anemi."
"A 19-year-old primigravida of Southeast Asian ancestry gives birth at 
35 weeks gestation a male infant. On physical examination the infant 
is markedly hydropic. Laboratory studies show his hematocrit is 17% 
and the peripheral blood smear reveals numerous nucleated red 
blood cells and even a few erythroblasts. The red blood cells display 
marked anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. Which of the following 
diseases is most likely to be present in this infant?
a. Sickle cell anemia
b. Alpha-thalassemia
c. Hemoglobin E disease
d. G6PD deficiency
e. Hereditary elliptocytosis","Ans. b. Alpha thalassemia 
Ref: William’s 8/e p636, 694
This patient presented with anemia at birth with microcytosis, nRBCs 
and anisopoikilocytosis in peripheral blood. Out of the options 
mentioned, Hemoglobin E disease and sickle cell disease do not present 
at birth. G6PD and hereditary elliptocytosis can rarely present at birth. 
Hereditary elliptocytosis is uncommon in the neonatal period. Typically, 
elliptocytosis does not appear on the blood film until the patient is 4 to 
6 months old. Occasionally, severe forms of hereditary elliptocytosis 
present in the neonatal period with severe, hemolytic anemia with marked 
poikilocytosis and jaundice. Alpha thalassemia is a frequent cause of 
stillbirth in Southeast Asia. Infants either are stillborn at 34 to 40 weeks of 
gestation or are born alive but die within the first few hours. Pallor, edema 
and hepatosplenomegaly are seen."
"A 46-year-old man has had worsening arthritis and swelling of his feet

platelet count 255,500/uL, and WBC count 5920/uL. His serum iron 
is 406 microgram/mL with iron binding capacity 440 microgram/

diagnosis?
a. Beta-thalassemia
b. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
c. Anemia of chronic disease
d. Polycythemia vera
e. Pernicious anemia
f. Hereditary hemochromatosis","Ans. f. Hereditary hemochromatosis 
 
 
Ref: William’s 8/e p593-94,Bacon BR, Diagnosis and Management of 
Hemochromatosis, Hepatology 2011
This patient is having arthropathy, normal Hb with high serum iron, TIBC 
and serum ferritin with cardiomegaly and features of heart failure. All 
these features point towards hereditary hemochromatosis. Other most 
important differential diagnosis mentioned in the options is anemia 
of chronic disease, but this is not the answer as there is no anemia and 
serum iron and TIBC will be low. AIHA will have anemia and spherocytes 
in the peripheral smear. Beta thalassemia does not present at this age. 
Pernicious anemia will present as macrocytic anemia. Hb value is not 
suggestive of polycythemia. 
Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common condition in which 
excessive iron absorption leads to greatly increased body iron stores. 
The deposition of iron occurs in parenchymal cells of the liver, heart, 
pancreas and other organs. In the majority of patients with overt hereditary 
haemochromatosis, the first symptoms develop between the ages of 30 and 
60 years. Approximately 85–90% of patients who have inherited forms of 
iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE gene. The 
clinical manifestations can include the triad of cirrhosis, diabetes, and skin 
435
case Based questions
pigmentation (so-called ‘‘bronze diabetes’’). Liver biopsy is recommended 
to stage the degree of liver disease in C282Y homozygotes or compound 
heterozygotes if liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are elevated or if ferritin is 
>1000 lg/L. If there is no family history but hereditary hemochromatosis 
is suspected, the most useful tests are fasting transferrin saturation and 
serum ferritin. The transferrin saturation (ratio of serum iron and iron 
binding capacity) reflects increased absorption of iron, which is the 
underlying biological defect in hereditary hemochromatosis. A fasting 
transferrin saturation > 45% is the most sensitive test for hereditary 
hemochromatosis and it is unlikely if the ferritin is very high but the 
transferrin saturation is normal. Siblings of individuals with HH, or 
siblings of unaffected C282Y homozygotes, have at least a 25% chance 
of having the same genotype, and 50% chance of being a carrier for the 
HFE mutation."

Which of the following laboratory test findings is most likely to be 
present in this man?
a. High leukocyte alkaline phosphatase
b. Karyotype with 46, XY, t(9;22)
c. Monoclonal gammopathy
d. Elevated D-dimer
e. Positive TdT assay","Ans. a. Elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase 
 
 
Ref: See explanation to Q no 4
This patient is having active pulmonary tuberculosis with high TLC and left 
shift in differential count suggestive leukemoid reaction. So his LAP score 
will be high. In CML LAP score will be low so option b is wrong. PS is also 
not suggestive of any lymphoid malignancy so option e will also be wrong. 
Elevated D-Dimer is suggestive of DIC but this patient is not having any 
feature of DIC such as low platelet or schistocytes on peripheral smear. 
Monoclonal gammopathy will have anemia and rouleaux formation in 
peripheral smear."
"A 5-year-old boy has become increasingly lethargic for the past 2
