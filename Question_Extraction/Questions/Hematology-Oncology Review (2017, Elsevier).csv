Question,Answer,Explanation
The multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype is a well-   established mechanism of cellular drug resistance. Which  one of the following statements is true regarding this re - sistance mechanism?,E,"The multidrug resistance (mdr) gene encodes a P 170 gly coprotein whose function is to cause efflux of drug out of the cell, which results in reduced intracellular accumula tion of drug within the cell. This mechanism is a well es tablished mechanism for a wide range of unrelated classes of drugs, which include anthracyclines, taxanes, campto thecins, and the vinca alkaloids."
"A 55-year-old male with newly diagnosed stage IV colo - rectal cancer and widespread metastatic involvement of  the liver and lungs has been started on FOLFIRI chemo - therapy in combination with the anti-VEGF antibody  bevacizumab. Within 4 days of receiving his first cycle of  therapy, he begins to note increased oral discomfort with  a number of new mouth sores, —six to seven loose stools  per day, repeat CBC shows significant myelosuppression  with neutropenia, and the patient’s wife states that her  husband’s mental status appears to be markedly altered  from his normal baseline. Which of the following enzymes  is most likely altered in this patient?",C,"This is a classic presentation of the DPD deficiency in which there is either partial or complete deficiency in DPD. In this setting, patients present with severe toxici ties in the form of myelosuppression, GI toxicity with diar rhea, mucositis, nausea/vomiting, and neurotoxicity with altered mental status, lethargy, and/or encephalopathy."
Which one of the following statements is correct?,C,"To date, more than 30 sequence variations in the DPD gene have been identified, with the most well established variant being DPD*2A (c.1905 + 1G > A; IVS14+11G.A; rs3918290). This is a single nucleotide variant at the intron boundary of exon 14 that results in a splicing defect, skip ping of the entire exon, and a completely inactive protein. The other DPD variants that are associated with reduced DPD enzyme activity and increased 5 FU toxicity include DPD *5, DPD *6, DPD *9A, DPD *13 (c.1679T > G; I560S; rs55886062), c.2846A > T (D949V; rs67376798), c.1236G > A (E412E; rs56038477). It has now been well established that not all DPD mutations are associated with DPD deficiency. In fact, there are some mutations that lead to increased DPD expression and activity. In up to 40% of patients who present with the class symptoms of DPD deficiency, muta tions in the DPD gene have yet to be identified."
Bevacizumab exerts its antiangiogenic effects by binding  to which one of the VEGF ligands?,A,"Bevacizumab binds to only the VEGF A ligand, of which there are 6 isoforms. In contrast, ziv aflibercept binds to VEGF A, VEGF B, and PlGF."
Treatment with panitumumab is associated with which  electrolyte abnormality?,D,"Treatment with anti EGFR antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, is associated with magnesium wasting with inappropriate urinary excretion, which then leads to Cancer Chemotherapy 10 hypomagnesemia. EGFR is strongly expressed in the kidney, especially in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where up to 70% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed. In patients being treated with anti EGFR antibody therapy, serum mag nesium levels need to be routinely measured and repleted as necessary."
A 49-year-old white female is diagnosed with stage III  colon cancer. She is diabetic and has impaired kidney  function with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 35 mL/ min. She has decided to be treated with the XELOX com - bination regimen. Which of the following statements is  correct?,B,"Capecitabine and capecitabine metabolites are cleared by the kidneys, and increased toxicity has been observed with capecitabine therapy in the presence of renal impairment. The capecitabine dose does not need to be dose reduced when the CrCl is greater than 50 mL/min. The dose of capecitabine needs to be reduced by 25% when the CrCl is between 30 and 50 mL/min. Capecitabine is contraindicated and should not be administered when the CrCl is less than 30 mL/min."
A 49-year-old white female is diagnosed with stage III co - lon cancer. She is diabetic and has impaired kidney func - tion with a CrCl of 35 mL/min. She has decided to be  treated with the XELOX combination regimen. Which of  the following is true relating to oxaliplatin dosing?,A,"As with other platinum agents, oxaliplatin is excreted by the kidneys. However, renal dysfunction studies have shown no increase in pharmacodynamic drug related tox icities in patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction and CrCl down to 20 mL/min. No formal studies have been conducted to date in patients with CrCl <20 mL/min, and in this setting of severe renal dysfunction, oxaliplatin should not be administered"
Which of the following statements about the platinum  agents is correct?,E,"The DNA lesions are similar for cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin with formation of both inter and intrastrand crosslinks. With respect to safety profile, carboplatin is less nephrotoxic and less emetogenic than cisplatin, but signifi cantly more myelosuppressive than cisplatin. The resist ance mechanisms for cisplatin and carboplatin are identi cal. However, in the presence of mismatch repair defects where cisplatin and carboplatin resistance develops, sen sitivity to oxaliplatin is maintained, which explains the ef ficacy of oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer and other GI can cers where mismatch repair defects have been identified. Oxaliplatin can be safely administered to patients with ab normal function with CrCl down to as low as 20 mL/min"
"A 64-year-old patient with early-stage node-positive ER+  breast cancer is about to start on tamoxifen for her adju - vant therapy. She has a long-standing history of depres -CHAPTER 3 Cancer Chemotherapy Edward ChuSECTION 2Anti-Cancer TherapiesCancer Chemotherapy 8 sion for the past 18 years and has been on paroxetine. Her  depressive symptoms have been well controlled, and she  believes that she needs to continue with antidepressive  therapy. Which one of the following liver microsomal en - zymes is responsible for tamoxifen metabolism?",C,"Tamoxifen is a prodrug that is activated by the liver micro somal system and specifically CYP2D6 to form endoxifen and other active metabolites. In patients, the activity of this enzyme can be highly variable leading to variations in the levels of the active metabolites of tamoxifen. Patients can have reduced CYP2D6 activity because of their genotype of by coadministration of drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 func tion. In both cases, there is reduced formation of endox ifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen, which then leads to inferior clinical benefit from tamoxifen."
"In a breast cancer patient who is on adjuvant tamoxifen  therapy, which one of the following is the most appropri - ate treatment option for her depression?",E,"Tamoxifen is a prodrug that is activated by the liver micro somal system and specifically CYP2D6 to form the active metabolite endoxifen. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 can lead to a reduced formation of the active metabolites. Antidepressant agents, including St. John’s wort, duloxetine, fluoxetine, par oxetine, bupropion, and sertraline, are inhibitors of CYP2D6, which can then interfere and inhibit tamoxifen metabolism, leading to lower blood levels of the active tamoxifen metabo lites."
Which one of the following statements is true relating to  sorafenib therapy?,D,"Sorafenib is metabolized in the liver primarily by the CY P3A4 microsomal enzymes. As a result, there are a number of important drug drug interactions with sorafenib therapy. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, may re duce the metabolism of sorafenib leading higher drug levels and potentially increased toxicity. Drugs, such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine, increase the metabolism of sorafenib leading to reduced drug lev els and potentially reduced clinical benefit. Seville oranges, grapefruit products, starfruit, and pomelos contain sub stances that inhibit the liver metabolism of sorafenib, which can then lead to increased drug levels and potentially in creased toxicity. Sorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1, and caution must be used when sorafenib is administered with agents that are metabolized by UGT1A1, such as irinotecan. Sorafenib is rapidly absorbed after an oral dose. The general recommendation is to take sorafenib without food at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating, as oral bioavailability is affected by food. In particular, foods with a high fat content reduce oral bioavailability by as much as 30%."
"6 g/dL, prothrombin time  is elevated to 18 seconds, and there is no ascites. Over - all, he is determined to have moderate liver impairment  (Child-Pugh class B). Which one of the following state - ments is true?",C,"Grapefruit products, Seville oranges, starfruit, and pomelos should be avoided, as these food products can impair liver metabolism of everolimus, which then leads to increased drug levels. There is a drug drug interaction between St. John’s wort and everolimus where St. John’s wort can in crease everolimus metabolism in the liver, resulting in lower effective drug levels. Food with a high fat content reduces oral bioavailability by up to 20%. Patients are at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, including fun gal infections, while on everolimus therapy. Metabolism of everolimus occurs mainly in the liver the CYP3A4 enzymes, and elimination of drug is mainly hepatic with excretion in feces. In patients with moderate liver impairment (Child Pugh class B), the everolimus dose should be reduced to 5 mg daily, and in the setting of severe liver impairment (Child Pugh class C), everolimus therapy should not be given."
"A 65-year-old female patient with metastatic HER2- positive disease is being treated with the combination  of capecitabine and trastuzumab. Of note, she has a his - tory of ischemic heart disease, but she has not had any  cardiac symptoms for the past 2 years. She has been on  therapy for 8 months and is tolerating this combination  regimen well with no symptoms. Computed tomogra - phy (CT) scans were just performed, and they confirm  a nice response to therapy. A follow-up multigated ac - quisition scan to assess her cardiac status shows a 20%  reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  from a normal baseline. Which one of the following  statements is true?",D,Careful baseline assessment of cardiac function (LVEF) must be done prior to the start of trastuzumab therapy with frequent monitoring (every 2–3 months) while on therapy. Trastuzumab should be held if there is an abso lute reduction in LVEF by greater than 16% from a normal baseline value. Trastuzumab should be stopped immedi ately in any patient who develops clinically significant symptoms of congestive heart failure.
"A patient with metastatic osteogenic sarcoma is about to  start treatment with high-dose methotrexate (MTX). With  respect to the extent of his disease, the patient has multiple  pulmonary nodules, mediastinal lymph node, and a ma - lignant left pleural effusion. He complains of lower back  pain, unrelated to his underlying cancer, which is well  controlled on indomethacin. Which one of the following is  the most appropriate intervention?",D,"MTX is cleared by the kidneys, and the process of renal ex cretion is inhibited in the presence of aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, penicillins, cephalosporins, and probenecid. MTX distributes in to third space fluid collec tions, such as pleural effusions and ascites, and the fluid collections should be drained prior to the start of MTX, as they can cause a delay in drug clearance. In the presence of these fluid collections, patients may experience increased toxicity. Vigorous intravenous hydration with alkaliniza tion of the urine to a pH of greater than 7.0 is required to prevent precipitation of MTX and MTX polyglutamates in acidic urine, which can then lead to renal failure. The rationale for leucovorin rescue is to protect normal cells from MTX toxicity. Leucovorin should be given until the serum MTX levels are down to 50 nM, and once below that threshold level, leucovorin rescue can be stopped."
Which one of the following statements is true relating to  pertuzumab?,B,"Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 mono clonal antibody direct against the extracellular domain (subdomain II) of the HER2 neu growth factor recep tor. It binds to a different epitope on HER2 neu receptor Cancer Chemotherapy 11 than trastuzumab, which binds to subdomain IV . Binding of pertuzumab to the HER2 neu receptor leads to inhibi tion of heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER fam ily members, including EGFR, HER3, and HER"
A patient with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung  cancer is being treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin. Which  one of the following is the most appropriate treatment option?,D,"Patients who receive pemetrexed based therapy should receive vitamin supplementation with folic acid (350 μg/ day) and vitamin B12 (1000 μg IM every 3 cycles) to reduce the risk and severity of toxicity while on therapy. Steroids have been shown to reduce the development of skin rash, and dexamethasone (4 mg PO bid) can be given for 3 days beginning the day before starting pemetrexed."
"A 45-year-old male patient with metastatic colorectal can - cer is being treated in the second-line setting with FOLFIRI  plus cetuximab. One week after his initial treatment, the  patient presents with a 2-day history of increasing fatigue  and an absolute neutrophil count of 500/ μL. What is the  most likely diagnosis?",C,"DPD deficiency presents with severe toxicity to 5 FU with the classic triad of myelosuppression, GI toxicity, and neu rotoxicity. This patient presents with isolated myelosup pression, which would be unusual for DPD deficiency. Irinotecan is metabolized by UDP glucuronyltransferase, and the process of glucuronidation leads to inactive me tabolites of both irinotecan and SN 38. In patients with the UGT1A1*28 genotype, there is significant reduction in iri notecan and SN 38 glucuronidation, which then leads to increased myelosuppression and/or GI toxicity. Approxi mately 10% of the North American population is homozy gous for this specific genotype."
"A 46-year-old male patient with primary CNS lympho - ma is presently receiving high-dose MTX. He receives  leucovorin rescue according to protocol, and serum  MTX levels are being closely monitored. Which one of  the following best describes when leucovorin rescue can  be safely stopped?",D,"The rationale for leucovorin rescue is to protect normal cells from MTX toxicity. Leucovorin should be given un til the serum MTX levels below 50 nM (5 × 10−8 M), and once below that threshold level, leucovorin rescue can be stopped."
"A patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma is being treated with  the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and  rituximab. Which one of the following statements is true?",D,"Fludarabine is a prodrug, and following administration, it is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2 fluoro ara adenosine. This nucleoside then enters the cells via a nucleoside mediated process, and it is then initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form and eventually metabolized to the fludarabine triphosphate form, which is the active cytotoxic metabolite. Both fludarabine and cyclophos phamide are renally excreted. In the presence of renal dysfunction, the doses of fludarabine and cyclophospha mide need to be modified. Dose modification of fludara bine is not required in the setting of liver dysfunction. Fludarabine therapy is associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis cari nii, and patients should be empirically placed on bactrim prophylaxis."
A patient with end-stage renal disease and multiple mye - loma is being treated with single-agent bortezomib. Which  one of the following statements is true?,C,"The multidrug resistance (mdr) gene encodes a P 170 gly coprotein whose function is to cause efflux of drug out of the cell, which results in reduced intracellular accumula tion of drug within the cell. This mechanism is a well es tablished mechanism for a wide range of unrelated classes of drugs, which include anthracyclines, taxanes, campto thecins, and the vinca alkaloids."
"1 mg/dL,  and uric acid less than 4 mg/dL. Which one of the follow - ing is the most appropriate cause of her hyponatremia?",C,"In patients with dehydration and underlying kidney dis ease, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and/or creatinine lev els should be elevated. With adrenal insufficiency, patients present with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In renal tubular acidosis, the bicarbonate levels are reduced along with an elevation in chloride levels and a reduction in po tassium levels. SIADH presents with hyponatremia and normal potassium, chloride, BUN/creatinine levels. Several anticancer agents are associated with SIADH, including the vinca alkaloids, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and melpha lan. While SIADH has been observed with certain tumor types, the most common being small cell lung cancer, Hodg kin lymphoma is not normally associated with SIADH."
A deficiency in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) re - sults in significantly increased toxicity to which one of the  following agents?,C,"A partial or complete deficiency of TPMT results in ex cessive, severe toxicity with myelosuppression, GI toxic ity, and/or neurotoxicity, in response to the thiopurines, 6 mercaptopurine and 6 thioguanine. TPMT is not in volved in the metabolism of other purine analogs, such as nelarabine, cladribine, and fludarabine."
"A 38-year-old male with newly diagnosed metastatic  colorectal cancer is started on mFOLFOX6 plus bevaci - zumab. There was a miscalculation in the chemotherapy  orders, and he was given a 20-fold higher dose of 5-FU in  the 46-hour infusion. Which of the following is the most  appropriate treatment intervention?",D,"The administration of uridine triacetate (vistonuridine), an oral prodrug form of uridine, has been shown to be a safe and effective antidote to 5 FU overdose, and this agent was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. 5 FU cannot be removed by hemodi alysis, and it is not known whether peritoneal dialysis can be used to remove circulating 5 FU. Leucovorin and glucarpidase are two agents that have been used to pre vent and/or rescue against MTX associated toxicities but would not be able to prevent the toxicities of 5 FU."
Which of the following tyrosine kinases are inhibited by  crizotinib?,E,"Crizotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinases associated with c Met, ALK, RON, and ROS1. This agent is now approved in the United States to treat patients with metastatic non small cell lung cancer whose tumors are ALK positive or ROS1 positive."
Which reduced folate is part of the TS ternary complex?,A,"The TS ternary complex is made up of the 5 FU metabolite FdUMP , the reduced folate 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate, and the TS enzyme. The role of the reduced folate is to en hance the inhibitory effect of the 5 FU metabolite in inhibi tion of TS. When TS is bound in this ternary complex, TS en zymatic activity is optimally inhibited, leading to inhibition of thymidylate synthesis and subsequent inhibition of DNA biosynthesis. Leucovorin is 5 formyltetrahydrofolate, which is eventually metabolized within the cell to 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate."
"According to the “cancer stem cell” hypothesis, which of  the following characteristics does a subpopulation of can - cer cells in a tumor have",D,"The cancer stem cell hypothesis postulates that only a subpopulation of cancer cells can maintain self renewal, proliferation, and specialized differentiation within a heterogeneous tumor. This is in contrast to the clonal evolution hypothesis, that every cell within a neoplas tic mass was capable of these listed traits. Cancer stem cells have characteristic stem cell markers that are not present on other cancer cells within the tumor. These have been described in solid tumors and hematological malignancies."
Which of the following accurately describes the process of  splicing,C,"Splicing refers to the process of removal of the noncoding sequences of DNA to form a continuous chain of exons to eventually undergo translation into protein. This process requires precision as any alteration can result in aberrant protein formation and disease, including cancer."
All of the following are methods to detect single nucleo - tide polymorphisms except:  ,D,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) constitute the most common form of genetic variation in humans. Modern methods in molecular biology have the capability of detect ing a large number of SNPs that exist within the genome. All of the tests listed can detect SNPs, except Western blotting, which is used to detect proteins within the analyzed sample."
Which of the following is the correct sequence of gene ex - pression,A,"Gene expression is a highly regulated process that starts with transcription of mRNA to form a copy of the gene, followed by removal of the noncoding sequences called introns (splicing), and finally translation into proteins. Al ternate splicing can result into translation of multiple iso forms of protein from the same gene.Cancer Biology 3"
Which of the following was the first antiangiogenic agent to  receive regulatory approval for use in patients with cancer,C,"Bevacizumab was first approved for patients with meta static colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Since then, several other agents have entered the clinic and are used commonly in the management of kidney cancer, non small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glio blastoma, and others."
Which of the following is/are cellular mechanisms in - volved in the vascularization of tumors,E,"All of the listed mechanisms are involved with the vas cularization of tumors. Initially, tumor cells grow around existing vasculature (co opt) to form cuffs around the mi cro circulation. Intussusception refers to the enlargement of tumor vessels in response to tumor related growth fac tors and the creation of an interstitial tissue column in the enlarged lumen. Expansion of the existing vascular network and proliferation of the endothelial cells to form a “bridge” or “sprout” with subsequent canalization con stitutes the process of sprouting. Finally, mobilization of endothelial precursor cells from the bone marrow by the process of vasculogenesis also contributes to vasculariza tion within tumors."
Which of the following are class effects of antiangiogenic  agents,E,"Hypertension, arterial and venous thrombosis, and myo cardial ischemia can be seen with all available inhibitors of angiogenesis. In addition, proteinuria can be seen with this class of agents as well. Several other side effects are unique to each agent. However, gastrointestinal toxicity is not a commonly reported adverse event from these drugs."
"In the invasion process of cancer metastasis, cells need to  detach themselves from neighboring cells. Which of the  following mediates the function of cell-cell adhesion",A,"E cadherin proteins are responsible for mediated adhesion between cells through protein protein interactions at the cell surface. An alteration of the expression of E cadherin permits disassociation of cells and initiates the process of metastatic invasion. Truncating mutations in the E cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) have been associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, an autosomal dominant familial syndrome."
Which of the following cancers metastasizes primarily via  the transcoelomic route,B,"This pattern of metastasis involving the surface of the peritoneal cavity is most commonly observed with ovar ian cancer. Hematogenous and lymphatic dissemination also occur in ovarian cancer, though less frequently. In the transcoelomic metastatic process, tumor cells first detach from the primary tumor site to enter the peritoneal fluid where they must resist anoikis and immune mediated de struction. This is followed by peritoneal implantation and metastatic growth. If uncontrolled, this is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in ovarian cancer and certain gas trointestinal cancers, such as colon cancer."
Metastases to the brain is common in all of the following  cancers except:  ,C,"Metastasis to the brain is distinctly an uncommon pat tern of spread in prostate cancer where osteoblastic bone metastases are the norm. In all of the other cancers listed, spread to the brain is a major cause of morbidity and mor tality. The etiology of this preferred landing zone for these tumors is not entirely clear."
Which of the following is the correct sequence of events in  cellular division,D,"Cell division is a tightly regulated process. This is initi ated by transition from the G0 (or quiescent) phase to the G1 (first gap) phase. Once the cell crosses the point of “no return” (restriction point), it enters the S (synthesis) phase where chromosome replication takes place. This is followed by the G2 (second gap) phase, and finally mitosis (M phase)."
Which of the following is an example of a protooncogene,C,"MYC is a typical protooncogene and is implicated in the genesis of many cancers, most notably Burkitt lymphoma. All of the others listed are classic tumor suppressor genes."
Which of the following cancers are associated with the   Li-Fraumeni syndrome,E,"The Li Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant inher ited disorder characterized by mutations in the P53 tumor suppressor gene. In addition to the malignancies listed, leuke mia is also seen with higher frequency in this disorder. Some patients with this syndrome lack P53 mutations. Mutations of CHK2 have been observed in a subset of these patients."
"A knockout mouse model of carcinogenesis is character - ized by all of the following attributes, except:  ",C,"Gain of function mutations are best studied by a transgen ic model of cancer where an oncogene is introduced into the mouse genome to further propagate in a dominant pat tern of inheritance. All of the other answers are traits for a knockout model of cancer, which is ideal to understand recessive genetic disorders."
Which of the following is an incorrect statement regarding  RET  (rearranged during transfection) signaling,E,"RET is a proto oncogene required for normal development of the enteric nervous system and the kidney. Following li gand binding, RET dimerization occurs, resulting in phos phorylation of tyrosine residues and subsequent cellular signaling. Mutations in RET for the molecular basis for the spectrum of MEN type 2 syndromes. This is also seen in spo radic medullary thyroid carcinoma. There are several inhibi tors of RET that are approved in clinical practice, including vandetanib and cabozantinib for medullary thyroid cancer."
Which of the following molecular abnormalities are found  in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs),E,"All of those listed are correct. The vast majority (85%) of GISTs harbor activating mutations in CKIT or the platelet derived growth factor receptor. In the remaining “wild type” adult GISTs, recent molecular developments have identified low levels of mitochondrial succinate dehydro genase and high expression of insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). Activation of IGF1R eventually leads to increased cellular proliferation through intermediate acti vation of the mitogen activated protein kinase and PI3K AKT mTOR pathways."
What does the process of anoikis refer to,D,"Anoikis refers to apoptotic cell death induced by detachment of the cell from the extracellular matrix (ECM). This is an im portant process in the development of metastasis as tumor cells overcome adverse proapoptotic interactions with the matrix. These cells have to circumvent other adverse features, including immune attack, hypoxia, etc., in order to survive and propagate. This process was first described in 1993–94."
What is the primary function of cyclin-dependent kinases  (CDKs) in the regulation of the cell cycle,B,"CDKs are responsible for the phosphorylation of proteins in various phases of the cell cycle. The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene controls repression of gene transcription, while the chromosome passenger complex and polo like kinases (Plk1 5) control chromosome segregation. The polo like ki nases are also involved in centrosome function along with NIMA related kinases."
Which of the following cells can suppress the antitumor  immune response,D,"There exists a complex interplay between the cancer cell and the tumor microenvironment. Regulatory T cells and MDSCs can inhibit antitumor cytotoxic T cell responses, thus allowing tumor propagation. A high level of MDSCs has been shown to be a negative prognostic indicator in several tumor subtypes."
All of the following cancers are known to have an etiologi - cal association with microbial infection except:  ,B,"All of the cancers listed, except prostate cancer, are associated with an infectious organism. Kaposi’s sarcoma results from infection with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8). Several lym phoproliferative disorders (both B and T cell) are associated with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Angioimmunoblastic lym phoma is a peripheral T cell lymphoma where EBV has been identified in the B cells present within the tumor as well as within some of the neoplastic T cells. Gastric carcinoma has been linked to infection with Helicobacter pylori while the Mer kel cell polyomavirus is found in the majority of cases of Mer kel cell carcinoma, a rare but aggressive form of skin cancer."
Which of the following statements accurately describes the  process of “immunoediting”,C,"There exists a dynamic interaction between the cancer cell and the host immune response that results in the shaping of the tumor, both in biology and behavior; this constitutes the hy pothesis of immunoediting and consists of three phases (elim ination, equilibrium, and escape). Recent advances in our understanding of this interaction have enabled pre clinical and clinical development of therapeutic strategies to restore immune control and elicit an antitumor immune response."
Which of the following is an anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte  associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody,D,"Ipilimumab is the first and only anti CTLA 4 antibody to re ceive regulatory approval in the immune therapy of cancer. All of the other agents listed, either target the programmed death receptor 1 (PD 1; pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or its ligand PD L1 (avelumab, atezolizumab). These agents have received approval in the United States for the management of one or more cancers."
Which of the following are immunological (antigenic) dif - ferences between normal tissues and tumors,E,"All of the tenets listed are typically seen in tumors com pared to normal cells. Genetic instability results in a large number of mutations within exons of tumor cells, result ing in the production of neoantigens. These effects occur more frequently within the intracellular proteins; circulat ing antibodies do not readily recognize the resulting neo antigens. Similarly, epigenetic differences between tumor cells and normal cells results in the overexpression of a large number of genes in the former relative to the latter."
Which of the following cells has the capacity to directly kill  antigen-presenting cells,A,"Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have T cell receptors (TCRs) that rec ognize antigens on a foreign cell, such as a cancer cell or an infected cell, and initiate the process of destruction of that cell. CD4+ helper T cells play a prominent role in modulat ing the immune response through the secretion of a variety of cytokines. Regulatory T cells and myeloid derived sup pressor cells play important roles in the down regulation of the immune response to pathogens and cancer."
Which of the following statements is true regarding im - mune surveillance,A,"The systematic identification and destruction of tumor cells through the recognition of tumor specific antigens is referred to an immune surveillance. Defects in immune surveillance are purported to result in the development of tumors, so called “progressor” tumors through immune escape or resistance. While inherently it would be assumed that im munodeficient nude mice would have a higher incidence of tumors, this has not proven to be the case, which is likely from a compensatory increase in innate immunity and the production of T cells via pathways that are independent of the thymus. The NKG2D receptor is expressed on NK cells, select T cells, and on subsets of intraepithelial lymphocytes, where it plays a role against invading pathogens in contact with epithelial linings of the gut, the respiratory tract, and the skin, thus being involved with immune surveillance."
On which of the following cells is the CTLA-4 checkpoint  receptor located,D,"The CTLA 4 is an immune checkpoint expressed exclusive ly on several subtypes of T cells including CD4+, CD8+, and T reg cells. It functions as a negative regulator of the im mune response. Inhibition of CTLA 4 by antibodies, such as ipilimumab and tremelimumab, can trigger an immune response with the potential for therapeutic benefit. Ipili mumab is approved for use in patients with advanced un resectable melanoma, and as adjuvant therapy for stage III melanoma, based on the results from phase III trials."
Which of the following immune checkpoint—ligand com - bination is correct,E,"Maintenance of an immunological homeostasis is a closely regulated process with immune checkpoints playing an im portant role. Each of the immune checkpoints listed in the question can inhibit lymphocyte activity. TIM 3 is selective ly expressed on cytokine producing CD4+ helper cells (Th1) and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and functions to limit responses from these cells, both in duration and extent. Galectin 9 is a ligand for TIM 3. There are two known ligands for PD 1: PD L1 and PD L2. Following ligand binding, PD 1 inhibits T cell activation through several mechanisms. Inhibition of PD 1 activity has been one of the major therapeutic ad vances in cancer immunotherapy in the last decade. LAG 3 (CD223) enhances T reg activity and inhibits CD8+ effector T cell function; MHC class II is the only known ligand for LAG 3. The herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) is the li gand for B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); binding can negatively modulate the function of the T cell."
Which of the following statements is accurate regarding  transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- β),D,TGF β is an important cytokine for normal physiological functioning and in pathological states with a variety of ef fects on the microenvironment. Mutations in TGF β can promote the invasive phenotype through the mechanisms outlined. TGF β can effect T reg mediated suppression of CD8 T cell antitumor response.

"What is the mechanism by which indoleamine-2,3 dioxy - genase (IDO) effects unresponsiveness in T-cells",B,"Within the tumor microenvironment, numerous molecules can blunt the immune response. IDO is one of the rate limiting enzymes of the catabolic pathway of tryptophan causing its depletion. This deficiency of tryptophan inhib its T cell responses by causing an arrest in proliferation. A number of IDO inhibitors are currently under investigation in clinical trials, typically in combination with other im mune checkpoint inhibitors, in an attempt to restore and enhance the antitumor response."
"A 60-year-old male with metastatic BRAF V600E mutant  melanoma is treated with dabrafenib plus trametinib. He  tolerates treatment well with intermittent mild fevers and  fatigue. On restaging scans, he has a deep partial response  with reduction in disease burden in the lungs and liver. Lyt - ic bone areas remain stable. His blood work shows a hemo - globin of 9, which is stable from his baseline. There are no  other significant abnormalities on the complete blood count  (CBC) or comprehensive metabolic panel. Four weeks later  on treatment, he develops swelling in his legs, mild dysp - nea on exertion, and more fatigue but is still active. He has  no chest pain. Blood work, including CBC and compre - hensive metabolic panel, are similar to his last visit. What  would you recommend for the management in this patient",C,"Hold trametinib and order an echocardiogram. Past stud ies of MEK inhibitors have reported infrequent but po tentially serious events of cardiomyopathy, left ventricu lar dysfunction, and decreased ejection fraction. In the COMBI d phase III study of dabrafenib plus trametinib, decreased ejection fraction was reported in 4% of patients on the combination. In a patient with signs of heart failure, trametinib should be held and an echocardiogram would be most appropriate."
"5 cm at the left lower lung. No other areas of meta - static disease were identified. Labs were normal including  the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Biopsy of the left  lower lung lesion confirmed metastatic melanoma. BRAF  testing on the tumor specimen identified a BRAF V600E  mutation. Treatment options were reviewed, and the pa - tient chose to pursue BRAF-targeted therapy based on the  recent data showing improved outcomes in patients with  low disease burden and normal LDH. Her oncologist gets  approval for vemurafenib plus cobimetinib and brings her  back to clinic to start treatment and review a magnetic res - onance imaging (MRI) of the brain to complete her staging  workup. The MRI shows a 2-mm lesion in the left frontal  cortex that is a possible metastasis, but there is no prior  comparison. The patient wants to start vemurafenib plus  cobimetinib today. What would be the most appropriate  recommendation",A,"Proceed with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib and repeat MRI in a short interval. In this patient, a new small brain lesion is identified, which could be an early brain metastasis. Prior phase II studies of vemurafenib and dabrafenib have dem onstrated objective responses in active brain metastases in patients with metastatic BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma. Immunotherapy and Pathway Inhibitors 16 There is also direct evidence that BRAF agents do penetrate the blood brain barrier, which is based on cerebrospinal flu id testing. Therefore, in an asymptomatic patient, it would be reasonable to proceed with BRAF targeted therapy and monitor the brain lesion on serial imaging studies. Further more, if the brain lesion did eventually increase in size, this would provide more certainty that it is a brain metastasis, and a radiation oncologist or neurosurgeon should offer definitive treatment. There is no clear data indicating that one BRAF plus MEK inhibitor combination is superior to another."
"A 56-year-old male with stage IV transitional cell blad - der cancer is treated with atezolizumab after progression  platinum-based chemotherapy. At the start of treatment,  he has an ECOG performance status of 1 and has mini - mal symptoms related to his disease. He tolerates therapy  well except for a minor rash that is controlled with topical  corticosteroids. A restaging scan is performed at 9 weeks,  which shows regression in the pelvic adenopathy and sta - ble liver lesions. However, there is an increase in size of  two small lung nodules. He continues to have an ECOG  performance status of 1 and has no new pulmonary symp - toms. What would you recommend for the management of  this patient",C,"Continue atezolizumab. In past clinical studies of anti CTLA 4 and anti PD 1/PD L1 therapies, it has been noted that some patients experience initial progressive disease or mixed responses, followed by disease regression. This has been termed “pseudoprogression,” originating from stud ies of ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma, which occurred in up to 10% of patients. This may be due to delayed tumor regression based on the mechanism of action by immunotherapies and/or an initial increase in tumor size due to inflammation. In the phase II study of atezolizumab in advanced bladder cancer patients, 20 of the 121 (17%) patients treated beyond progression subse quently demonstrated significant responses. Therefore, in this patient with a mixed response and clinical stability, it would be best to continue with atezolizumab until the next restaging scans."
"A 35-year-old female with a history of depression is   diagnosed with T4aN2bM0 (stage IIIB) melanoma from  a primary site on her left shoulder. She is status post  wide-local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and  completion lymph node dissection. She has recovered  well from her surgeries, and staging CT scan of the neck,  chest, abdomen, and pelvis and MRI of the brain show  no evidence of metastatic disease. She is concerned  about the risk of disease relapse and is interested in pur - suing adjuvant immunotherapy. Which immunotherapy  that has demonstrated improvement in relapse-free sur - vival and overall survival would you recommend to this  patient",B,"Ipilimumab. In the EORTC 18071 study, ipilimumab dem onstrated superior relapse free survival and overall survival over placebo in patients with resected stage III melanoma. Of note, grade 3 or higher related adverse events were re ported in over 40% of patients in the ipilimumab arm. Pa tients need to be educated on the potential toxicity risks, and treatment generally should not be offered in patients with active autoimmune disorders or significant comorbidities. In this young patient with only a history of depression, it would be reasonable to offer ipilimumab. The only other option in this list that is Food and Drug Administration ap proved for this indication demonstrating gains in survival, is high dose interferon. However, some studies with inter feron have failed to show an improvement in overall sur vival over the control arm, and depression can occur as a related adverse event."
"A 60-year-old male with stage IIIB non-small cell lung  cancer (NSCLC) was initially treated with combined  chemotherapy and radiation. On restaging scans 6 months  later, he is noted to have new and progressive disease in  the lungs and new liver metastases. He is asymptomatic  and working full-time. A decision is made to start treat - ment with the anti-PD-1 therapy pembrolizumab based  on his tumor’s PD-L1 status. After 12 weeks of therapy,  restaging CT scans show disease regression. The radiolo - gist also comments on a few areas of nonspecific ground  glass opacities in both lungs. On questioning, the patient  does endorse mild dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough  that is new, but he is still able to work. He denies fevers,  sweats, chest pain, or other new symptoms. His resting CHAPTER 4 Immunotherapy and Pathway Inhibitors Geoffrey GibneyImmunotherapy and Pathway Inhibitors 14 and ambulatory oxygen saturation is 98%, and his cardiac  and lung exams are unrevealing. The patient is eager to  continue with pembrolizumab. What is the most appropri - ate course in this patient",C,"Hold pembrolizumab and administer systemic corticoster oids. In this patient, there are radiographic signs and clini cal symptoms of pneumonitis related to the pembrolizum ab therapy. This would be grade 2 by CTCAE reporting. Although other possible diagnoses are not fully ruled out, such as heart failure or infectious pneumonia, they would be unlikely in this patient scenario. An electrocardiogram and serum cardiac enzymes could be obtained to rule out a cardiac etiology. Pneumonitis has been reported in ap proximately 1%–5% of patients treated with anti PD 1 therapy and may be higher in NSCLC patients previously treated with radiation. For grade 2 pneumonitis, anti PD 1 therapy should be held and systemic corticosteroids ad ministered, such as an oral prednisone 1 mg/kg daily dose with a 4–5 week taper."
"A 70-year-old patient with resected stage II melanoma at  the left arm now presents with palpable adenopathy at the  left axilla. Biopsy confirms metastatic melanoma. Staging  CT scans of the torso show pulmonary nodules consist - ent with distant metastatic disease. MRI of the brain is  negative for CNS disease. He is asymptomatic from his  melanoma disease, but he does have a history of coronary  artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and peripheral neuropa - thy. This limits his activities, but he is able to complete  his activities of daily living. His tumor is BRAF wild type.  He wishes to receive effective treatment for his metastatic  melanoma, but he is concerned about the risks of serious  side effects. Which immune therapy would you recom - mend for this patient",B,"Nivolumab. Anti PD 1 therapies, including nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have objective response rates of 40%–45% in the front line setting for patients with advanced melano ma. Clinical activity has proven superior over ipilimumab in randomized phase III studies. Anti PD 1 monotherapy has been associated with a grade 3 or greater adverse event rate of approximately 15% in most studies, which is lower than other immune therapy regimens listed. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab has demonstrated a higher objective re sponse rate and longer progression free survival, but also a grade 3 or greater adverse event rate above 50%."
What other molecular  markers or clinical features are associated with greater clini - cal activity of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with NSCLC and  other malignancies,A,"High mutational burden. Overall, immune checkpoint therapies have demonstrated greater clinical activity in tu mor types with high mutational burden, such as NSCLC and melanoma. This is thought to be due to the generation of neoantigens that are recognized by the immune system and generate a stronger adaptive immune response. This is supported by data showing greater cytolytic T cell activity in tumors with higher mutational and neoantigen burden and the identification of specific T cell subpopulations that recognize individual neoepitopes that are unique to the patient’s tumor."
"A 45-year-old female is diagnosed with metastatic mela - noma of unknown primary after presenting with seizures  and undergoing craniotomy to resect a 2 cm right parietal  mass. She recovered from her surgery and has no further  seizures or neurologic deficits. Staging scans of the torso  show metastatic disease in the liver and several lytic bone  lesions. She reads her pathology report and sees that the  tumor stained positive for GP100, MART-1, and S100—all  common melanoma markers. She wishes to be aggressive  in the treatment of her cancer and receive immunotherapy  that is specific to targeting her tumor type. She inquires if  she could receive a GP100 vaccine combined with an anti- PD-1 drug after reading about this on the internet. Based  on the available information, which statement is true about  human studies of vaccines in combination with immune  checkpoint blockade therapy",C,"Vaccines in combination with checkpoint therapy do not increase toxicity risks. Efforts so far have failed to dem onstrate improved clinical activity of immune checkpoint therapy when combined with a vaccine. In the phase III study of ipilimumab alone, ipilimumab plus GP100, or GP100 alone, in advanced melanoma patients, there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between the two ipilimumab arms. Furthermore, GP100 monotherapy had minimal clinical activity and the shortest survival. The addition of vaccine in this study and others did not significantly increase the toxicity risks outside of minor lo cal injection site reactions. Similar findings were noted in a phase II single arm study of a multipeptide vaccine plus nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients. In this study, patients were required to be HLA A2 positive (thought to be required for specific melanoma antigen presentation) and positive by immunohistochemistry for at least one of the vaccine peptides included in the treatment. Newer data are suggesting that antigen recognition may be primarily patient specific towards neoantigens existing in the tumor cells, making global vaccine strategies more difficult."
"The development of immune agents as therapeutic strate - gies have ranged from vaccine- and cytokine-based treat - ments to more focused approaches to manipulate targets  within the adaptive immune system in order to modify  antitumor T-cell responses. This can be direct antibody  mediated stimulation or inhibition of immune checkpoints  that augment immune responses, such as the anti-CTLA-4  and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents that are now approved for  a range of malignancies. However, many of these mecha - nisms are important for maintaining appropriate checks  and balances within the immune system for normal func - tions, such as defending against infection, wound healing,  and maternal-fetal tolerance. It is important for providers  to understand these mechanisms when making treatment  recommendations, as they differ significantly from stand - ard chemotherapy agents and have different implications  on patient monitoring. Which of the following is believed  to be the correct mechanism of action for anti-PD-1 thera - pies in cancer",D,"Blocking CD8+ T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvi ronment. PD 1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on a range of immune cells, including CD8+ T cells. It serves as an inhibitory pathway to cause tolerance or T cell ex haustion when it binds to the PD L1 or PD L2 ligand. The PD L1 ligand is frequently expressed on tumor cells in re sponse to cytokines, such as interferon gamma and IL 12. This leads to tumor cell escape or immune tolerance and T cell exhaustion when PD L1 interacts with PD 1 on im mune cells. Direct interference of this interaction with anti PD 1 monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and pem brolizumab, prevents the exhaustion of T cells and allows for an augmented antitumor response. This is evidenced by posttreatment biopsies where a dense accumulation of cytotoxic T cells is seen in responding tumor sites."
"A 65-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer comes  to your office with evidence of progressive disease while  on treatment with leuprolide and bicalutamide. Laborato - ry values and scans show a rising PSA and increased bone  metastases. His testosterone level is less than 50 ng/dL.  Despite these findings, he feels well. He denies any bone  pain, fatigue, or other symptoms related to his cancer. He  wishes to discuss further treatment options, in particular  immunotherapy options. He is aware of other non-im - munotherapy options, such as abiraterone and enzaluta - mide from past discussions. In your discussion with the  patient, you mention the impressive activity of anti-PD-1  and anti-PD-L1 therapies in a range of cancers, but not so  far in prostate cancer patients. The only approved immu - notherapy in prostate cancer is sipuleucel-T, which works  by a different mechanism of action. Which of the follow - ing is appropriate to tell the patient, based on available  information",A,"Overall survival, but not progression free survival, is pro longed with sipuleucel T. This is an autologous dendrit ic cell vaccine strategy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of castrate resistant Immunotherapy and Pathway Inhibitors 17 metastatic prostate cancer. It involves leukapheresis of a patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells and exposing them ex vivo to a recombinant prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) protein fused with GM CSF. This is designed to ac tive dendritic cell function. The activated cells are then in travenously administered back to the patient as a series of three treatments. The activated dendritic cells will then in duce T cell immunity against prostate cancer cells express ing PAP . After multiple phase III studies of sipuleucel T, improvement in overall survival, but not response rate or progression free survival, has been demonstrated."
"A 58-year-old female with a history of resected stage II mel - anoma at the left ankle presents to your office with multiple  dark subcentimeter nodules over the left shin. These appear  to be in the dermal layer and are nontender. The patient’s  exam shows no other disease. At the left groin, the surgi - cal scar from the sentinel lymph node biopsy is well healed,  and there is no palpable adenopathy. A biopsy of one of the  dermal nodules demonstrates metastatic melanoma. Stag - ing scans show no distant disease. The patient is active and  works full-time. She does not have any limitations or other  significant medical problems. Surgery is not practical given  the number and extent of disease. After a discussion of sys - temic therapy versus intralesional therapy, she is most in - terested in receiving talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC). You  explain this is an immunotherapy, but works by a different  mechanism of action than the anti-PD-1 therapies frequent - ly used in patients with advanced melanoma. What is most  appropriate to tell the patient",E,"Durable responses are seen in one third of stage III mela noma patients treated with TVEC, which is an oncolytic virus that is based on a modified herpes simplex virus type 1. Functional deletion of the neurovirulence factor gene (ICP34.5) limits its ability to cause a disseminated infection and promotes the tumor cell specific replication. It also has insertion of a gene encoding human GM CSF. When TVEC is injected directly into the tumor site, it lo cally replicates causing tumor cell death and induction of tumor specific T cell responses. Antitumor responses can occur both at the injected and the noninjected tumor sites. In the phase III melanoma study of intralesional TVEC versus subcutaneous GM CSF, the durable response rate was 16.3% versus 2.1%, respectively. However, in the sub group analysis, the durable response rate was much high er in stage III patients at 33%. Given the favorable toxicity profile and ability to monitor for delayed responses, offer ing TVEC to the patient in this question is a reasonable approach."
"A 40-year-old male with resected stage IIIB melanoma  is treated with adjuvant ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg every   4 weeks. Prior to the third dose of ipilimumab, he develops  watery bowel movements and abdominal cramping. He de - nies any history of sick contacts. There is no blood in the stool.  His usual pattern is one formed bowel movement per day.  The frequency escalates from three bowel movements in a   24-hour window to six bowel movements over 2 days. The  consistency is now more watery, and there has been no im - provement with loperamide. He comes to the clinic for eval - uation. His vital signs are stable, and he is afebrile. Bowel  sounds are more active than usual, but there is no abdominal  pain with palpation, distention, or other concerning signs.  Overall, he appears well despite the symptoms. A CT scan  of the abdomen and pelvis is performed and shows inflam - matory changes in the descending colon. Stool studies are  positive for leukocytes, but the Clostridium difﬁcile  (C. difﬁcile )   antigen is negative and cultures preliminarily are negative for  infectious source. Oral prednisone 1 mg/kg daily is started.  Two days later, his symptoms are worsened and he is admit - ted to the hospital. What are the next appropriate steps",B,"Switch to intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg q12 hours, test for latent tuberculosis and monitor. The patient in this question has initially developed grade 2 diarrhea/ colitis, which then progresses to a grade 3 level despite appropriate outpatient treatment with prednisone at 1 mg/ kg. Grade 3 diarrhea was reported in 10% of patients treated with ipilimumab on the EORTC 18071 trial. Infec tion and other causes of diarrhea need to be considered, but in a patient treated with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg, immune mediated diarrhea or enterocolitis is usually the most like ly diagnosis and requires prompt treatment. In patients not responding to oral prednisone as an outpatient, admission to the hospital for supportive care and intravenous corti costeroids is required. If there is no rapid improvement, administration of infliximab is indicated. Because of the potential risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis with inf liximab, ruling this out with assays, such as a commercially available interferon gamma release test, is a good consid eration prior to administration."
"In viral-associated malignancies, such as HPV-associated  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and  polyomavirus-associated Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC),  antitumor immune responses with dense T-cell infil - trate can be observed. T-cell-specific responses against  viral antigens that are present in tumor cells have been  identified. This suggests a particularly important role  that immunotherapies could play in viral-associated  malignancies. Anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies have now  been studied in nonselected patient populations with ad - vanced HNSCC and MCC. Which of the statements most  accurately represents the activity of anti-PD-1/PD-L1  therapies in viral associated malignancies compared to  their nonviral counterparts",C,"There is a trend of higher response rates in HPV associated HNSCC that is not seen in polyomavirus associated MCC. In studies of anti PD 1/PD L1 therapies in patients with advanced HNSCC and MCC, objective responses are seen in both viral positive and viral negative patients. The ab sence of the virus component does not limit the immune recognition and potential for immunotherapies in these disease types. Immune infiltrates are seen in both viral positive and viral negative tumors. However, the biology may be different. For example, in MCC, viral positive tu mors typically have a low mutational burden, whereas vi ral negative tumors have a high mutational burden similar to melanoma. In Keynote 012 and Checkmate 141 HNSCC studies with pembrolizumab and nivolumab, respectively, objective response rates and survival were higher in pa tients with HPV+ tumors. In the studies of pembrolizumab and avelumab (anti PD L1 antibody; pending Food and Drug Administration approval) in MCC, there were no clear associations or trends in polyomavirus status and re sponse."
"A 55-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC; clear  cell subtype) develops recurrence 2 years after nephrec - tomy for localized disease. Staging scans show numerous  pulmonary lesions with the largest measuring 2 cm in the  right lower lobe. A biopsy confirms the diagnosis. He is  not interested in targeted therapies, such as pazopanib and  sunitinib. He wishes to be treated upfront with immuno - therapy. He feels well overall with a good performance  status. In his past medical history, it is noted that he has  ischemic cardiomyopathy from a prior coronary artery  event. He has no active angina symptoms at present, but  finds he develops shortness of breath during moderate  exertion. His last recorded ejection fraction was 40%–50%.  Which immune therapy agent would you recommend",C,"Clinical trial with anti PD 1 therapy. Currently anti PD 1 therapy is approved only as a second line therapy in patients with metastatic RCC. In the phase III study of nivolumab versus everolimus in patients progressing after initial treatment with a vascular endothelial growth fac tor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nivolumab was superior with an objective response rate of 25%. Long term follow up of the phase I study of nivolumab in RCC patients showed a 5 year overall survival rate of 34%. IL 2 is another frontline immunotherapy to consider in appropriately selected pa tients based on its potential for cure but also its toxicities. In particular, patients can undergo a significant cardiovas cular leak syndrome leading to hemodynamic instability. IL 2 would not be a good choice in a patient with coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy."

The recommended dose of lenalidomide is 10 mg daily 21/28 days or 28 days monthly. Because the EPO level is greater than 500, the chances of responding to epoetin are low. If the patient fails to respond to lenalido mide, certainly a clinical trial should be considered. Blood transfusion alone is only supportive care and would not control the underlying myelodysplasia."

In the AZA 001 study that com pared azacitidine versus conventional care treatment in high risk MDS, azacitidine improved overall survival with a higher hematological response compared to convention al care. Lenalidomide is a not an appropriate option in this patient with complex cytogenetics and trilineage dyspla sia.

What is next appropriate step in the  management of this patient,C,"This is an elderly patient with high risk therapy related MDS. All cell lines are affected. Azacitidine remains a treatment of choice in this case. In the AZA 001 study in patients with high risk MDS, azacitidine increased over all survival and hematological response rate compared to conventional care. Hematopoietic stem cell transplan tation would have been a valid option if the patient was younger and with fewer comorbidities."
"Iron studies are within normal limits.  EPO is 605 mU/L. Direct Coomb test is negative. Stool for  guaiac is negative.

She was started on decitabine and has received  four cycles so far without any improvement in her counts.  She remains pancytopenic and now requires packed red  cells and platelet transfusion once every 4–6 weeks. Repeat  bm biopsy shows persistent MDS with 4% blasts and dip - loid karyotype. What is the most appropriate next step,E,"This patient is failing therapy with a hypomethylating agent and now has increasing transfusion requirements. Switching to another hypomethylating agent is of no ben efit. The best option for this patient is to proceed to hemat opoietic stem cell transplant. Because it can take weeks to identify a donor, it would appropriate to enroll this patient in a suitable clinical trial and proceed to stem cell trans plant once a donor is available."
"A 65-year-old female presented with a 2-month history  of fatigue and easy bruising. She was noted to be pancy - topenic. This led to a bm biopsy that demonstrated 65%  cellularity with multilineage dysplasia and 13% blasts.  Karyotype showed −7, +8, +11 in 20/20 metaphases. What  mutation, if found, would affect the response to hypo - methylating agents",A,DNA methylation is a prognostic marker and predictor of response to therapy among patients with MDS and ap pears to be a mechanism of disease progression to AML. Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome 21 TET2 belongs to a family of genes that play a role in the epigenetic control of DNA expression through demethyla tion. Mutations in TET2 are therefore more responsive to therapy with hypomethylating agents.
"A 25-year-old male is noted to have macrocytic anemia on  a routine blood test done as part of college sports physical.  He recalls being told he was anemic 5 years ago when he was trying to donate blood as part of his school’s health  fair. He did not follow up with his PCP at that time because  he felt great and had no symptoms. On exam he is noted  to be short statured but without any other abnormality.  He has no rash and leukoplakia. His finger- and toenails  appear normal. He has no family history of anemia, and  both his parents and siblings are in good health. Workup  including iron studies, B12, folate, TSH, and retic count are  all within normal limits. His bone marrow exam, however,  shows dysplasia with monosomy 7 consistent with a di - agnosis of MDS. Besides referring him for hematopoietic  stem cell transplant, what is the most appropriate next step  in the evaluation of this patient",D,"This patient likely has Fanconi anemia. Chromosome breakage analysis testing should be arranged in this pa tient to confirm the diagnosis. Once confirmed, the patient should proceed with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Telomerase length analysis is done in patients where dys keratosis congentia (DKC) is suspected. DKC patients usu ally present with a rash, and nail changes are common. Red blood cell adenosine deaminase level is elevated in pa tients with Diamond Blackfan anemia, which is usually di agnosed in the first few years of life. Mutations in GATA2 and RUNX1 are familial disorders with a strong family his tory, which this patient does not have. RUNX1 mutation is associated with familial thrombocytopenia, whereas muta tion in GATA2 mostly involves decreased monocytes and increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infections."

However, she has  been noted to have a steady decline in her platelet count  over the past 6 months that has been ranging between  60 and 70 K for the last 2 months. White cell count and  hemoglobin are normal. B12, folate, and TSH are also  within normal limits. HIV and hepatitis profile are nega - tive. A bone marrow biopsy was done that shows a mild - ly hypocellular marrow with no conclusive evidence  of dysplasia or melanoma. Karyotype is of a normal   female. FISH and flow cytometry for MDS are unremark - able. Molecular mutation panel shows RUNX1 mutation.  What is the next best step in this patient’s management",B,More than 30% of patients with unexplained cytopenias who do not meet diagnostic criteria for MDS carry MDS associated somatic mutations. These mutations are indica tive of clonal hematopoiesis. Such cases are referred to as clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS). The natural history of such patients is largely unknown. It is recommended that blood counts be closely monitored in such patients.
"His renal and liver functions are within normal  limits. With the elevated ferritin level, the patient is at high  risk for developing cardiac, liver, and pancreatic dysfunc - tion. What step should be taken to reduce the risk of iron  overload",C,"Iron overload is associated with organ toxicity. Measures should be taken to reduce iron in patients with iron over load to reduce iron associated organ damage. There are cur rently three iron chelators that are approved in the United States: deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone. Patients are recommended to undergo ocular and auditory exams as well as renal and liver function testing prior to starting therapy. Deferiprone is also associated with agranulocyto sis. Increasing the dose of epoetin or adding G CSF may improve the anemia but not help the iron overload. The pa tient is anemic and phlebotomy will worsen the anemia."

What should be the next  step in the management of this patient",E,"The patient has high risk MDS given elevated bm blasts, complex karyotype, and all three cell lines affected. This patient should proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplant because he already has a matched sibling donor available. Otherwise, starting azacitidine followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant when a donor is available is the ap propriate treatment."
"She has mild leukopenia and normal  platelets. Her peripheral blood smear is reviewed by the  hematopathologist who reports dysplasia and recom - mends a bone marrow exam. Stool exam is negative for  occult blood. Other than MDS, what can be causing dys - plasia in this patient",C,"It is important to distinguish between MDS and other conditions that can mimic MDS. Copper deficiency occurs often in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. Along with B12 deficiency and zinc excess, copper defi ciency should be ruled out as a cause of anemia especially in patients having undergone bariatric surgery. Erythroid hyperplasia with decreased myeloid to erythroid ratio and dyserythropoiesis including megaloblastic changes may be seen in the bm exam, which can be mistaken for MDS."
"A 65-year-old female presented with a 2-month history  of fatigue and easy bruising. She was noted to be pancy - topenic. This led to a bm biopsy that demonstrated 65%  cellularity with multilineage dysplasia and 13% blasts.  Karyotype showed −7, −5, +11, +8 in 20/20 metaphases.  What mutation is likely to be found in this patient",E,The TP53 gene is located on chromosome 17p. It is a tu mor suppressor gene and plays a vital role in cell cycle ar rest. Mutations in TP53 are commonly seen in MDS with complex cytogenetics (up to 50%) and with 5q (15%–20%). TP53 mutation confers a poor prognosis independent of the IPSS in MDS.
"1). The patient was noted to be  pancytopenic on a routine blood test 2 weeks ago. Work- up shows high-risk MDS with complex cytogenetics and  TP53 mutation. He remains blood and platelet transfusion  dependent. He has three younger siblings aged 75, 72, and  68 years of age who are in good health and would like to  be tested as a potential match for a stem cell transplant.  What should be next step in treating this patient",B,"This patient has high risk MDS. Allogeneic stem cell trans plant is recommended in patients with high risk MDS and offers a chance to cure the disease. However, given this patient’s age and comorbidities, the risks involved in un dergoing a transplant outweigh the benefits. This patient should be treated with decitabine. In a phase 3 trial, decit abine was compared to the best supportive care in patients with high risk MDS not suitable for stem cell transplant. Decitabine was found to be associated with a higher pro gression free survival and a lower risk of progression to AML in 1 year. However, there was no difference in overall survival noted. Lenalidomide is not an appropriate choice for patients with high risk MDS. REFERENCE Question 10"
0%. A bone marrow exam shows CML  chronic phase with t(9;22). What is the most likely aberrant  fusion protein,A,"P210 is the most common fusion protein found in patients with CML chronic phase produced due to a breakpoint in exon 13 or exon 14 (also called exon b2 and b3) in the BCR gene that is fused to the ABL1 gene on exon a2. P190 is more commonly found in Philadelphia positive ALL, whereas P230 is a larger fusion protein that occurs less commonly in CML (<1%). PML/RARA is found in acute promyelocytic leukemia and not CML."
5%. What is the  next appropriate step,E,"There is no indication to switch therapy at this point as the PCR is less than 10%. In the DASISION and ENESTnd trials with dasatinib and nilotinib, respectively, patients achieving less than 10% BCR/ABL at 3 months were as sociated with a superior PFS and OS. The most important time point is 6 months into therapy, when a PCR for BCR/ ABL of greater than 10%, which corresponds to less than a partial cytogenetic response, is considered a failure of therapy . Achievement of a major cytogenetic response (Ph+ metaphases <35%) at 6 months is associated with a superior PFS and OS."
"The spleen is palpable 6 cm  below the left costal margin. The patient is started on   hydroxyurea. A bone marrow biopsy is done that shows  hypercellular marrow with 5% blasts, and FISH is positive  for BCR/ABL. What is the most likely diagnosis",C,"This is the accelerated phase of CML based on the periph eral blood basophilia of greater than 20%. The WHO cri teria defining the accelerated phase of CML includes the presence of one or more of the following features:  10%–19% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow  Peripheral blood basophils greater than 20%  Platelets less than 100,000/ μL, unrelated to therapy  Platelets greater than 1,000,000/ μL, unresponsive to therapy  Progressive splenomegaly and increasing white cell count, unresponsive to therapy  Cytogenetic evolution (defined as the development of chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Philadel phia chromosome)"
A 58-year-old male diagnosed with chronic myeloid leu - kemia 5 years ago has failed treatment with imatinib and  dasatinib. His most recent bone marrow exam shows per - sistent chronic myeloid leukemia with t(9;22) in 15/20  metaphases. An ABL mutation analysis shows T315I. What  should be next TKI of choice,A,"Ponatinib is the only available tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against the gatekeeper T315I mutation. In the phase II PACE trial of ponatinib, 70% of the patients with CML chronic phase with T315I mutation achieved a major cytogenetic response."
"A 58-year-old male diagnosed with chronic myeloid leu - kemia 7 years ago has failed treatment with imatinib,  dasatinib, and nilotinib. His most recent bone marrow  exam shows persistent chronic myeloid leukemia with  t(9;22) in 15/20 metaphases. No ABL mutations are de - tected. What is the best next step in the management of  this patient",E,"In this case, the patient has failed to respond to three dif ferent TKIs. The chances of responding to a fourth TKI is much less, and hence the patient should be referred to stem cell transplant if eligible."
EPO level is low. Peripheral blood shows a mutation  in JAK2V617F. What is next step in the management of this  patient,D,This patient has clinical features consistent with PV including generalized pruritus and enlarged spleen. JAK2V617F positivity further confirms the diagnosis of PV . One of the main goals of treatment is to reduce the risk of thrombosis in these patients. Low dose aspirin and phlebotomy (aiming at hematocrit <45) reduces this risk. Addition of hydroxyurea is indicated in patients who are at high risk of thrombosis (older than 60 years and prior thrombosis).
Peripheral blood testing shows a JAK2V617F mutation.  Lower extremity Doppler studies show a left lower ex - tremity deep vein thrombosis. Patient is started on anti - coagulation with lovenox. What is the next step in man - aging this patient,B,"This patient has clinical features consistent with PV in cluding generalized pruritus, erythromelalgia, and en larged spleen. JAK2V617F positivity further confirms the diagnosis of PV . One of the main goals of treatment is to reduce the risk of thrombosis in these patients. Low dose aspirin and phlebotomy (aiming at hematocrit <45) reduces this risk. Addition of hydroxyurea is indicated in patients who are at high risk of thrombosis (older than 60 years and prior thrombosis). Addition of hydroxyurea is therefore warranted in this patient due to deep vein thrombosis."
The WBC and Hb are within normal limits. The  patient denies any excessive bleeding or any chronic infec - tion. He has no history of blood clots. The iron studies are  also within normal limits. Test for BCR/ABL from peripheral  blood is negative. The presence of which of the following is  associated with a lower risk of thrombosis in this patient,C,"This patient has findings consistent with ET. The presence of CALR mutation in ET is more commonly associated with male sex, lower WBC count and Hb levels, higher platelet count, and lower risk of thrombosis. There is, how ever, no clear difference in overall survival or transforma tion to myelofibrosis in these patients."
"WBC and Hb are normal. Stool for occult  blood is negative, and iron studies are within normal  limits. There is no history of chronic infection or blood  clots. He tests positive for JAK2V617F and negative for  BCR/ABL. What is the next best step in the management  of this patient",A,This patient has essential thrombocythemia. Patients younger than 60 years of age and with no prior thrombo sis should be maintained on low dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis.
Further workup showed positive  JAK2V617F. What is the next appropriate step,C,"This patient has essential thrombocythemia given elevated platelets with positive JAK2V617F. The patient should be started on low dose aspirin and hydroxyurea to prevent thrombosis. However, because the platelets are greater than 1 million, this puts the patient at risk for acquired von Willebrand disease due to abnormal adsorption of large von Willebrand factor multimers. This increases the risk of bleeding with aspirin. Low dose aspirin is acceptable if the ristocetin cofactor level is greater than 30%."
What is the next best approach,C,"This patient has likely transformed to myelofibrosis from underlying ET. Presence of constitutional symptoms with worsening anemia, peripheral blood blasts, enlarged spleen, fibrotic marrow with complex cytogenetics, and ASXL1 mutation all indicate transformation. Ruxolitinib is a valid option in this patient given constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly. However, he needs a transplant referral due to his high risk disease and possibility of transforma tion to acute leukemia. At present, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation constitutes the only treatment modality with a curative potential in myelofibrosis."
"A 67-year-old female is diagnosed with primary my - elofibrosis after she presented with a 1-month history of  worsening fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, and left upper  quadrant fullness. She was noted to be anemic and had  1% circulating blasts. Spleen is palpable 10 cm below the  left costal margin. A bone marrow exam shows a fibrotic  marrow with a complex karyotype. Workup is negative for  JAK2V617F, MPL, and CALR. Prognosis of this patient is  expected to be poor mainly due to",C,"Patients with primary myelofibrosis with triple negative disease (without JAK2, MPL, or CALR mutations) have a poor outcome. Tefferi et al. demonstrated an inferior leukemia free survival in patients with triple negative myelofibrosis. Myeloproliferative Disorders 25"
Further testing of peripheral blood shows  FIP1L1-PDGFRA by FISH. What is the next step in this  patient’s management,A,FIP1L1 PDFRA is very sensitive to imatinib. Initial imatin ib dose of 100 mg daily has shown to be effective in inducing rapid and durable responses in patients with PDGFRA associated hypereosinophilic syndromes.
"A 35-year-old male presents with a 4-month history  of pruritic rash that comes and goes. The rash mainly  involves his upper back. He also reports shortness of  breath with wheezing and diarrhea when the rash ap - pears. The rash improves with antihistamines. The pa - tient is concerned that he is developing new allergies  despite not being exposed to new detergents, creams,  lotions, or soaps. He has cut back on dairy products but  with no improvement in diarrhea when it occurs. Work- up shows elevated serum tryptase levels. A bone mar - row exam is expected to show which of the following by  flow cytometry:  ",B,"This is a case of mastocytosis. A typical immunophenotype in mastocytosis is CD117+, CD25+ and CD2 is +/−. Op tions C and D are consistent with acute myeloid leukemia. Option E is consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia."
"Peripheral blood differential shows marked  neutrophilia without any circulating blasts or basophilia.  On examination, the spleen is palpable 6 cm below the left  costal margin and the liver edge is also palpable. A bone  marrow biopsy demonstrates increased myeloid precur - sors with 3% blasts. There is no evidence of dysplasia. Cy - togenetics are negative for t(9;22). What is the most likely  mutation to be found in this case",B,This is a case of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) in which the patient demonstrates an elevated white cell count with mature granulocytic proliferation. The disease involves infiltration of these mature granulocytes into the organs causing enlargement of the spleen and liver. Muta tions in CSF 3R have been noted to play a central role in the pathogenesis of patients with CNL.
5%. What is the next step in the management of this  patient,D,"Patient has a rise in the PCR level for BCR/ABL. He should therefore be monitored closely, and a bone mar row exam should be done to confirm cytogenetic relapse. Loss of cytogenetic response or hematologic response are the two major indicators of switching therapy in patients with CML. Mutational analyses should be done prior to switching therapy in such patients. Increasing the dose of imatinib would result in more toxicity."
"The differential  shows 80% lymphocytes. Exam is unremarkable for palpa - ble lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. She denies  any fatigue, weight loss, fever, or drenching night sweats.  What is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of  this patient",C,"Per the WHO and IWCLL, the diagnosis of CLL requires the presence of at least 5 × 109 B lymphocytes/L (5000/ µL) in the peripheral blood. The clonality of the circulating B lymphocytes needs to be confirmed by flow cytometry. CLL cells co express the T cell antigen CD5 and B cell sur face antigens CD19, CD20, and CD"
"A 70-year-old male is referred to an oncologist after leu - kocytosis is noted on preoperative workup for right knee  replacement. Repeat blood work shows WBC count = 48  K/mm3, with 70% lymphocytes. Hemoglobin and platelets  are normal. There is no lymphadenopathy or splenomeg - aly on examination. Patient denies fatigue, fever, weight  loss, or night sweats. Peripheral blood is sent for flow cy - tometry, which is consistent with chronic lymphocytic leu - kemia. What profile fits the diagnosis",A,"The typical CLL immunophenotype demonstrates CD5+, CD20+ (dim), CD23+. CyclinD1 is, however, negative. CLL needs to be differentiated from mantle cell lymphoma that is also CD5+, but typically CD23 and cyclinD1 is + (choice B). Choice C is consistent with Waldenstrom mac roglobulinemia with positive surface immunoglobulin for IgM. Choice D is consistent with acute myeloid leukemia, whereas choice is E is hairy cell leukemia."
He has palpable cervical lymphadenopathy up to  2 cm in size. Spleen is palpable 7 cm below the left costal  margin. What is the next step in the management of this  patient,A,"This patient with CLL meets the criteria to receive treatment including constitutional symptoms and significant spleno megaly. The presence of 11q on FISH testing and presence of unmutated IgHV indicate poor prognosis in this patient. Treatment with chemoimmunotherapy in patients with 11q is associated with higher response rate, survival rate, and relapse free survival. Hence, younger patients who are able to tolerate chemoimmunotherapy should receive the FCR regimen. From the CLL 10 study, FCR is superior to bendamustine and rituximab (BR) regimen in younger patients. In those younger than 65 years, both FCR and BR have similar outcomes, but BR is less toxic. Options D and E are appropriate in the relapse/refractory setting."
"A 58-year-old male with newly diagnosed CLL presents to  your office for a second opinion. He was diagnosed with  CLL 3 months ago after an elevated white count of 33 K/ mm3 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 26 K/mm3  were noted. Hemoglobin and platelet count are normal.  There is no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly on exam.  He denies any constitutional symptoms. CLL fluorescent  in situ hybridization panel shows del17p as the sole ab - normality. IgHV is unmutated, and Zap-70 and CD38 are  negative. What is the next step in the management of this  patient",C,It is important to recognize the indications/criteria for treating CLL patients. Not all patients with CLL need to be treated. The IWCLL defines “active disease” by the presence of one or more of the following criteria:
What is the next appropriate step,E,"Up to one third of the patients with CLL can develop auto immune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) that is unrelated to the type of treatment. These patients are treated in the same manner as other patients with AIHA. Glucocorticoids are the initial treatment of choice. In this scenario, elevated retic count and LDH and DAT + are markers of hemolysis. The remaining choices are appropriate if anemia is a result of disease progression or refractory cases of AIHA."
"A 78-year-old female with TP53 mutated CLL diagnosed 1  year ago was treated with ibrutinib for 9 months. Patient  unfortunately progressed with worsening lymphadenopa - thy. She has now been on idelalisib and rituximab for 2  months. She presents to the ER with 1-day history of wors - ening shortness of breath, dry cough, and fever. On pres - entation, she is noted to be hypoxic. CXR shows bilateral  fluffy infiltrates. What is the most likely causative agent",C,"One should recognize the side effects and toxicity of differ ent treatment modalities. Idelalisib is associated with in creased risk of Pneumocystis jiroveci and cytomegalovirus infection. Patients are recommended to remain on pneu mocystis prophylaxis throughout treatment with idelal isib. If infection is confirmed, the drug should be perma nently discontinued."
What is the next step in managing this pa - tient,C,"The patient meets the criteria to initiate treatment. Given multiple comorbidities, the patient is less likely to tolerate purine analogs. In this case, obinutuzumab with chloram bucil and ibrutinib are category 1 choices for treatment. However, ibrutinib is associated with increased bleeding Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Hairy Cell Leukemia, and Other Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorders 29 risk. The patient in this scenario has a history of recurrent bleeding peptic ulcer disease. Ibrutinib is therefore not a good option in this case. The patient should therefore be treated with chlorambucil with obinutuzumab. Both ofa tumumab and rituximab can be used in combination with chlorambucil in older patients with CLL in the front line setting."
"What translocation, if present  on FISH testing, would help differentiate CLL from mantle  cell lymphoma",B,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in its rare leukemic form shares some of the immunophenotypic features with CLL. Like CLL, MCL is CD5+, CD19+ and CD20+, but negative for CD23. Unlike CLL, MCL is positive for t(11;14), which helps distinguish between the two entities. Choice A is commonly seen in follicular lymphoma, whereas choices D and E are seen in marginal zone lymphoma. Choice C is seen in Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma."
"This is her third episode  of pneumonia in the last 6 months. On her last episode, the  nasal wash was positive for parainfluenza virus. What is  the most appropriate next step in the management of this  patient",B,"Recurrent infections are commonly seen in CLL due to hypogammaglobulinemia. This patient has recurrent pneumonia with low levels of serum IgG. Besides cover age with broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient should receive immunoglobulin replacement. Prophylactic use of immunoglobulin remains controversial. IV ganciclovir and foscarnet are used in patients with confirmed CMV infection, but has yet to be proved in this case. Treating the patient with ibrutinib will not necessarily help boost the immune system to help fight infection."
"1%, LDH and haptoglobin are normal. Liver and  kidney function, B12, folate, and TSH are all within nor - mal limits. Serum iron level and saturation are elevated.  Direct Coomb test is negative. Stool for occult blood is  negative. What should be the next step in the manage - ment of this patient",D,"Patients with CLL are at increased risk for developing pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), most likely considered to be im mune mediated. This is the most likely diagnosis in this patient, who presents with severe anemia without any evi dence of bleed or nutritional deficiencies. A bone marrow is warranted to rule out anemia from disease progression versus PRCA. Viral studies, however, should also be done in patients with PRCA because viruses are known to be as sociated with this condition. Prednisone and rituximab are more commonly used in treating AIHA."
"3,  and platelets = 35 K. Iron studies, B12, folate, TSH, and se - rum protein electrophoresis are within normal limits. Hep - atitis panel and HIV testing are negative. Peripheral blood  shows mature lymphocytes with hair-like projections. A  bone marrow biopsy is done. Which option reflects the  most likely flow cytometry results",C,"This patient has features of hairy cell leukemia including pancytopenia, enlarged spleen, and a peripheral smear showing cells with hairy projections. Choice C is the cor rect answer. The mucosal lymphocyte antigen, CD103, is a sensitive marker for HCL. CD103 is a member of the integrin family and is also present on mucosa associated T cells and some activated lymphocytes. The presence of CD103, when co expressed with other pan B cell markers, is highly suggestive of HCL."
"5,  and platelets = 45 K. Iron studies, B12, folate, TSH, and  serum protein electrophoresis are within normal limits.  Hepatitis panel and HIV testing are negative. Peripheral  blood shows mature lymphocytes with hair-like projec - tions. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity is posi - tive. A bone marrow biopsy is done. Which mutation is  most likely to be found",B,"The correct answer is BRAF V600E. Most patients with hairy cell leukemia harbor mutation in the BRAF gene. The remaining choices are more commonly seen in MDS, AML, and myelofibrosis."
"On examination, the spleen is palpable 5 cm   below the left costal margin. A bone biopsy demonstrates  hairy cell leukemia. BRAF V600E is positive. What is the  next step in the management of the patient",A,"Cladribine, as a single agent, has been shown to achieve a complete remission rate of 80%–98%. Long term follow up of patients treated with cladribine has shown disease free survival of more than 8 years and a 12 year overall surviv al rate of 80%–90%. Rituximab, used mainly in the relapse setting, is associated with modest activity."
"8, and platelets = 80K. LDH is normal. CT  of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows multicom - partment lymphadenopathy, with the largest lymph node  measuring 5 cm in the anterior cervical chain. The patient  has now been started on venetoclax. For which of the fol - lowing is the patient at risk",B,"One should recognize the toxicity that is associated with each treatment modality. Venetoclax, a BCL 2 inhibitor, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/ refractory CLL with 17p deletion after failing at least one prior therapy. Venetoclax can lead to a rapid decline in the tumor burden in the first 5 weeks of dose escalation. This increases the risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Patients should be vigilantly watched for possible tumor lysis. Venetoclax may need to be put on hold if there is evidence of tumor lysis."
"The patient reports ongoing fatigue and  weight loss. Peripheral blood shows cell lymphocytes with  abundant cytoplasmic granules. Peripheral blood flow cy - tometry shows CD3+, CD8+, CD56-, CD57+, TCR α/β+.  What is the most likely diagnosis",D,"This is most consistent with a diagnosis of T cell large gran ular lymphocytic leukemia (T LGL). It is very commonly associated with autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren syndrome. It is most commonly asso ciated with rheumatoid arthritis in up to 25% of the cases of T LGL. It is characterized by organ infiltration by the LGL cells causing splenomegaly and cytopenias. The most common immunophenotypes associated with this disor der in up to 85% of the cases include CD3+, CD56−, and CD57+."
"A 22-year-old college student presents with unexplained  15-pound weight loss, drenching night sweats, and diffuse  pruritus without a rash. On physical exam, she appears tired  but otherwise well. She has no peripheral lymphadenopathy  or splenomegaly. Chest radiograph reveals a large mediasti - nal mass. Computerized tomography scans of the chest, ab - domen, and pelvis show a 13-cm anterior mediastinal mass  without lymphadenopathy in the neck, axilla, or below the  diaphragm. What is the next step in her diagnostic evaluation",C,"A surgical biopsy is critical to establish the diagnosis of HL. Given that the RS cells constitute approximately 1% of the cells in an involved lymph node, a specimen derived from a needle biopsy may not include the diagnostic cells and lacks the architecture necessary to subclassify the lymphoma. A PET scan is required as part of the staging evaluation, but it is not necessary to identifying a site to biopsy given the appearance of her CT scans. Bone marrow biopsy is not required given the sensitivity of PET to identifying bone marrow or bony sites of disease. An echocardiogram is typically obtained prior to the administration of anthracycline containing therapy but is not helpful in establishing the diagnosis."
What is the diagnosis,C,"The diagnosis is NLPHL. Patients typically present with asymptomatic lymphadenopathy that frequently spares the mediastinum. The RS cells, referred to as “popcorn cells” or lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells, express CD20 and are typically negative for CD15 and CD30, which are typically found on the RS cells of classical HL. Gray zone lymphoma shares features of classical HL and primary me diastinal large B cell lymphoma."
"A 50-year-old male with human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) on antiretrovirals with a CD4 count of 500/mm3 and  undetectable viral load presents with fevers, drenching  night sweats, and 20-pound weight loss. The positron emis - sion tomography scan reveals fluorodeoxyglucose avid  lymphadenopathy above and below the diaphragm with  multiple sites of bony involvement. Biopsy of a right neck  node reveals mixed cellularity, HL. He has stage IVB dis - ease with four risk factors on the International Prognostic  Scale (age >45, male gender, stage IV disease, and lympho - penia). Pretreatment echocardiogram and pulmonary func - tion tests are normal. How would you treat this patient",A,"Patients with HIV are at increased risk for the development of HL and frequently develop an advanced stage disease that is associated with Epstein Barr virus. ABVD is the standard of care in patients with HIV associated HL, and outcomes in patient on antiretrovirals are similar to HIV negative patients. This patient has no contraindication to the inclusion of bleomycin, but the patient requires careful monitoring for the development of respiratory symptoms. Although escalated BEACOPP is associated with improved progression free survival compared to ABVD without overall survival benefit, it is associated with significantly higher myelosuppression and risk of infection. Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30 directed antibody drug conjugate approved for use in the relapsed setting but not for upfront use. Nivolumab, an antibody against PD 1 (programmed cell death protein 1), is currently being studied in relapsed/refractory HL.Hodgkin Lymphoma 32"
A 19-year-old male is diagnosed with stage IA NLPHL in - volving the left neck. Which of the following is an appropri - ate therapeutic strategy,D,"Long term follow up of patients treated with IFRT shows that approximately 90% of patients with stage I disease have long term disease free survival. The addition of chemothera py does not improve outcomes, and there are no data to sup port the use of chemotherapy alone in patients with stage I NLPHL. Mantle radiation is not associated with improved disease control and has a high risk of late cardiovascular dis ease and increased risk of second malignancies. Although rituximab has high response rates in NLPHL, the durability is inferior compared to radiotherapy in stage I patients."
"An 18-year-old woman presents with persistent cough and  chest pain with alcohol consumption but denies any fevers,  night sweats, or weight loss. Chest radiograph and subse - quent computed tomography (CT) images demonstrate a  10-cm mediastinal mass. Surgical biopsy reveals nodular  sclerosis subtype of classical HL. Which of the following is  correct:  ",D,"The malignant cell in HL is the RS cell is a multinucleated cell derived from a germinal center B cell in the vast major ity of cases. RS cells comprise approximately 1% of the cells in the involved site and are surrounded by mixed inflam matory cells. The RS cells in classical HL typically express CD30 and CD15. PAX 5 expression is weak. Genetic analy sis of RS cells shows near uniform amplification of 9p24.1, leading to the expression of PDL 1 and PDL 2 (programmed cell death ligands 1 and 2). PD 1 (programmed cell death 1) is expressed on a subset of surrounding immune cells."
"A 35-year-old woman presents with neck fullness without  fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. On physical examina - tion, she has enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical and su - praclavicular regions bilaterally. Left axillary lymph node  biopsy indicates classical HL, nodular sclerosis subtype.  Positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET-CT) images demonstrate fluorodeoxyglucose avid  lymphadenopathy on both sides of the neck and the me - diastinum. Which of the following baseline studies is re - quired as part of her pretreatment prognostic evaluation",A,"The ESR is an important component of risk stratification for patients with early stage HL. Both the German Hodgkin Study Group and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification identify an ESR ≥50 mm/h without symptoms or ≥30 mm/h with B symptoms as an ad verse prognostic indicator. The serum lactate dehydrogenase level is typically normal in early stage HL (although it may be elevated in patients with bulky mediastinal disease) and is not prognostic in early stage HL. Patients without underly ing pulmonary disease are unlikely to have abnormal baseline pulmonary function testing, and this does not necessarily pre dict the development of bleomycin related pulmonary toxic ity. Patients presenting with stage I/II classical HL without B symptoms have a low risk of bone marrow involvement, and PET scan has a higher sensitivity for detecting occult marrow involvement than bone marrow biopsy."
"A 26-year-old female with stage IIA NS HL is treated with  6 cycles of ABVD and achieves a PET-CT at the end of ther - apy. After 2 years, she develops recurrent neck lymphad - enopathy. Biopsy reveals nodular sclerosis HL. What is the  next step in her management",D,"More than half of patients who develop recurrent HL that remains sensitive to chemotherapy have long term disease control with autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients are treated with second line chemotherapy, with regimens such as ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. Respond ing patients then undergo stem cell collection followed by high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell trans plants. No comparative data exist to evaluate the possibil ity of curative therapy with radiation alone in the relapsed setting. Given the patient has recurred following prior ABVD chemotherapy, an alternative second line regimen is used. Although gemcitabine is an active drug, combination therapy is associated with higher overall and complete re mission rates."
A 36-year-old male treated with involved-field radiation  therapy (IFRT) to the right neck for stage IA lymphocyte  predominate Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) presents with  fatigue and night sweats. The PET scan reveals FDG avid  lymphadenopathy in the abdomen with multiple lesions in  the liver and spleen. What is the most likely diagnosis,B,"Nodular lymphocyte predominate HL is associated with a risk of transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma of approximately 10%, and patients typically present with abdominal disease, often involving the spleen. B symptoms are more likely seen in patients with aggressive lymphoma than NLPHL. Although radiotherapy is associated with a risk of secondary malignancies, the patient received treat ment only to the neck. The pattern of disease involvement is atypical for HL or sarcoid."
"A 20-year-old woman presents with persistent cough  without fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. On physical  examination, her vital signs are normal. Physical exam is  notable for 2–3 cm nodes in the bilateral neck. Excisional  lymph node biopsy reveals classical HL, nodular sclerosis.  The positron emission tomography images show multiple  fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes in the bilateral cer - vical/supraclavicular regions and a 5 cm mediastinal mass.  Laboratory values are notable for a normal CBC and ESR  of 40 mm/h. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy with ABVD,  all the nodes have normalized in size and the uptake in all  sites is less than mediastinal blood pool (Deauville criteria  2). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step",C,"Per the HD6 Canadian/US Intergroup study, patients with early stage disease were randomly assigned to ABVD chemotherapy alone or to subtotal radiation to the nodes alone or with 2 cycles of ABVD for favorable and unfavorable risk disease, respectively. Patients in the chemotherapy only group who had a complete response (according to CT images) after 2 cycles of ABVD received a total of 4 cycles of chemotherapy. The remainder of patients received 6 cycles. At 12 years, the overall survival was superior for patients who only received chemotherapy. Patients who achieved a CR after 4 cycles of ABVD had a 92% freedom from disease progression at 12 years. The patient in this clinical scenario has stage IIA disease with three sites of involvement (bilateral cervical/supraclavicular, and mediastinum). She therefore has unfavorable disease according to the German Hodgkin Study Group and does not fit criteria for the HD10 study with 2 cycles of ABVD plus 20 Gy of IFRT. Given the patient is younger than 30 years, she is at high risk for the subsequent development of radiation induced breast cancer, with the disease involvement in the mediastinum and axilla."
"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded  RNA (EBER) signal is positive. Staging shows nonbulky  disease isolated to the left neck. Laboratory studies are no - table for an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 5 mm/h (reference range, 0–20 mm/h). Which of the following is  the most appropriate treatment strategy",A,"This patient has stage IIA favorable disease with two sites of disease involvement without any other risk factors, (bulky disease, B symptoms, an ESR ≥50 mm/h, or extranodal dis ease). In the HD10 trial, patients were randomized in a fac torial design to four versus 2 cycles of ABVD chemotherapy and 30 Gy versus 20 Gy of IRFT. There was no difference in freedom from treatment failure in any of the treatment arms, and 2 cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy of radiotherapy was associated with less toxicity. In the HD13 GHSG trial, patients were assigned to one of four chemotherapy regimens (ABVD, AVD, ABV , and AV) followed by 30 Gy of IFRT. The omission of dacarbazine and bleomycin was associated with inferior rates of freedom from treatment failure. Escalated bleomy cin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPPesc) has not been studied in early, favorable disease, and it is not recommended for patients over 60 given its toxicity. Brentuximab vedotin is approved for relapsed HL."
"A 30-year-old woman presents to establish ongoing  care. She feels well and enjoys long-distance running. 10  years earlier she was treated with 4 cycles of ABVD plus  involved-field radiation therapy for stage IIA classical  Hodgkin lymphoma involving the left neck, left axilla, and  mediastinum. She is feeling well and has not seen a physi - cian for 7 years. What do you recommend for the patient",B,"Patients under the age of 30 treated with radiotherapy to the chest are at a significantly increased risk of breast cancer. Patients should initiate screening 8 years after radiation or at the age of 40, whichever occurs first. Given the patient is asymptomatic and 10 years out from therapy, the likelihood of disease recurrence is extremely low and there is no role for surveillance imaging or an ESR. She has no cardiac or res piratory symptoms, and pulmonary function testing or stress echocardiogram is not routinely recommended."
"2 g/dL), anemia  (hemoglobin of 10 g/dL), and lymphopenia (absolute lym - phocyte count of 500/mm3). Her oncologist recommends  therapy with ABVD. ABVD is associated with all the fol - lowing toxicities except:  ",E,"ABVD is not associated with an increased risk of infertility. Adriamycin can rarely cause cardiac dysfunction. The risk is dose related, and patients receiving 6 cycles of ABVD receive a cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2, which is below 450 mg/m2, above which the incidence of cardiomyopathy rises significantly. Bleomycin is associated with pulmo nary toxicity, and patients must be followed carefully for the development of cough, dyspnea, or crackles on chest exam. Neutropenia occurs commonly in patients receiving ABVD, although the risk of febrile neutropenia is very low and most patients do not require white blood cell growth factors. Vinblastine commonly causes peripheral neuropa thy and constipation that can be severe and result in ileus."

Which of the  following agents is most likely to be active in his disease",C,"Primary brain lymphoma is an aggressive extranodal non Hodgkin lymphoma. The majority of cases are diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subtype. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that competes with folic acid leading to cell death. Intravenous high dose (>3.5 g/m2) methotrex ate is effective in primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma due to its ability to cross the blood brain barrier at higher concentrations (>3 gm/m2). Although cyclophos phamide, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and vincristine are active in B cell malignancies, their CNS penetration is poor."

He underwent excisional biopsy, which  showed a CD20+, CD10+, grade 2 follicular lymphoma.  He noted a 15-pound weight loss over the past 3 months. PET-CT scans demonstrate disease both above and below the  diaphragm, with the largest node in the right groin measur - ing 5 cm. A bone marrow biopsy shows 20% involvement by  a low-grade process consistent with follicular lymphoma.  What is your recommended first-line treatment option",B,"Observation is not recommended in follicular lymphoma patients who have evidence of a high tumor burden. This includes patients who have “B” symptoms, such as night sweats, fever, or significant weight loss. Treatment is also indicated in patients who have bulky disease, threatened organ function, or cytopenias secondary to lymphoma. Excellent response rates have been observed with combi nation chemotherapy regimens and rituximab. With this combined approach, overall response rates are over 80% in several studies. Recently, two randomized studies com paring bendamustine and rituximab to either R CHOP or rituximab plus CVP showed equivalent overall response and complete response rates.1,2 Anthracycline containing regimens have been associated with a low but consistent rate of cardiotoxicity, and their use is not recommended in patients who have alternate treatment options.

"A 60-year-old male with follicular lymphoma is diagnosed  with stage III bulky disease. He is initially treated with rituxi - mab, cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine, and pred - nisone (R-CHOP) and achieves a complete remission. Three  years later, he progresses and is treated with bendamustine  and rituximab and achieves a partial remission by CT im - aging. He is started on maintenance rituximab, given every   2 months. Six months into maintenance dosing, he is found  to have a new axillary node (3 cm). Biopsy confirms recurrent  grade 1–2 follicular lymphoma. You would now recommend:  ",E,"Although overall response rates are high with induction therapy in follicular lymphoma, the majority of patients still relapse following traditional chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Maintenance rituximab has been shown to ex tend progression free survival in both the frontline and relapsed setting following rituximab containing combi nations. When patients relapse, multiple salvage com binations are effective. Generally, it is recommended to use alternative chemotherapy regimens in patients who progress within 1 year of the last regimen. Rituximab as a single agent is not recommended in patients who progress within 6 months of a rituximab containing regimen. This patient has previously received 300 mg/m2 of Adriamy cin with 6 cycles of R CHOP chemotherapy. Subsequent dosing of an anthracycline above 450 mg/m2 has been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of congestive heart failure. Localized radiotherapy can be palliative and is associated with local control, but is not generally associated with prolonged systemic control of relapsed lymphoma. Idelalisib is approved for relapsed follicular lymphoma following two lines of prior therapy."

You  inform him that he has achieved what depth of response,C,"The International Myeloma Working Group response cri teria would categorize this depth of response as a complete remission (negative SPEP/UPEP , sIFE/uIFE and negative bone marrow by immunohistochemistry). The free light chain has not yet normalized (0.25–1.65), so a stringent complete response has not been achieved. There are now criteria for minimal residual disease by flow cytometry, by next generation sequencing, and by MRI/PET/CT."

5 g drop in her hemoglobin  from her baseline. Which of the following would not be an  approved treatment option for first relapse,C,"Only pomalidomide and dexamethasone would not be in dicated in this patient who is in first relapse. There are a wide range of available regimens that are FDA approved for individuals with one to three prior therapies, all of which are effective, although the mode of administration (IV/SQ/ PO) and toxicity profiles differ. Pomalidomide is approved for patients with at least two prior therapies (including le nalidomide and bortezomib) who have demonstrated pro gressive disease within 60 days of the last therapy."
Which of the following monoclonal antibodies targets  SLAMF7 and activates NK activity,B,"Elotuzumab targets signaling lymphocyte activation mole cule family member 7 (SLAMF7) whereas daratumumab/ isatuximab target CD38, indatuximab ravtansine CD138. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death 1 (PD 1) mono clonal antibody."
"A 74-year-old female presents with relapsed IgG lambda  myeloma. Her history includes initial FISH studies: t(4;14)  translocation. Two years ago, she received induction ther - apy with bortezomib/cyclophosphamide/dexametha - sone followed by autologous transplant. She then received  maintenance SQ bortezomib every 2 weeks for 1 year, but  relapsed. She was switched to lenalidomide plus low-dose  dexamethasone but progressed after 9 months. A 2-month  course of lenalidomide/ixazomib/dexamethasone result - ed in progressive disease. Given her high-risk disease, you  recommend the following regimen:  ",B,"or D The initial FDA approval for daratumumab, an anti CD38 monoclonal antibody, was for patients with three or more prior lines of therapy. Subsequently, daratumumab has been approved with either bortezomib or lenalido mide for one to three lines of prior therapy. Elotuzumab/ lenalidomide/dexamethasone would not be indicated; there are no data combining elotuzumab in lenalidomide refractory patients. Similarly, there are no data to sup port carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone in lena lidomide refractory patients. Bortezomib/panobinostat/ dexamethasone is an FDA approved regimen, but this patient has progressed on bortezomib maintenance and became refractory to the oral boron based proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib. Answer D is a very attractive option: the patient has not been treated with either pomalido mide or carfilzomib; pomalidomide is active in lenalid omide refractory patients, and carfilzomib is active in bortezomib refractory patients."
"In the revised International Staging System, high-risk cy - togenetic features include the following:  ",C,"In the revised International Staging System, high risk cytogenetics by FISH includes t(4;14), t(14;16), and 17p.

"The mainstays of myeloma therapy are immunomodu - latory agents and proteasome inhibitors in combination  with corticosteroids (dexamethasone). The proteasome  inhibitors are reversible or irreversible, boron-based or  epoxyketone-based. One of the main pathways of inhibi - tion is through which of following",C,"Although a number of pathways for proteasome inhibition may contribute to clinical activity, the most well studied is through Nf kappa B."
"After 3 cycles of therapy, the patient began to  complain of loss of feeling and numbness in her feet that  has gotten worse and is now painful. You explain to the  patient that the neuropathy is from bortezomib and dis - cuss the following options with her:  ",B,Peripheral neuropathy can be a devastating treatment related complication in multiple myeloma. Treatment choices are limited and variably effective. The clinician Multiple Myeloma and Other Plasma Cell Dyscrasias 44 must be proactive in dose reduction or discontinuation in the setting of emergent neuropathy in an attempt to pre vent long term symptoms.
Which of the following is true of ASCT for myeloma,B,"Approximately 15% of patients achieve long, durable re mission exceeding 10 years following transplantation. However, there is not yet a plateau on survival curves with current treatment approaches. Patients with chemothera py sensitive disease have better outcomes posttransplant. The typical induction regimen consists of an immunomod ulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and corticosteroids. Melphalan, an alkylating agent, should be avoided as it can compromise stem cell mobilization and may increase the risk of myelodysplasia/acute leukemia."
A 45-year-old patient has newly diagnosed myeloma and is  treated with 4 cycles of lenalidomide and dexamethasone  (Rd) chemotherapy. He achieves a very good response and  is now in good performance status. Cytogenetics are nor - mal. Which of the following would be an ideal therapeutic  choice for this patient,B,"There are now four randomized clinical trials that have been completed (two published, two presented in abstract) comparing either transplant versus no transplant, or early versus late transplant. All four show definite improvement in progression free survival in the patients who receive an early transplant. Therefore, early transplant continues to be the recommended treatment. In addition, if the patient was considered ineligible for transplant, the current recommen dations are to continue the induction therapy indefinitely."
Which of the following is not a risk factor for progression  in MGUS,C,"The risk of MGUS evolving into active myeloma is approx imately 1%/year (cumulative). This can be further strati fied based upon the size of the M protein (>1.5 g/dL), the type of M protein (IgA or IgM), and an abnormal free light chain ratio (>8). Since this is cumulative, the risk of evolu tion increases over time."

You suggest start - ing him on treatment with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and  dexamethasone, as well as a bisphosphonate. In addition, as  part of his initial treatment plan, you suggest that the patient  should:  ",D,"The standard of care for newly diagnosed myeloma patients is for induction therapy, usually with a triplet (immunomod ulatory agent, proteasome inhibitor, and corticosteroids) followed by a consolidative high dose therapy with ASCT. Lenalidomide is now FDA approved as maintenance therapy post autologous transplant with improvement in progres sive free survival and, in some trials, overall survival."

What do you tell her regarding her prognosis and recom - mended management,B,"In children, induction regimens, such as ALL or for ag gressive non Hodgkin lymphomas, are usually effective. In adults, these regimens can induce remissions, but better results seem to be obtained with consolidation with allo geneic stem cell transplant. Topical mechlorethamine and imatinib are not known to be active treatments."

The most likely  diagnosis is:  ",B,"The development of and EBV+ lymphoproliferation in a pa tient with a history of previous organ transplant with ongo ing immunosuppression is indicative of PTLD. In this case, it is a polymorphic subtype. Absence of CD30 and CD56 ar gue against Hodgkin lymphoma and extranodal NK T cell lymphoma. The mixed inflammatory background and lack of light chain restriction argue against diffuse large B cell lymphoma."
This patient is referred to you. Positron emission tomog - raphy/computed tomography (PET-CT) shows multifocal  FDG-avid areas in the large bowel as well as the left ingui - nal lymph nodes. For initial therapy you recommend:  ,A,"This patient has what is best characterized as polymor phic PTLD. In these cases, some patients will respond to a reduction in immunosuppression alone. However, given the multifocal and symptomatic disease, it is most pru dent to treat rather than to wait for a slow response. Many patients will respond to rituximab with a reduction in immunosuppression with rituximab. For those with early lesions or polymorphic PTLD, combination chemo immu notherapy, such as R CHOP , is generally reserved for those not responding completely to a reduction in immunosup pression and rituximab."
"2 K/ μL and her  LDH is elevated at 462 U/L (ULN 248 U/L). Quantitative  assessment of serum EBV is 42,000 IU/mL. A core needle  biopsy of one of the larger cervical nodes shows a diffuse  infiltrate of large CD20 positive B-cells. The cells express  EBER and kappa light chain restriction. The most critical  next step in terms of evaluating the biopsy specimen for  diagnosis would be:  ",C,"This is suspicious for monomorphic PTLD. However, given that the original diagnosis was DLBCL, this also could be a recurrence after the patient had an increase in her immuno suppressive regimen. Since she had a male donor, evaluat ing the biopsy for XY chromosomes will quickly tell you whether it is the donor or the host. If it is the donor, this is PTLD and can be treated accordingly. However, if it is the host, this is a recurrence of her lymphoma and represents a failure of the transplant."
The karyotype comes back as XY showing a donor origin  for the lymphoma. Your initial therapy recommendation is:  ,B,"Rituximab. Reducing immunosuppression is not likely to help when the PTLD is of donor origin. The donor’s im mune system will be unlikely to recognize the PTLD even if there is less immunosuppression. In addition, with the recent flare of GVHD, this could precipitate further GVHD. For similar reasons, DLI would not be helpful and would carry significant risk. Many patients with PTLD post al logeneic SCT respond to rituximab. R CHOP is likely not ideal here as it carries more toxicity than the single agent rituximab, and it is likely that this patient has had full doses of anthracycline in the past.

What is the objective of using a conditioning regimen for  hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation,D,"The pretransplant regimen is intended to accomplish two goals: ablate the tumor (autologous and allogeneic trans plantation) and achieve adequate immunosuppression to allow donor engraftment (allogeneic transplantation, only). Cancers treatable by HCT are usually those that ex hibit a strong dose sensitivity, justifying the treatment of patients with dose intense regimens. Bone marrow is also exquisitely sensitive to many of the agents used in the pre transplant conditioning regimens, which is the basis for infusion of HCT. Conditioning regimens range from fully myeloablative (which destroy the inherent hematopoietic function of the bone marrow) and nonmyeloablative or re duced intensity conditioning, which are chosen to be used in the elderly population or for transplant of nonmalig nant conditions, such as severe aplastic anemia."
What is the main mechanism of graft-versus-leukemia ef - fect using donor lymphocyte infusion,B,"Relapse is the main cause of failure after allogeneic HCT. The effect of graft versus tumor response depends on fac tors that improve the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize tumor specific antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II mole cules. Many tumors evade recognition by the immune sys tem by downregulating surface MHC, which is one reason for relapses after allogeneic HSCT. Other factors that con tribute are secretion by tumor cells of inhibitory cytokines, such as TGF beta."
Which of the following increases the risk of relapse af - ter an allogeneic and/or autologous stem cell transplant  (ASCT),D,"The inability to achieve a complete remission with prior chemotherapy is predictive of higher risk of relapse after autologous or allogeneic HCT. Aggressiveness of the tu mor is judged by disease responsiveness to induction regi mens as well as the duration of the response. Transplants may not be appropriate when the expected benefit is slim, such as in the setting of a large disease burden or rapid kinetics of tumor growth in the period preceding HCT."
Risk factors for increased acute and/or chronic GVHD are  all the following except—  ,E,"GVHD occurs after all allogeneic HSCTs. The likelihood of GVHD may vary based on the degree of HLA matching; for example, higher risk of GVHD in a mismatched unre lated HSCT compared with a matched unrelated HSCT and matched related HSCT. This is due to several factors not limited to major HLA matching. Mismatch at minor histo compatibility antigens also play a role in initiating GVHD. The more myeloablative the regimen, the higher the chance of acute GVHD as a result of tissue injury from the condi tioning regimen. Researchers found that using peripheral blood stem cells, compared with bone marrow stem cells, results in a higher incidence of chronic GVHD. Ultimately, the higher the cytotoxic T cell to the regulatory T cell ratio, the greater the GVHD. In addition, any insults in the form of infections, surgeries, or phototoxicity can trigger GVHD."
5 mg/dL.     What is the likely cause of his oral symptoms,C,"Acute GVHD presents with three organ involvement; GI resulting in nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and diarrhea; Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 52 skin resulting is varying degrees of rash; and liver result ing is rising total bilirubin. This patient has none of these. Chronic GVHD involves multiple organs. This patient does not seem to have any organ involvement of symp toms of GVHD. Tacrolimus toxicity occurs most common ly if blood levels are greater than 15 ng/mL. While some patients can be sensitive to tacrolimus even at lower levels, oral ulcers are very rare side effects of tacrolimus and do not typically occur at levels below 10 ng/mL. CMV reacti vation is a possibility following allogeneic HCT. However, both patient and donor are CMV negative, with very low risk of reactivation. In the post engraftment phase (30–100 days after hematopoietic cell transplant) infections relate primarily to impaired cell mediated immunity. The depth of this defect is determined by the extent of GVHD and im munosuppressive therapy in use. HSV , particularly CMV , are common infectious agents during this period. HSV typically causes painful oral sores, and a testing with viral cultures/PCRs is warranted."
"8 mg/dL, WBC 1200 cells/ μL. She has no known  preexisting liver conditions. What is the likely diagno - sis",E,"Hepatic SOS or, as it was previously known, venoocclusive disease (VOD) occurs after an injury to the hepatic venous endothelium. Preexisting liver disease, use of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, high doses of TBI, and female gender are all considered risk factors for SOS. The triad of clinical signs is weight gain, increased abdominal girth with ten der hepatomegaly, and rise in total bilirubin. Serial Dop pler ultrasounds of the liver will reveal reversal of portal vein flow indicative of sinusoidal obstruction. Thrombo cytopenia eventually ensues. Depending on the severity of the disease, it can be fatal. Immediate clinical diagnosis is necessary and treatment involves prompt institution of recently approved defibrotide along with aggressive sup portive care."
"Following HSC transplantation, what is the correct order  of immune reconstitution",A,"The recovery of the innate immune system (e.g., neutro phils, monocytes, and NK cells) is influenced by the graft type and is fastest with filgrastim mobilized blood stem cells, is intermediate with bone marrow, and is slowest with umbilical cord blood. This is followed by recovery of CD8+ T cells and B cells, whose counts may become supranormal transiently. B cell recovery is influenced by graft type (fastest after cord blood transplant) and is de layed by GVHD and/or its treatment. Subsequently, plas ma cells, and tissue macrophages/microglia, which are relatively resistant to chemo/radiotherapy, recover. The nadir of these cells may be lower in the presence of acute GVHD due to the graft versus host plasma cell effect. Fi nally, the recovery of CD4+ T cells is influenced by the T cell content of the graft and patient age (faster in children than adults). Therefore close monitoring of the patient’s immune reconstitution markers (e.g., IgG levels and CD4+ counts) assists in guiding physicians about discontinuing prophylactic antiinfective therapy."
2 mg/dL. A direct antiglobulin CHAPTER 12 Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Pashna N. Munshi and Corey CutlerHematopoietic Cell Transplantation 48 test returns negative. He is otherwise asymptomatic. He is  taking tacrolimus and sirolimus for prevention of GVHD.  Tacrolimus levels have been within 7–9 ng/mL range. A  bone marrow biopsy is without any leukemic blasts but  shows a slightly hypocellular marrow with increased  megakaryocytes and erythroblasts. What is the most likely  cause of his abnormal studies,D,"The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Net work (BMT CTN) operational definition of TMA requires the following: microangiopathic hemolysis (red blood cell fragmentation and ≥2 schistocytes per high power field on a peripheral blood smear), concurrent increased se rum LDH above institutional baseline, concurrent renal (defined as doubling of serum creatinine from baseline or 50% decrease in creatinine clearance from baseline) and/ or neurologic dysfunction without other explanations, and negative direct and indirect Coombs tests results. TMA may occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans plantation and is related, in part, to calcineurin inhibitor toxicity particularly in combination with sirolimus even when tacrolimus levels are within normal range (nano grams per milliliter). Acute GVHD affects the liver with rising total bilirubin and can suppress the bone marrow function; however, the patient has no clinical evidence of involvement of skin, gut, or hepatic systems. ITP can re sult in declining platelets and similar bone marrow biopsy findings, but it does not explain the rising creatinine. Re lapsed AML is unlikely in a bone marrow biopsy that is unrevealing of disease."
A 46-year-old man has IPSS Intermediate-2 risk MDS and  has an HLA-matched sibling available to be a stem cell  donor. Which of the following transplantation strategies is  the most appropriate recommendation for him,A,"Immediate transplantation from an HLA matched sibling is most appropriate. Given his age, a reduced toxicity ap proach is not recommended, and the decision to delay transplantation or not to undergo transplantation at all are both associated with a loss of total life years."
A 56-year-old otherwise healthy woman with AML pre - sents for evaluation for transplantation. She had a mono - somal karyotype at presentation and is in remission after  one induction course and a course of consolidation chem - otherapy. A suitably matched unrelated donor has been  identified from the Bone Marrow Donor Registry. Which  of the following transplantation strategies is the most ap - propriate recommendation for her,B,"Myeloablative transplantation should be offered. This woman has adverse risk AML by virtue of her monosomal karyotype; therefore, transplantation in first remission is in dicated. There is no advantage to pursuing further courses of consolidation chemotherapy prior to transplantation, and myeloablative transplantation is preferred over reduced in tensity transplantation on the basis of a large randomized trial, prematurely halted, that demonstrated improved outcomes in leukemic patients offered myeloablative trans plantation over reduced intensity transplantation."
Which of these statements is true,E,"The consensus recommendations from the CDC, IDSA, CIBMTR, ASBMT, EBMT, NMDP , and SHEA jointly sug gest using fluoroquinolones as primary prophylaxis to prevent bacterial infections for the period of neutrope nia. In case of drug allergy or other reasons, azithromycin 250 mg daily can be used instead. Due to lack of data, there are currently no antimicrobial prophylactic regimens that can be recommended for children. Some experts use levo floxacin for pediatric antibacterial prophylaxis."
9 mg/dL. He received a platelet transfusion yesterday for  platelet count of 9000 cells/ μL. What is the likely cause of  this patient’s symptoms,C,"Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor developed from a fungus. It reduced inflammation by decreasing cytokine release and subsequently interleukin 2. It is metabolized through the cytochrome p450 pathway in the liver and interacts with several drugs, such as like antiemetics and antibiotics. Such interactions can result in increased tac rolimus levels and signs of toxicity, including uncontrolled hypertension, headache, confusion, and renal insuffi ciency. Another concerning complication of tacrolimus toxicity is posterior reversal encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is usually reversible on drug discontinua tion. Therefore, this patient should get magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out any flare or hyperintensity in the T2 weighted diffusion images. CNS leukemia can result in headaches and vision changes, but is unlikely to cause renal insufficiency. HSV encephalitis is unlikely in a patient taking antiviral prophylaxis. Methotrexate toxic ity, while causing renal injury, does not cause headaches and confusion. Intracranial bleeds will result in stroke like symptoms rather than renal injury and confusion."
A 19-year-old woman is a stem cell donor for her 25-year- old sister with AML. She suddenly develops left upper  quadrant abdominal pain and has a near syncopal episode.  Her BP is 98/64 mm Hg with a heart rate of 118 beats/min - ute. She is on the third day of taking high dose filgrastim.  She denies any abdominal pain prior to this. She is other - wise healthy and has normal menses. Her last menstrual  cycle was 2 weeks ago. What is the reason for her abdomi - nal pain,C,Splenic rupture is a very rare yet potentially fatal complica tion of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G CSF) such Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 53 as filgrastim. Ectopic pregnancy is unlikely since female donors are screened for pregnancy prior to the collection of stem cells. She also just had her menstrual cycle recently. G CSF induced bone pain is more gradual in onset and is generalized and dull in nature. Pancreatitis typically caus es pain radiating to the midback and is associated with nausea and vomiting. G CSF is not known to promote kid ney stones.
"Your patient is a 57-year-old man with AML. He is CMV  IgG negative. His ABO blood type is O Rh+. You recom - mend that he undergoes an allogeneic stem cell transplant.  He has two sisters and one brother. His sisters are 45 and  63 years old. His sisters have no children, but his younger  sister has had one miscarriage in the past. His brother is 52  years old with mild hypertension. Who would you choose  as a donor",C,"The choice of a donor is of great importance because it can predict the outcome of the transplant based on HLA typ ing, age, gender, CMV status, and ABO compatibility of the donor. Matching donor and recipient for HLA class I ( A, B, and C) and class II ( DRB1 and DQB1) haplotypes is a key part of successful allogeneic HCT. A 12 of 12 HLA match refers to donor recipient pairs matched for HLA A, HLA B, HLA C, HLA DRB1, HLA DQB1, and HLA DP1 at the allele level. A full HLA matched donor is preferred over a mismatched or an unrelated donor. Many transplant centers are now performing half matched (haploidentical) donor transplants with the advent of posttransplant cyclo phosphamide and the low risk of graft failure. However, the transplant community is yet to reach a consensus on favoring these transplants over a full HLA matched donor. When available, a matched sibling donor is preferred over other donor sources due to improved clinical outcomes following transplant (e.g., less GVHD) and the speed and cost effectiveness of the search. As such, the initial search should center on molecular HLA typing of the patient’s full biological siblings. The next important screen is the donor’s age. A younger donor is always preferred over an older donor. The effect of donor age was best demon strated in a retrospective analysis from the Center for In ternational Blood and Marrow Transplant Research of over 11,000 unrelated transplants performed from 1988 to 2011 that evaluated the effects of various donor characteristics (e.g., age, sex, CMV serologic status, ABO compatibility, race, and parity) on recipient outcome. For every 10 year increment in donor age, there was a 5.5% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality. Older donor age was also associated with an increase in acute GVHD but not chronic GVHD. Recipients with female donors who had under gone multiple pregnancies have a higher rate of chronic GVHD than recipients with male donors or nulliparous female donors. Therefore, this patient’s 45 year old sister would not be an ideal candidate. The CMV serostatus im pacts transplant related morbidity and mortality in some studies (Schmidt Hieber M. et al, Blood 2013). CMV reacti vation is a challenging problem following allogeneic stem cell transplants, hence a CMV negative donor is favored for a CMV negative recipient. In choosing a donor, the physician must remember that the above mentioned fac tors only come into effect when there are multiple donor choices available. An unrelated donor search can be time consuming, and delays might result in disease relapse in the interim."
A patient with the following HLA type is scheduled to un - dergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation for MDS,D,"An HLA DQ β1 mismatched donor is the best option pre sented here. HLA A, B, C, and DR β1 are more important considerations over HLA DQ β1, which only minimally impacts on the rate of GVHD. Also note that allelic mis matches carry the same risk of antigenic mismatches."
"Concerning the following two donor recipient pairs, which  is the true statement (HLA disparities indicated in bold)",D,Recipient 2 is more likely to experience GVHD. Recipient 1 is homozygous at HLA B and is more likely to experience graft rejection due to the recognition of foreign HLA B. The risk of GVHD is not increased in the scenario. Donor 2 is homozygous at HLA A and is more likely to induce GVHD due to the recognition of foreign HLA A in the recipient. There is no increased risk of graft rejection in Recipient 2.
A 32-year-old man with adverse risk AML is scheduled to  undergo allogeneic transplantation. He has three biologi - cal siblings and two half-siblings. Which of the following  statements regarding the likelihood of finding a family  member for donation is true,C,"The likelihood of finding a match exceeds 50%. The likeli hood of finding a donor among biological siblings can be estimated by the formula: Likelihood of Match =1−(0.75)n where n represents the number of biological siblings. In this case, with three siblings, the likelihood of match is approximately 58%. Note that only full biological siblings should be typed when a full HLA match is sought. At most, half siblings can be haploidentical to their half sibling."
"4 g/dL and mild throm - bocytopenia 90,000 cells/ μL. He is reporting discomfort  during urination with increasing frequency. He feels he is  not being able to void completely. He notices his urine is  slightly dark and thinks he might have seen some blood.  What is your diagnosis",C,"The BK virus is a member of the polyoma virus. It can cause significant morbidity in an immunocompromised patient. Any urinary urgency, discomfort, or hematuria in a patient following allogeneic stem cell transplant should alert the physician for testing BK virus in the urine and subsequently blood. BK viruria is often asymptomatic, but warrants treatment if symptoms of pain, frequency, or bleeding occur. If left untreated, the BK virus can invade the kidneys and cause BK virus associated nephropathy (BKVAN), which can quickly become irreversible. Treat ment is with cidofovir and aggressive hydration with close follow up for BK virus clearing and renal dysfunction. Bladder cancer does not cause painful urination. Bladder stone is possible; therefore, a complete workup including renal ultrasound should be performed, although a blad der stone will not cause increased frequency. BPH does not result in hematuria or painful urination."
"A 54-year-old man is complaining of urinary bleeding 45  days following allogeneic stem cell transplant. BK virus in  the urine is 40,000,000 gEq/mL. He is on tacrolimus with  levels between 6 and 9 ng/ μL. He has mild skin GVHD,  which is controlled with topical triamcinolone cream. He  has had rising creatinine over the past 1 week and gradu - ally declining platelet counts. He is started on low dose  cidofovir 1 mg/kg intravenously three times a week. After  4 weeks of treatment, his hematuria has resolved and his  BK viral loads are 90,000 gEq/mL. He now reports right  eye tearing and pain that started 2 days ago. He denies any  fevers, cough, or cold symptoms. His right eye appears in - flamed with erythematous conjunctiva. His left eye shows  mild erythema. His vision in the right eye is blurry. The  light bothers him, and he prefers to remain in a dark room.  His 2-year-old grandchild recently recovered from con - junctivitis. What is the likely cause of his symptoms",E,"Cidofovir demonstrates in vitro activity against a num ber of DNA viruses, including the herpesviruses, adeno virus, polyomavirus, papillomavirus, and poxvirus. The most important toxicity of the drug is renal; this can be reduced by co administration with saline and probenecid, which blocks active renal tubular secretion. Acute iritis and ocular hypotony have also been associated with intra venous cidofovir and are usually dose dependent. Patients with ocular symptoms while on cidofovir need immedi ate evaluation by a retina specialist. Cidofovir should be permanently discontinued in these patients. Resolution of symptoms typically occurs with prompt diagnosis and ag gressive therapy with ocular steroids and supportive care. Acute angle glaucoma is unlikely in a patient without any history of glaucoma. Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis typi cally do not cause vision changes. Optic neuritis is a pos sibility, but typical symptoms are painful eye movements, which this patient does not have."
What is routinely checked in an asymptomatic patient fol - lowing a full matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  transplant (HSCT),B,"CMV is a common cause of morbidity and mortality fol lowing HCT. CMV PCR testing is routinely done since se rologic testing is not adequate for monitoring reactivation in an immunocompromised host who cannot mount an effective antibody response. The risk of CMV reactivation is highest when either donor or recipient is CMV positive. Preemptive treatment reduces CMV infections and mor tality. The BK virus is only tested if patients have urinary frequency, pain, or hematuria. Some centers perform EBV Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 54 testing as an early marker for posttransplant lymphopro liferative disease (PTLD), but this is not routine. HSV reac tivation is common, but less so if patients are on antiviral prophylaxis. Hepatitis B testing is only done on patients who are known to be positive prior to transplant. Post transplant risk of acquiring hepatitis B is practically zero due to stringent blood bank quality measures."
What category of patients should receive antibiotic proph - ylaxis against pneumococcal infection,E,"Invasive pneumococcal infection (IPI) is a life threatening complication that can occur at any time point follow ing allogeneic HCT, particularly in patients with chronic GVHD or patients with low IgG levels. Antibiotic prophy laxis should be administered even to patients who have received pneumococcal vaccination (1) because not all strains are included in the vaccines, so the immunogenic ity of vaccines against the vaccine strains in HCT patients is only about 80%; and (2) because of the theoretic concern that strains not included in the vaccine will replace vaccine strains . Oral penicillin remains the preferred choice, but antibiotic selection depends on the local pattern of pneu mococcal resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics (i.e., second generation cephalosporins, macrolides, and qui nolones)."
75 L over a 24-hour period. Appropriate  diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers in this patient include:  ,D,"Day 4 is in general too early for severe acute GI GVHD, and an infectious etiology or the effects of conditioning chemotherapy should be considered. In the absence of a skin rash, the diagnosis of hyperacute GVHD is very un likely."
"A 42-year-old woman develops a generalized skin rash  over her face, torso, abdomen, arms, and legs 30 days af - ter allogeneic HCT for AML. The rash started out on her  chest and neck after she took a walk in her neighborhood  around midday. In 48 hours, the rash spread to her entire  body. She reports itching. She is taking tacrolimus and  sirolimus, the levels of which are therapeutic on recent  laboratory check. On examination, she has an erythema - tous macular popular rash involving her forehead, chin,  anterior neck, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs along  with excoriation marks over her thighs. What is the next  step in management for this patient’s clinical symptoms",B,"This patient has acute GVHD of the skin. Based on the body surface area involved, she has greater than 50% in volvement of the skin constituting stage 3 skin GVHD (generalized erythroderma) by Glucksberg criteria. While a skin biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis, the first step is to start the patient on high dose steroids. Ad ditionally, topical steroids may be added for additional supportive care, particularly for hypersensitivity and itch ing symptoms. Flare of acute GVHD is common following allogeneic HCT, and the incidence is higher in matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplants, increasing parity of the donor (female donors), and female donors to male re cipients. Acute GVHD is also triggered on direct exposure to the sun; therefore, patients should be instructed to wear sunscreen and protective clothing and to avoid the mid day sun. Increasing sirolimus will lead to added toxicity without additional benefit. Changing to another calcineu rin inhibitor will not be sufficient in this instance."
6 mg/dL. What is the next best step  in the management of CMV reactivation,C,"CMV reactivation increases morbidity and mortality fol lowing allogeneic HCT. Prompt preemptive treatment is needed to prevent organ involvement and damage by CMV . Valacyclovir is used for prophylaxis only, but once viral reactivation occurs, induction treatment is warrant ed. The threshold of starting therapy after viral reactiva tion varies in different transplant centers. In a patient with ongoing pancytopenia, ganciclovir or valganciclovir can worsen cytopenias. In a patient with normal creatinine clearance, foscarnet is a good treatment option and re quires supportive care with fluid and electrolyte infusions."
"A 52-year-old woman with AML is undergoing treatment  with foscarnet infusions daily for CMV reactivation since  2 weeks. She has ongoing leucopenia and anemia. She is  taking tacrolimus and MMF for immunosuppression. She  feels well and denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, ano - rexia, or skin rash. Yesterday she noted burning during  urination. Today she reports itching after urination. On  examination, you notice erythema in the inner labial folds.  There is no vaginal discharge and no ulceration. What is  the cause of her current complaint",D,"Foscarnet is excreted in the urine and can cause genital ul cers. Prevention of ulcers can be done with maintaining thorough hygiene after urination. Steroid cream can be used to relieve the symptoms of itching and burning. HSV can also cause genital ulcers. Sending of cultures from the sore is a definitive diagnosis; however, since this patient has been on foscarnet at least 2 weeks, the most likely cause of her symptoms is drug induced. GVHD does not affect a limited genital area. The patient does not have any vaginal discharge, thereby ruling out bacterial vaginosis and yeast infection."
A 27-year-old woman is undergoing a myeloablative dou - ble umbilical cord blood transplant for AML. She has poor  appetite lingering from the side effects of her conditioning  regimen. She is currently in complete remission. What is  the best choice of agent for prophylaxis against mold infec - tions,C,"Invasive mold infections have a trimodal incidence distri bution among allogeneic HCT recipients. Before engraft ment (i.e., during phase I), the main risk factor is prolonged neutropenia; therefore, the risk is higher with bone mar row and umbilical cord blood transplants, and lower with peripheral blood and nonmyeloablative transplants. In ad dition, the risk is higher among patients with prolonged low level neutropenia prior to transplant, such as aplas tic anemia patients. In phases II and III (peri and post engraftment), the main risk factor is severe cell mediated immunodeficiency caused by GVHD and its treatment. Therefore, recipients of transplants with higher risks for se vere GVHD (unrelated donor, mismatched transplant, hap loidentical) are at greater risk of mold infections. Patients at high risk for mold infections should be considered for prophylaxis with mold active drugs during periods of risk. Absorption of itraconazole and posaconazole is poor in patients who are not eating, so it is not a good choice for this patient. Also, posaconazole has not been studied in the pre engraftment phase of transplant. Voriconazole blood levels of at least 1 μg/mL are thought to be required for efficacy. Low voriconazole levels have been reported in patients with documented breakthrough infections. Break through mold infections have been recorded in patients taking caspofungin. Fluconazole has no activity against mold."
A previously healthy 50-year-old man with Philadelphia  chromosome ALL is being admitted for allogeneic stem  cell transplantation. Which of the following myeloablative  regimens is the most appropriate for use prior to trans - plantation,A,Total body irradiation based regimens are indicated in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia to reduce the rate of disease relapse.
Uncommon but serious side effects of myeloablative doses  of cyclophosphamide include:  ,C,"In high doses, cyclophosphamide is associated with hem orrhagic cystitis and cardiotoxicity. Hemorrhagic cystitis can be prevented with forced saline diureses and the use of MESNA, while there are no specific preventative meas ures for the cardiotoxicity. Supportive care, bladder irriga tion, and topical analgesia are indicated for the treatment of hemorrhagic cystitis, while cardiac care is based on the manifestations of the cardiotoxicity (pericardial, myocar dial, or arrhythmogenic)."
A 46-year-old man is undergoing high dose chemotherapy  with BEAM and ASCT for high-risk relapsed Hodgkin  lymphoma. Which of the following antiinfective prophy - laxis would you NOT give to this patient,B,"Antifungal prophylaxis extension is only needed if pro longed degree of neutropenia is expected, which is not the case here. Antibiotic prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone is standard practice in most transplant centers (alternately cephalosporin) and is typically continued until neutrope nia resolves, or it is changed to broader coverage if patients experience a neutropenic fever. Antiviral prophylaxis is rec ommended for at least 3 months following ASCT or longer if patients are getting more chemotherapy. TMP SMX is the preferred drug of choice for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumo nia (PCP) treatment and prevention. TMP SMX can delay engraftment and thus is not usually administered before engraftment occurs. TMP SMX is variably tolerated, and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 55 toxicities include myelosuppression, hypersensitivity, hy perkalemia, nephritis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis. The op timal dosage has not been defined in HCT patients. Many HCT programs use once or twice daily regimens (single strength or double strength tablets) 2–7 days/week, and all appear efficacious. PCP prophylaxis should be considered for ASCT recipients whose immunosuppression is substan tial, either from an underlying condition or its treatment. Such patients include those with underlying lymphoma, leukemia, or myeloma, especially when intensive treat ment or conditioning regimens have included purine ana logues (fludarabine, cladribine [2CdA]) or high dose corti costeroids."
6 with hepatic ten - derness and leg edema on examination. The most appro - priate initial investigation of his liver dysfunction is which  of the following,B,"VOD of the liver is clinically suspected, so a duplex (Dop pler) ultrasound of the liver is the best initial test. In com parison to traditional 2D ultrasound, duplex ultrasound can measure portal blood flow and document reduced por tal vein flow velocity, the absence of flow, and the reversal of flow in the portal system. A CT scan is useful to exclude other intraabdominal pathology, but is not as useful as ul trasound for evaluation of the right upper quadrant. Liver biopsy is reserved for equivocal cases on ultrasound and should be performed in conjunction with intrahepatic ve nous pressure measurements to document VOD."
"A  high-resolution CT scan of the chest shows bronchiectasis,  bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular opacities, and air  trapping. A trial of bronchodilator therapy failed.     What is your diagnosis",B,"BOS, a form of irreversible airflow obstruction (AFO), is the most common long term, noninfectious pulmonary complication of allogeneic HCT. The current definition of BOS includes (1) FEV1 less than 75% predicted and an ir reversible ≥10% decline in less than 2 years; (2) FEV1 to vital capacity ratio less than 0.7 or the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval of the ratio; (3) absence of infec tion; and (4) either (a) preexisting diagnosis of chronic GVHD, (b) air trapping by expiratory CT, or (c) air trap ping on PFTs by residual volume (RV) greater than 120% or RV/total lung capacity (TLC) exceeding the 90% con fidence interval. It is very important to exclude other di agnoses, including idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, COP , pulmonary fibrosis, and late radiation effects, infection, asthma, or COPD, and rare disorders such as tracheomeg aly, tracheobronchomalacia, or α 1 antitrypsin deficiency. COP produces a restrictive pattern on PFTs. The patient here has an obstructive pattern with evidence of air trap ping and the presence of chronic GVHD, which all identify the diagnosis of BOS."
What is the proposed treatment for BOS,D,"This patient has already developed symptoms of cough and dyspnea related to BOS, and therefore it is likely not enough that only an FAM regimen would prevent pro gression. High dose steroids, particularly in the setting of chronic active GVHD, is the preferred option in com bination with pulmonary directed therapy. PFT testing should be repeated every 3 months to assess for the FEV1 curve."
"9°F, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and  oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. The patient recently  stopped TMP-SMX and valacyclovir prophylaxis 1 month  ago. A restaging positron emission tomography (PET)-CT  scan performed 4 weeks ago revealed subtle bilateral in - terstitial infiltrate but no evidence of disease recurrence.  What is the likely diagnosis",B,"Pulmonary toxicity has historically been a frequent compli cation of high dose therapy with ASCT, particularly with conditioning regimens containing 1,3 bis[2 chloroethyl] 1 nitrosurea (BCNU, or carmustine). Numerous studies in lymphomas, malignant gliomas, and breast cancer have established a strong correlation between BCNU dose and pulmonary toxicity. This can occur weeks to years after carmustine exposure. The incidence of pulmonary toxicity is less than 10% when cumulative BCNU doses are less than 800 mg/m2 as a single agent, but in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, particularly cyclophosphamide, the tolerated dose is lower. Patients are usually treated with steroids. This condition can be severe and fatal at times. The patient has a normal heart rate making PE unlikely. She received appropriate prophylaxis against PCP for 6 months, and her PET CT does not show any suspicion of pneumonia or relapsed disease. COPD is unlikely in this young, otherwise healthy, patient."
Which of the following vaccines will you provide to a   patient within 1 year of a stem cell transplant,D,"Antibody titers to vaccine preventable diseases (e.g., tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella) decline during the 1–10 years after allogeneic or autologous HCT if the recipient is not revaccinated. Evidence exists that certain vaccine preventable diseases, such as pneumococcal infec tion, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b (Hib infection, measles, varicella, and influenza) can pose increased risk for HCT recipients. Therefore, HCT recipients should be routinely revaccinated after HCT so that they can experience im munity to the same vaccine preventable diseases as oth ers. In order for a vaccine to mount a clinically relevant response (e.g., a fourfold rise in specific antibody levels or a rise to a level considered protective), adaptive (T and B cell) immunity post transplant must have been at least partially reconstituted. B cell counts, which are typically zero or near zero in the first 1–3 months after HCT, return to normal by 3–12 months post transplant. MMR is a live vaccine and should only be offered 24 months following autologous and/or allogeneic HCT if the patient is with out any active GVHD."
"A 67-year-old man returns for his annual follow-up  visit. He underwent a matched related donor stem cell  transplant 1 year ago. He feels well and wants to travel  to Orlando, Florida, with his grandchildren. He is off all  immunosuppressant therapy and is without evidence of  GVHD. What is the current vaccination advised to this  patient",C,The patient is 1 year following allogeneic HCT. The CDC and ASBMT guidelines do not recommend administra tion of live vaccines to patients until 2 years following HCT or until they are free of an active flare of GVHD. Varivax can be given when patients fulfill the criteria to receive live vaccines. Shingles vaccine is not recom mended in this subgroup of patients. MMR and oral polio vaccine are both live vaccines and therefore not recom mended. Hib is a common encapsulated pathogen and patients should be vaccinated following autologous and/ or allogeneic HCT.
"On routine monitoring of a 60-year-old man 30 days af - ter a matched related allogeneic HCT, CMV reactivation is  noted at 1457 copies/ μL. Intravenous ganciclovir is begun  and bi-weekly levels are followed. After 2 weeks of thera - py, CMV PCR shows 2760 copies/ μL. What is the next step  in management",C,"After 2 weeks of therapy for CMV reactivation, if viral loads continue to increase, resistant strains should be considered and therapy should be switched. The addi tion of other therapies just increases the risk of toxicity without the benefit of the drug in case of CMV resistance. Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir and cross re sistance is likely. When possible, blood samples should be sent to a laboratory capable of documenting antiviral resistance."
"A 42-year-old man reports mild nausea, appetite changes,  loss of 2 lbs weight, and loose stools over the past 2 weeks.  He underwent a matched related donor transplant for  AML 45 days ago. He is taking tacrolimus 1 mg twice daily  and MMF 1000 mg 3 times daily. His tacrolimus blood lev - els are 7 ng/mL. He has undetectable viral loads as of last  week. His physical exam shows a mild erythematous mac - ular popular rash. He is applying hydrocortisone cream to  the rash. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD)/sigmoidoscopy, which was unremarkable. Pathol - ogy from gastric and sigmoid colon biopsies show single  cell apoptosis with crypt epithelium in the gastric fundus  and destruction of single crypts and glands with apoptotic  crypt abscesses in the sigmoid colon. What is the lead cause of his GI symptoms",A,"The patient has grade I GVHD findings in the stomach and grade II GVHD in the colon. Grading is a pathology criteria, which is different from the clinical stage of acute GVHD. MMF can also cause neutrophilic cryptitis and mimic GVHD on biopsy; however, since this patient has other signs and symptoms of GVHD, that is the likely di agnosis. CMV reactivation is unlikely if PCR in the blood was recently negative. However, immunohistology should be done to rule out CMV inclusion bodies. Tacrolimus tox icity does not cause this type of pathology.Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 56"
"A 49-year-old man comes for a follow-up visit 40 days af - ter ASCT. His past medical history is significant for CD15+, CD30+ nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. He under - goes 4 cycles of chemotherapy with ABVD. Restaging PET- CT show complete resolution of disease. Two months later  he reports new-onset chest tightness, cough, night sweats,  and fever 101°F. A repeat CT scan of the chest, abdomen,  and pelvis reveal bulky mediastinal adenopathy and en - larged inguinal lymph nodes. A biopsy of the right inguinal  lymph node is consistent with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin  disease. He receives 3 cycles of brentuximab vedotin and  achieves a complete response. One month later, he receives  high-dose chemotherapy with BEAM followed by ASCT.  What is the next best treatment approach for this patient",A,"Posttransplant consolidation treatment with brentuximab vedotin (Bv) for patients with high risk of relapse of Hodg kin disease is recommended based on the landmark phase III AETHERA trial. In this trial, 329 HL patients at high risk of relapse (defined as failure to achieve a complete remission with initial chemotherapy, evidence of disease progression within the first year after initial treatment, or the presence of extranodal involvement at the time of disease progression even if the period was longer than 1 year) following ASCT, achieved its primary endpoint and demonstrated a significant increase in PFS per independ ent review facility, with a hazard ratio of 0.57 and a P value of 0.001. Median PFS was 43 months for patients who received Bv versus 24 months for patients who received placebo. The 2 year PFS rate was 63% in the Bv arm com pared with 51% in the placebo arm. Bv is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) for intravenous injection comprising of an anti CD30 monoclonal antibody attached by a protease cleavable linker to a microtubule disrupting agent, mono methyl auristatin E (MMAE). The antibody drug conjugate employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but releases MMAE upon internalization into CD30 expressing tumor cells. This patient is at increased risk of relapse following ASCT due to a relapse within 12 months of frontline therapy as well as the presence of bulky disease. Single agent Rituxan has no role to play in this patient. Consolidation radiation therapy following ASCT is highly controversial and not practiced routinely. Observation would not be in the best interest of this pa tient. Allogeneic stem cell transplant would only be con sidered if the patient failed ASCT."
A 57-year-old man with new onset runny nose and rhi - novirus should delay his upcoming allogeneic HCT until  symptoms resolve.     Which of the following statements is true,E,"All statements are true. Then how can the correct answer be E? HCT candidates with URI symptoms at the time condi tioning therapy is scheduled to start should postpone their conditioning regimen until the URI resolves, if possible, be cause certain URIs might progress to LRI during immuno suppression. BK virus testing is performed on patients with urinary symptoms of dysuria, hematuria, and frequency."
You meet a new consult patient and together are reviewing  the pathology report from her recent surgery. Which of the  following profiles is least consistent with HER2-positive  breast cancer,B,"Identification of HER2 positivity can be challenging, but is of great importance in knowing when to recommend the addition of HER2 directed therapy for a patient. Based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO CAP) 2013 guidelines, HER2 positivity can be defined by at least one of the fol lowing parameters: immunohistochemistry score of 3+, a HER2/CEP17 ratio greater than 2.0, and/or a HER2 copy number greater than 6."
"A 50-year-old woman has a stage 2 HER2-positive breast  cancer and will receive a trastuzumab-based regimen. She  asks you about the toxicity profile. You reply that trastu - zumab is generally safe, but rare adverse effects can in - clude:  ",D,"Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that precisely tar gets the HER2 receptor. Although generally extremely well tolerated, one of the rare toxicities that can occur with trastuzumab exposure is cardiac toxicity, which mani fests as a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction. Rates of cardiac toxicity appear to be higher when trastuzumab is used concurrently or sequentially with anthracycline based therapy, and is typically reversible by withholding the drug and treating with cardiac medication. Other rare toxicities of trastuzumab include infusion reaction and in terstitial pneumonitis."
"4-cm invasive cancer, grade 2,  without lymphovascular invasion and with clear margins.  A single sentinel lymph node was negative. She comes in for a medical oncology opinion on management. What is  the preferred systemic recommendation",C,"Several database analyses have shown that small HER2 positive cancers carry increased risk of recurrence com pared with HER2 negative cancers of the same size. Long er duration trastuzumab based regimens provide efficacy, but may exposure a patient to excessive risk. The APT trial treated patients with predominantly stage 1 HER2+ can cer with a regimen of 12 weeks of weekly paclitaxel and Breast Cancer 68 trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab for a year. Therapy was extremely well tolerated and the rate of recurrence was extremely low, supporting the “TH + H” regimen as the standard of care for small HER2+ cancers."
"8 cm ductal  carcinoma in situ. Immunohistochemistry shows the tumor  to be ER >95%, PR 50%, HER2 3+. Adjuvant radiotherapy is  planned. What is the best systemic management plan",C,"DCIS is preinvasive breast cancer, requiring complete lo cal therapy and consideration of systemic methods to reduce the risk of local recurrence as well as the risk of new breast primary. NSABP B 24, which enrolled pa tients who had completed lumpectomy and radiotherapy for DCIS and randomized to 5 years of tamoxifen versus placebo, showed a significantly reduced risk of ipsilateral recurrent disease and contralateral new disease with the use of tamoxifen. More recently, NSABP B 35, a similarly structured trial, confirmed a similar benefit for aromatase inhibitors. In a healthy woman who had excision of ER+ DCIS, it would be appropriate to offer a 5 year course of endocrine therapy with either agent. While brief duration of HER2 directed therapy is being investigated in a clinical trial, there is no role for HER2 directed therapy for HER2+ DCIS outside of a clinical trial. Additionally, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is not necessary in the setting of non invasive disease."
8-cm macrometastasis. Adjuvant  chemotherapy and radiotherapy are planned. What is the  preferred next step in locoregional management,C,"ACOSOG Z 011 randomized patients who had a lumpec tomy and a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy and for whom adjuvant radiotherapy was planned to either completion dissection or no further axillary surgery. Im portantly, eligible patients were clinical node negative at baseline, had no more than three positive sentinel nodes, and had not received preoperative systemic therapy. No survival difference was seen between the two groups, in cluding at 10 year follow up. Additionally, patients who avoided axillary lymph node dissection had less perio perative complications and morbidity from the proce dure. This finding has led to a change in the standard of care for a patient with a positive sentinel lymph node from completion axillary dissection to no further axillary surgery."
What is best  systemic management for this patient,E,"The 21 gene recurrence score assay has been retrospective ly validated in both node negative as well as postmeno pausal patients with 1–3 positive nodes. Low scores less than 18 suggest a favorable cancer biology not responsive to adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, recent studies in node negative breast cancer patients with recurrence scores <11 and in those with 0–3 positive nodes with recur rence scores < 11 indicated that these patients had excel lent disease free survivals with endocrine therapy alone. Thus, particularly in this older patient with a history of a slow growing tumor, a score of 10 supports no role for chemotherapy and a focus on adjuvant endocrine therapy exclusively. For a postmenopausal woman with a node positive cancer, including an aromatase inhibitor is a fun damental part of adjuvant endocrine therapy."
"7-cm inva - sive ductal carcinoma, grade 3, with extensive lymphovas - cular invasion and three involved axillary lymph nodes. She  received adjuvant chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy.  She was then started on adjuvant tamoxifen. Although her  periods stopped during chemotherapy, within 4 months she  has had resolution of hot flashes and resumption of menses.  What is the optimal adjuvant endocrine therapy plan",D,"At minimum, adjuvant endocrine therapy for a premeno pausal woman with a hormone receptor–positive breast cancer consists of at least 5 years adjuvant tamoxifen. The SOFT trial explored the role of the addition of ovarian sup pression in combination with 5 years of either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) in premenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. The study enrolled patients with heterogeneous risk, and overall results of the study did not show superiority with addition of ovarian suppression over tamoxifen alone. However, in the subgroup of women younger than 35 years who re gained menses after adjuvant chemotherapy, the addition of ovarian suppression to endocrine therapy significantly improved survival outcomes compared with tamoxifen alone, with the ovarian suppression and AI regimen pro ducing the most favorable outcomes. Although 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy could also be considered, for a very young woman, addition of ovarian suppression is a preferred strategy."
"9-cm tumor with  negative resection margins, and 0/2 sentinel lymph nodes  involved. She comes to your clinic for systemic therapy  recommendations. Which option is least acceptable for  her",D,"Anthracycline and taxane based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for higher risk triple negative breast cancer. Shorter duration regimens, including AC × 4 and the nonanthracycline containing TC × 4, are acceptable for a T1cN0 triple negative breast cancer. There is considera ble interest in the role of platinum chemotherapy as part of neo/adjuvant management of triple negative breast can cer; however, a survival benefit from the addition of plati num chemotherapy has not been confirmed. Therefore, substituting a proven regimen for a carboplatin containing regimen would be the least acceptable option compared with the other more standard options."
"She underwent upfront lumpectomy and axil - lary lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide,  paclitaxel, and trastuzumab, as well as radiation therapy  completed 1 year ago. She has done very well and returns  to the clinic for a follow-up visit. She asks how she should  be monitored, and you reply:  ",C,"Follow up care for breast cancer survivors is well de scribed by evidence based guidelines and consists of an nual breast imaging, provider visits every 6 months with clinical examination for several years after diagnosis, and routine health maintenance. There is no role for other rou tine imaging or serologic testing in an asymptomatic pa tient, and further investigations are driven by emergent symptoms."
"A 68-year-old woman with a history of a T1cN0 ER-pos - itive, PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer has been  maintained on aromatase inhibitor for the past 2 years.  She is 5′5″ and weighs 185 pounds. She comes for routine  follow-up and asks what she can best be doing to optimize  her breast cancer care. You tell her:  ",C,"Emerging data have helped define target health behaviors in breast cancer survivors. Patients can be counseled to pursue regular exercise, preferably weight bearing to sup port bone health, maintain body weight, or lose weight if desired, and consume no more than one or two glasses of alcohol per day on average. Taking calcium and vitamin D can be encouraged to maintain bone health, especially for patients receiving aromatase inhibitors."
"A premenopausal 45-year-old woman is found to have  a screen-detected T1bN0 breast cancer, ER+/PR+, HER2  negative. She elects to have a bilateral mastectomy with  ipsilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy, which identifies a  6-mm grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma and a negative  sentinel lymph node. Which of the following is the pre - ferred treatment option",D,"This patient has been diagnosed with a low risk breast cancer. Because she is premenopausal, tamoxifen is the preferred agent for adjuvant endocrine therapy, recom mended for a 5 year course. The addition of ovarian sup pression to oral endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer was evaluated in the SOFT trial (Francis et al, NEJM 2014). In this trial, patients with lower risk cancer for which chemo therapy was not indicated did not benefit from the addi tion of ovarian suppression, and so ovarian suppression would not be indicated in this situation. Additionally, the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant is an ap proved agent for postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer, but would not be indicated in the care of a premenopausal woman with early stage breast cancer."
What is the best systemic management for this patient,E,"A 21 gene recurrence score of 31 is a high risk score, suggesting not only a higher risk of recurrence, but also suggesting benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. There fore, adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated, and either an Breast Cancer 69 anthracycline based or nonanthracycline based regimen could be considered. Because the cancer is hormone recep tor positive, adjuvant endocrine therapy is also indicated. She may experience a loss of ovarian function during chemotherapy, but is likely to regain menses afterward. Therefore, treatment with aromatase inhibitor alone is dangerous because the agent is ineffective in the setting of functioning ovaries. Data from ATLAS, ATTOM, and Ma.17 have all supported benefits of 10 years rather than 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal patients, and this strategy is recommended to reduce the risk of late recurrence."
"She proceeded Breast Cancer 59 with preoperative chemotherapy and received Adriamy - cin/cyclophosphamide for four cycles and paclitaxel for  four cycles, followed by a mastectomy and sentinel lymph  node biopsy. Pathology shows a pathologic complete re - sponse. She received postmastectomy radiotherapy and  has been in observation. Her menses stopped during treat - ment but resumed about 6 months after chemotherapy.  She comes in for a follow-up visit 2 years after completion  of chemotherapy. She is interested in trying to get preg - nant. How do you advise her",D,"Cohort analyses of women who choose to get pregnant after a breast cancer diagnosis have not demonstrated an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence. In fact, the population appears to have improved outcomes com pared with matched controls, an observation that has been referred to as the “healthy mother bias,” and may reflect subtle differences in tumor biology and expecta tions. Conventional wisdom tends to recommend waiting at least 2 years after initial diagnosis and treatment to con firm no early recurrence. This patient, with a history of triple negative breast cancer 2 years out from diagnosis, can be encouraged to pursue pregnancy if so desired."
"She reports a family  history of breast cancer in a paternal aunt at age 35, a his - tory of a brain tumor in that aunt’s child at age 10, and a  history of a bone cancer in a paternal grandmother. She is  referred for genetic testing. What is the most likely genetic  abnormality identified",D,"All listed mutations can increase the risk of development of breast cancer and can be assessed on multigene panel test ing. Of these, mutations in p53 (Li Fraumeni syndrome) are associated with development of cancer in very young women (<30 years old) and are more likely to be HER2 positive. Li Fraumeni is also associated with development of primary brain tumors, sarcomas, adrenocortical malig nancies, and leukemia. Additionally, there is an elevated risk of second malignancy in radiated fields, so radiation therapy should be avoided if possible."
"3-cm high-grade  cancer with extensive lymphovascular invasion and two  involved axillary lymph nodes. Systemic staging is nega - tive for distant metastatic disease. Anthracycline-contain - ing adjuvant chemotherapy is planned (cumulating dose  240 mg/m2). She has a history of hypertension, but is very  active and exercises 3 times a week at the gym. Which pre - chemotherapy cardiac evaluation is preferred",C,"The risks of cardiac toxicity with anthracycline based chemotherapy increase with older age, preexisting car diovascular disease such as hypertension, concurrent ex posure to other cardiotoxic medications, and cumulative dose. In a standard to higher risk patient, baseline cardiac evaluation is necessary prior to initiation of therapy. At minimum, an echocardiogram (preferred) or a multigated acquisition (MUGA) to confirm normal ejection fraction is recommended, although in this patient, cardiooncology consultation should be considered if there are any abnor malities seen on echo. Advanced imaging by MRI and/or cardiac markers are under study and are not recommend ed as part of routine care. There is no role for dexrazoxane in the adjuvant setting for less than 240 mg/m2 anthracy cline."
"A 52-year-old woman presents with right axillary discom - fort. On examination there are multiple enlarged right axil - lary lymph nodes and a 5-cm palpable right breast mass. A  biopsy of the breast mass shows high-grade invasive breast  cancer, negative for ER/PR, and HER2 3+. A fine needle  aspiration of an axillary node is positive as well. Systemic staging is negative for evidence of metastatic  disease. What  are the preferred approaches for this  patient",D,"and E The anti HER2 and HER3 antibody pertuzumab was ap proved to be used in the preoperative setting for locally advanced HER2+ breast cancer. The approval was based on data from the NeoSPHERE and TYPHAENA studies showing improved pathologic complete response when pertuzumab was added to taxane and trastuzumab based therapy. For a locally advanced HER2+ cancer, initiation of preoperative therapy with HER directed agents is prefer able to starting with an anthracycline to avoid the risk of upfront cardiac toxicity that could complicate subsequent use of HER2 directed therapy."
"Her axilla is clinically negative, and a chest x-ray  and right upper quadrant ultrasound are negative for meta - static involvement. What is the preferred next step",D,"Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy requires bal ancing risks and benefits for the woman with breast cancer as well as the developing fetus. Evolving cohort studies have demonstrated that use during pregnancy of several traditional modalities for breast cancer treatment, includ ing administration of standard chemotherapeutics during the 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as surgical procedures, do not appear to increase complications of pregnancy or fetal malformation above population baselines. Preterm delivery (<37 weeks), however, is a well described risk for newborn complication. Therefore, in the setting of locally advanced disease requiring preoperative therapy, it is acceptable to pursue an anthracycline and taxane based chemotherapy regimen to optimize surgical outcomes, and early delivery or even termination of the pregnancy are discouraged."
"Staging studies including CT scans of the chest,  abdomen, and pelvis show no definitive evidence of meta - static breast cancer. An upfront mastectomy is suggested  by surgical oncology; however, the patient expresses a  preference for breast conservation if possible, and neoad - juvant therapy is discussed. What preoperative systemic  therapy regimen do you recommend for this patient to  maximize her survival",B,"Standard therapy for higher risk triple negative breast can cer is anthracycline and taxane based chemotherapy, which can be given before or after surgery. Because this patient desires breast conservation, preoperative chemotherapy is indicated. There is significant interest in the role of plati num chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer due to the DNA damaging method of action. Studies of pre operative cisplatin chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer have demonstrated robust response rates, especially for BRCA1/2 associated breast cancer. Trials evaluating the addition of carboplatin to anthracycline and taxane based chemotherapy have demonstrated an increase in pathologic response rate with the addition of platinum therapy; how ever, they also report conflicting information on whether this translates into improvements in survival. Therefore, for this patient with clinical T2N0 disease, preoperative anthracycline and taxane would be indicated, reserving platinum based preoperative therapy for a research setting preferably."
The preferred treatment option for this patient is:  ,C,"A grade 1 hormone receptor–positive, HER2 negative breast cancer in an elderly patient will exhibit greater sensitiv ity to endocrine therapy over chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy not only may increase the risk of toxicity in this patient but also may result in less than 10% pathologic complete response rate. Preoperative endocrine therapy is preferred in this situation and is recommended for at least a 6 month course before surgery for optimal cytoreduction."
"A fine needle  aspiration of an ipsilateral axillary lymph node confirms  involvement with carcinoma; systemic staging studies are  negative. He proceeds with preoperative Adriamycin/cyclo - phosphamide followed by paclitaxel, and then undergoes a  mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Pathology  shows residual invasive disease with 60% tumor regression,  2 of 14 axillary nodes involved, and 2 additional nodes with  evidence of fibrosis. Adjuvant postmastectomy radiotherapy  is planned. What is the preferred adjuvant therapy plan",A,"The annual incidence of male breast cancer in the United States is about 2000 cases. Treatment paradigms for male breast mirror those in women, because randomized trials in male populations are limited by the low incidence of the disease. Tamoxifen has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in men and is a preferred endocrine approach, as aromatase inhibitors are not well studied. In an individu al with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who has completed preoperative anthracycline and taxane based therapy yet has residual disease at surgery, there are no rec ommended standard adjuvant chemotherapy or targeted therapy programs that will decrease the risk of recurrence beyond endocrine therapy. Multiple ongoing trials are un derway to improve outcomes in this higher risk population."
7-cm invasive disease at the prior surgical  site with a negative deep margin and no involved axillary  lymph nodes. Systemic staging is negative for metastatic  disease. What is the next best step for her,D,"Local recurrence after initial breast cancer therapy sug gests elevated risk of distant recurrence. The CALOR study asked if further systemic chemotherapy could reduce this Breast Cancer 70 risk, randomizing patients with resected recurrent disease to further chemotherapy or not. Despite accruing a het erogeneous population, the study was positive showing additional therapy was beneficial, especially in hormone receptor–negative populations. In a patient who is at least 1 year out from adjuvant chemotherapy with locally recur rent triple negative breast cancer, further chemotherapy is warranted. Because this patient has received 240 mg/m2 cumulative dose of anthracycline, a further anthracycline based comprehensive regimen would push too close to lifetime limits in the curative setting. A nonanthracycline based regimen, for example docetaxel/cyclophospha mide, would be suggested."
"A 72-year-old woman with a history of stage 3 ER+/HER2  negative invasive ductal breast cancer presented to your  office with a complaint of a new chest wall lesion. She had  been originally diagnosed 4 years prior and, after a mas - tectomy and completion of adjuvant anthracycline-based  chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she recovered well and  had been maintained on adjuvant anastrozole. On exami - nation a hard fixed nodule was present near the mastec - tomy scar. A biopsy confirmed recurrent ER/PR+ HER2  negative grade 1 invasive breast cancer.     Best options for her:  ",B,"Given the presentation with a fixed chest wall lesion, this patient is not a candidate for upfront surgical resection and would benefit from preoperative systemic therapy. A low grade hormone receptor positive cancer in an older patient with a 4 year disease free interval suggests a tu mor biology best treated with endocrine therapy. As dis ease recurrence occurred while on aromatase inhibitor, a change to tamoxifen would be indicated. If chemotherapy is pursued, CMF would be a reasonable option, although not preferred over endocrine therapy. Neo/adjuvant capecitabine does not have a role in the curative manage ment of older women with breast cancer."
"The following patients present with a breast cancer diag - nosis, and are without systemic complaints. In which set - tings is systemic staging recommended",C,"and E Although helpful in detecting evidence of distant meta static disease, systemic staging carries the risk of findings that may lead to unnecessary further evaluation in an oth erwise nonmetastatic patient. NCCN guidelines recom mend staging for clinical stage IIB patients, patients with symptoms worrisome for distant spread of disease, and given the high risks associated, for those with locoregional recurrence. Staging is not needed for patients with lower stage or noninvasive disease."
"8 cm, was too large to obtain  an adequate cosmetic outcome, given the small size of her  breast. What is her best therapeutic  option",A,"Although this patient has operable breast cancer and can undergo a mastectomy for her clinical stage II disease, she wishes to preserve her breast; therefore the optimal thera peutic option for her is to receive neoadjuvant chemother apy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel, which is a standard adjuvant therapy regimen. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to result in a greater proportion of patients undergoing breast conserva tion, with a comparable disease free survival and overall survival when standard adjuvant therapy regimens are ad ministered preoperatively. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy has only been studied in postmenopausal women; therefore the option of using tamoxifen as preoperative therapy is not standard, and anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, is not ef fective in premenopausal women. Radiation therapy as pri mary treatment of breast cancer is only used for palliation."
"An FNA of the left axil - lary lymph node was positive for carcinoma. Staging studies  including a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and  bone scan were negative for distant disease but confirmed  left axillary adenopathy and a left breast mass. Which of the  following is the most appropriate treatment option",A,"Although this patient has operable disease, her large tu mor size and palpable axillary adenopathy is best treated with preoperative systemic therapy to downstage her can cer and allow breast conservation. The large tumor size and palpable axillary adenopathy would not be optimally treated with breast conserving surgery but would require a mastectomy and lymph node dissection. In the case of HER2 positive disease, dual HER2 directed therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab administered with chemo therapy, results in a greater pathologic complete response rate compared with chemotherapy administered with tras tuzumab or pertuzumab alone. The NeoSphere study dem onstrated a 39.3% pathologic complete response rate when pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel was adminis tered preoperatively compared with a 21.5% and 17.7% PCR rate when docetaxel was given with trastuzumab or pertuzumab as single HER2 directed therapy, respectively. In North America, a regimen commonly administered in this setting is docetaxel, carboplatin, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab. In addition, pertuzumab is currently only FDA approved in early stage disease when administered preoperatively with trastuzumab and a taxane. Preopera tive therapy with tamoxifen is not effective in premeno pausal women."
"2-cm, grade 3,  invasive ductal carcinoma after undergoing her routine mam - mographic screening exam, which she has been diligent in ob - taining because of a family history of breast cancer. She wishes  to undergo breast-conserving therapy and therefore under - went an excisional biopsy and sentinel lymph node sampling,  which found two of three axillary lymph nodes involved with  disease and the medial margin was involved with ductal car - cinoma in situ. The maximum dimension of involvement in  the nodes was 3 mm, and there was no extracapsular exten - sion. The invasive ductal carcinoma was estrogen receptor  negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER2 negative.  What is the next best step in the management of her disease",E,"There is comparable survival outcome between mastectomy and breast conservation surgery with radiation. The optimal characteristics for breast conservation include the ability to resect the entire tumor with negative surgical margins, be cause there is an estimated twofold higher risk of an in breast recurrence with positive surgical margins. The definition of negative margins is no evidence of invasive or noninvasive cancer seen at the inked surgical margins; therefore the next step in the management of this patient is a re excision of the biopsy cavity to obtain negative margins. ACOSOG trial Z0011 found no difference in axillary recurrence rate, disease free survival, or overall survival among patients with one to two positive axillary lymph nodes treated with sentinel lymph node sampling compared with completion axillary lymph node dissection when breast conservation surgery is followed by whole breast radiation therapy. Germ line mutations do not influence systemic adjuvant therapy rec ommendations, though in younger women, it may prompt a discussion about prophylactic mastectomy. The Oncotype Dx analysis applies only to estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. Combination paclitaxel and carboplatin is not consid ered a standard of care adjuvant regimen for breast cancer. The addition of platinum agents to adjuvant therapy in triple negative disease is still being investigated, and if pursued, should be given in addition to Adriamycin and cytoxan chemotherapy."
"9 cm. She underwent a  core needle biopsy of both areas with the pathology reveal - ing invasive lobular carcinoma, well differentiated, with  no lymphatic vascular invasion. Estrogen receptors were  positive, progesterone receptors were positive, and HER2  was negative. Which of the following is the most appropri - ate next step in her management",D,"Multicentric disease, defined as carcinoma in more than one quadrant of the breast, is associated with a significant risk of in breast recurrence when breast conservation and radiation therapy are used.1 A separate excision of distinct foci of breast cancer followed by radiation is being inves tigated and is not the standard of care at this time. Pre operative systemic therapy with either endocrine therapy or chemotherapy will not change the ultimate surgical procedure, which is mastectomy. The sizes of the foci of cancer are very small, and preoperative therapy will not change the ability of the patient to undergo surgery, nor will it allow for breast conservation. Radiation is only used as initial therapy for breast cancer, that is, prior to systemic therapy or surgery, when palliation is indicated."
"0-cm, grade 3, invasive ductal carci - noma with focal lymphovascular invasion. Estrogen recep - tors were positive, progesterone receptors were negative,  and HER2/neu was negative. Zero of 3 sentinel lymph  nodes were involved with disease. An evaluation of the  overlying skin demonstrated dermal lymphatic involve - ment with cancer. The invasive carcinoma was within 3  mm of the surgical margins, and ductal carcinoma in situ  was within 2 mm of the surgical margins. Which of the fol - lowing is true regarding the local therapy of this condition",D,"Breast conserving surgery is appropriate when negative surgical margins can be obtained following resection of the primary breast cancer and the cosmetic outcome of the breast is acceptable. Whole breast radiation therapy is giv en following breast conserving surgery, which results in a comparable overall survival compared with mastectomy. This patient meets the criteria for breast conservation. The presence of dermal lymphatic involvement seen on a skin Breast Cancer 71 biopsy can be seen at any stage breast cancer and does not denote T4 disease. Therefore, a completion mastectomy is not indicated, but if mastectomy is chosen, an immediate reconstruction can be performed. Sentinel lymph node dis section is associated with less upper extremity lymphede ma and other complications and is the procedure of choice for surgical evaluation of the clinically negative axilla. The false negative rate of sentinel lymph node dissection is approximately 8%, and therefore a completion axillary lymph node dissection is not indicated in this patient."
"0-cm, grade 2, invasive ductal carcinoma,  which involved 1 of 3 sentinel lymph nodes. The invasive  carcinoma was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone  receptor positive, and HER2 positive. She received ad - juvant carboplatin, docetaxel, and trastuzumab for six  cycles, and continued with maintenance trastuzumab  to complete 1 year of trastuzumab therapy. Although  she was menstruating regularly prior to  chemotherapy,  Breast Cancer 62 her menses stopped after her first cycle of treatment. It is  now 1 month after completing her chemotherapy and she  has not resumed her menses. Which of the following state - ments is correct",D,"Adjuvant endocrine therapy reduces the risk of disease recurrence and improves overall survival, and therefore should be offered to all patients with hormone receptor– positive breast cancer (estrogen receptor positive and/or progesterone receptor positive). Trastuzumab only targets HER2 and does not replace the need for endocrine ther apy. Options for endocrine therapy include AIs, which target aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens, and tamoxifen, which is a partial antagonist of the estrogen receptor. AIs are only effective in postmeno pausal women, and although this patient has experienced chemotherapy amenorrhea, she is young enough that her menstrual function may return within 1–2 years after com pleting chemotherapy. An AI should not be used in this setting because a return of ovarian function would render the treatment ineffective. Tamoxifen is effective endocrine therapy regardless of menopausal status; therefore it is the treatment of choice for this patient. If the patient’s men strual function resumes within 8 months of completing chemotherapy, then she may benefit from the addition of ovarian suppression to endocrine therapy."
She began anastrozole endo - crine therapy and has tolerated this treatment for the past 5  years. What is the next best step in management,C,"Multiple studies comparing the efficacy of AIs with tamox ifen as adjuvant therapy demonstrate superiority in the use of AI in postmenopausal women. A metaanalysis of these studies showed a 29% proportional reduction in risk of recurrence with primary treatment using an AI com pared with tamoxifen. The ATLAS trial demonstrated a 2.8% absolute reduction in death at 15 years when 10 years of tamoxifen was compared with 5 years of tamoxifen. Recently, the MA 17R study supported the benefit of pro longed AI use beyond 5 years. The majority of the patients in the study received 4–6 years of tamoxifen prior to begin ning extended endocrine therapy with AI. This patient is at high enough risk to warrant extended endocrine therapy. The use of tamoxifen following 5 years of an AI has not been studied, and fulvestrant is only used for advanced disease. Bilateral salpingo oophorectomy is not beneficial in a postmenopausal woman."
Which of the fol - lowing is the most appropriate treatment option for adjuvant   chemotherapy,C,"Adjuvant therapy recommendations should be based upon the final pathology determined at the time of sur gery. For this reason, although the original core biopsy contained HER2 negative disease, the final specimen was HER2 positive, and anti HER2 therapy should be offered. The ALLTO trial did not find a benefit when lapatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2, was added to trastuzumab (humanized monoclonal antibody to HER2) for adjuvant therapy. Although the addition of pertuzumab (humanized monoclonal antibody to HER2) to trastuzumab is beneficial for neoadjuvant therapy, this combination anti HER2 therapy is still being investigated in the adjuvant setting. The optimal adjuvant treatment for this patient is supported by the NCCTG N9831 study, which found that the addition of trastuzumab to standard adjuvant therapy using four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel with trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab to complete 1 year of anti HER2 therapy, resulted in a 48% improvement in disease free survival and a 39% improvement in overall survival."
"9 cm without lymphovascular  invasion. The carcinoma was estrogen receptor positive  and progesterone receptor positive as well as HER2 +3+  by IHC. Both of the two left axillary sentinel lymph nodes  were negative. In addition to radiation therapy to the left  breast, which of the following is the most appropriate next  treatment option",C,"This patient has a T1b, N0, HER2 positive breast cancer which would not meet the criteria for enrollment on any of the initial HER2 positive adjuvant therapy trials and yet, retrospective data suggest that T1b HER2 positive breast cancer may have up to a 30% risk of systemic recurrence. For this reason, HER2 directed therapy using trastuzumab is indicated in addition to endocrine therapy. In the ad juvant setting, trastuzumab is given concurrently with chemotherapy and continues for a total of 1 year duration. The risk of cardiac toxicity is elevated when trastuzumab is given concurrently with an anthracycline; therefore that combination is avoided. One of the standard chemothera py regimens for high risk HER2 positive disease includes doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by weekly paclitaxel with trastuzumab for 12 weeks followed by maintenance trastuzumab to complete 1 year. Recent data suggest that patients with T1b, N0 HER2 positive disease have a low enough risk of recurrence to allow them to avoid anthracyclines. In these cancers, adjuvant therapy includes weekly paclitaxel with trastuzumab for 12 weeks followed by maintenance trastuzumab to complete 1 year. Recurrence rates are low, less than 2%, and cardiac toxic ity is less than 0.5%. Endocrine therapy is initiated during trastuzumab maintenance therapy."
"9 cm. She received adjuvant chemotherapy  with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for four cycles  followed by paclitaxel for four cycles, and then began    tamoxifen. She has now been on tamoxifen for 5 years and  has been amenorrheic since initiating chemotherapy. What  is the next best step in management",B,"Extended endocrine therapy with 10 years of tamoxifen compared with 5 years of tamoxifen has been shown to reduce the absolute mortality associated with breast can cer by approximately 2.8%. However, the ATLAS trial demonstrated a higher risk of endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen for greater than 5 years. Clinical trial MA 17 demonstrated a comparable improvement in overall survival with extended endocrine therapy using 5 years of tamoxifen followed by 5 years of letrozole, without the added risk of endometrial cancer. The benefit of extended endocrine therapy appears to be more advantageous for high risk disease such as node positive breast cancer. The combination of tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor has not been shown to be superior to tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor given alone. Ovar ian suppression with bilateral stopping oophorectomy is not beneficial in postmenopausal women."
6 mm. What is the most  appropriate next step in management,C,"An Oncotype DX analysis on breast cancer specimens obtained from early stage disease provides both prog nostic data and predictive information about the benefit of adding chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy. This analysis was first used in estrogen receptor–positive, lymph node–negative early stage breast cancer, but has subsequently been found to be beneficial in identifying postmenopausal patients with lymph node–positive dis ease who would not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy. An Oncotype DX analy sis helps guide adjuvant therapy decisions in patients with 0–3 positive axillary lymph nodes and estrogen receptor– positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Oncotype DX Re currence Scores of less than 18 are not associated with an Breast Cancer 72 additional benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas scores greater than 30 predict an added efficacy when ad juvant chemotherapy is given in addition to endocrine therapy."
"5 cm, over a 9-cm area, without lymphovascular inva - sion. Estrogen receptors were positive, progesterone recep - tors were positive, HER-2 was negative, and six axillary  lymph nodes were removed without evidence of disease.  Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention",D,"Although one could consider prophylactic contralateral mastectomy given her maternal family history, this would not be the next most appropriate step. Genetic testing would first be recommended; in addition, prophylactic contralateral mastectomy has not been shown to improve overall survival in the absence of a documented germline mutation. Postmastectomy radiation therapy has not been shown to be of benefit in lymph node–negative disease. An Oncotype DX Recurrence Score analysis would pro vide predictive information on whether adjuvant chemo therapy, in addition to endocrine therapy, would result in an improvement in disease free survival compared with endocrine therapy alone. This is shown to be helpful in determining adjuvant therapy recommendations in stage II, node negative, ER positive, HER2 negative breast can cer. The SOFT trial determined that ovarian suppression, in addition to endocrine therapy, is of benefit to women who are 35 years or younger, and/or who have high risk disease requiring adjuvant chemotherapy."
"1-cm, grade 2, invasive carcinoma  with ductal and lobular features, involving 1 of 6 axil - lary lymph nodes. She received adjuvant chemotherapy  with dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide  for four cycles followed by dose-dense paclitaxel for  four cycles, and is now anticipating postmastectomy ra - diation therapy. Her last menstrual period was on the  day of her surgery; however, a recent estradiol level was  86 pmol/L. Which of the following is the most appropri - ate treatment option",B,"Although this patient has a high risk breast cancer that re quired adjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy is still an important component of her treatment. Chemotherapy often suppresses menstrual cycling, but it does not com pletely suppress ovarian function as is demonstrated in this patient who has a premenopausal estradiol level. Aromatase inhibitors are not effective in premenopausal women, and therefore tamoxifen is the endocrine therapy of choice. However, the SOFT trial demonstrated a 10%– 15% improvement in the 5 year breast cancer free interval when ovarian suppression was combined with exemes tane, compared with ovarian suppression and tamoxifen or tamoxifen alone. This was seen among the high risk pa tients who required adjuvant chemotherapy, such as this patient. As a number of patients do not tolerate ovarian suppression with exemestane, one can also consider ovar ian suppression with tamoxifen."
"3-cm, grade 1, invasive lobular carcinoma  of the right breast. She had breast-conserving surgery and  sentinel lymph node sampling that revealed 0 of 3 senti - nel lymph nodes involved. An Oncotype DX Recurrence  Score was 5, and she therefore opted to receive adjuvant  tamoxifen. Her last menses was during her surgery, and  she is now seeing you at her 6-month follow-up after com - pleting radiation therapy. The purpose of her office visit  is to discuss her treatment plan and long-term follow-up.  You discuss performing a physical exam every 6 months  for 3 years, followed by annual visits. Which of the follow - ing statements is correct concerning her scheduled follow- up screening",C,"Metastatic breast cancer presents with systemic symp toms, unlike early stage disease, which is curable. Routine imaging to detect systemic recurrence has not been shown to improve long term survival, and therefore CT scans and bone scans should only be performed when symptoms warrant an evaluation. Annual breast imaging with mam mograms are indicated because the detection of a new primary in the breast favorably impacts breast cancer sur vival. Premenopausal women on tamoxifen have a high er risk of developing osteoporosis, and therefore a bone density should be performed every 2 years. Transvaginal ultrasounds are associated with a high false positive rate among patients taking tamoxifen because tamoxifen caus es benign thickening of the endometrium and are therefore not recommended. Additionally, transvaginal ultrasounds have not been shown to detect ovarian cancer at an earlier stage."
She has now completed radiation  therapy to the right breast and is about to initiate adjuvant  endocrine therapy with anastrozole. Which of the follow - ing statements is correct,C,"Aromatase inhibitors have more musculoskeletal toxicity, such as myalgias, arthralgias, and increased risk of osteo porosis, compared with tamoxifen, whereas tamoxifen is associated with more endocrine related toxicities such as increased risk of thrombosis and increased risk of endo metrial cancer. Because of the reduction of estrogen associ ated with aromatase inhibitors, they are associated with vaginal dryness and decreased libido. Neither of the endo crine therapies is independently associated with increased weight gain. We do not have safety data for the adminis tration of oral estrogens among breast cancer patients re ceiving aromatase inhibitors, but randomized trials have suggested an increased risk of recurrence in breast cancer survivors who took hormone replacement therapy."
"5 cm. An ultrasound-guided  biopsy of the right breast contained a grade 3, invasive  ductal carcinoma that was ER negative, PR negative, and  HER2 negative. Which of the following statements is true  regarding this condition",A,"The rapid onset of changes within the breast such as er ythema, edema, and breast swelling, which occur in the setting of documented invasive breast carcinoma, are consistent with a diagnosis of inflammatory breast can cer. Confirmation of dermal lymphatic involvement with breast cancer is not required for this diagnosis and can be present in earlier stage breast cancer. Although this cancer is rare, accounting for 2%–5% of all breast cancers diag nosed in the United States, it can occur in men and is not associated with a specific inherited gene mutation. At the time of diagnosis, this disease is not operable, and there fore preoperative chemotherapy is indicated. Because the disease is extensive within the breast at the time of diagno sis, stage III, a modified radical mastectomy is performed following preoperative chemotherapy, and breast con serving surgery remains investigational."
"An 83-year-old woman was found to have enlargement  of the left breast with a patch of erythema and nipple in - version during a massage therapy session. This prompt - ed a visit to her primary care physician who had been  treating her for hypertension, diabetes, and congestive  heart failure. The patient states that she noted changes  within the left breast over the past 6–9 months; howev - er, her last mammogram was 5 years ago. A diagnostic  mammogram demonstrated marked nipple inversion  with a diffuse pattern of distortion within the center and a nodular density in the lower outer quadrant of the left  breast. A targeted ultrasound confirmed a poorly defined  hypoechoic area with associated skin thickening. She de - nied any pain, nipple discharge, or other symptoms. An  ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the breast mass con - firmed invasive lobular carcinoma, ER positive, PR posi - tive, HER2 negative. The patient had been living with her  daughter because of worsening hearing loss and early  dementia. Which is the following is the most appropriate  treatment option",E,"This patient presents with a locally advanced breast cancer with direct extension to the skin. Based on her history and clinical findings, that is, her compromised mental status, lack of screening breast imaging over many years, and hormone receptor–positive invasive lobular carcinoma, it is most likely that she has indolent disease. Given her comorbidities and the indolent nature of her disease, sys temic therapy is preferred compared with the potential toxicities of local therapy with surgery or primary radia tion. In addition, given the extent of her disease, primary systemic therapy is preferred. Hormone receptor–positive invasive lobular cancer is less responsive to chemotherapy, but endocrine therapy is very effective. Therefore, the op timal treatment for this patient is primary therapy with an aromatase inhibitor. In postmenopausal women, preop erative therapy using an aromatase inhibitor is superior to tamoxifen and is associated with a clinical response of 55% versus 36%, respectively."
"7-cm density with biopsy clip in place and multiple en - larged right axillary lymph nodes, right internal mammary  lymph nodes, and subpectoral lymph nodes. There was  extensive non-mass-like enhancement extending from the  nipple to the chest wall measuring more than 9 cm diffusely.  What is the most likely diagnosis",C,"This patient experienced a rapid onset (1 month duration) of erythema and swelling of the breast associated with a di agnosis of invasive breast cancer. The breast imaging con firmed extensive disease involving the skin, parenchyma, and regional lymph nodes. This constellation of signs and symptoms is consistent with inflammatory breast cancer, which is not operable at the time of diagnosis. The rapid onset of signs and symptoms does not support a neglected, indolent, locally advanced breast cancer. Trauma is not as sociated with the development of invasive breast cancer, but rather brings attention to changes within the breast."
4). An FNA of the right axillary lymph  node confirmed carcinoma. Which option is true regard - ing this condition,C,"This scenario describes a locally advanced breast cancer that involves the pectoralis muscle, is classified as T4c, and is not considered operable. Preoperative therapy is indi cated; however, the extent of disease warrants local control Breast Cancer 73 with a mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection regardless of disease response to preoperative therapy. Preoperative tamoxifen is not as effective as aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of locally advanced disease in postmenopausal women. Although neoadjuvant endo crine therapy is associated with a low PCR rate (1%–8%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not associated with a supe rior overall survival."
"0 cm, and right sub - pectoral lymphadenopathy. There was no sign of distant  metastases. A diagnostic mammogram and targeted ul - trasound of the right breast localized the mass in the tail  of the right breast, extending into the right axilla, which  was associated with bulky right axillary adenopathy. A  core biopsy of the right breast mass demonstrated a meta - plastic carcinoma. During the workup of her disease, the  patient developed significant right-arm lymphedema  and needle-like pain with movement of the arm, extend - ing into her right hand. What is the most appropriate next  step in management",A,"This patient has extensive locally advanced triple nega tive breast cancer that involves the right axillary lymph nodes and appears to be causing symptoms of a brachial plexopathy, that is, neuropathic pain within the right arm. Surgical resection of the cancer is unlikely to result in negative surgical margins and has potential to cause nerve damage during dissection of the axilla, given the extensive adenopathy. Because of effective preoperative chemother apy, radical mastectomies are rarely performed. Primary radiation to a bulky tumor is unlikely to be effective and is associated with significant toxicity because of the higher doses of radiation required. Metaplastic breast cancer is a rare subtype of triple negative breast cancer that responds to standard breast cancer treatment, such as doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. The optimal treatment for this patient is to administer preoperative doxorubicin and cy clophosphamide, with the goal of reducing the bulk of the tumor and reverse injury to the brachial plexus caused by tumor invasion. Endocrine therapy is not effective in ER negative, PR negative disease."
"A 48-year-old premenopausal woman palpated a mass  within the left breast. This prompted a diagnostic mam - mogram, which showed asymmetry at the 2 o’clock po - sition associated with a 9-mm hypoechoic mass demon - strated by ultrasound. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy  of the mass revealed a grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma  that was estrogen receptor positive and progesterone re - ceptor positive but HER2/neu negative. Because of the  presence of breast augmentation and small breast size,  she decided to undergo a mastectomy with implant recon - struction. The final pathology revealed a grade 1 invasive  ductal carcinoma, measuring 1 cm, estrogen receptor and  progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative, with 0 of  1 sentinel lymph node involved. She began tamoxifen but  quickly discontinued it after 3 months because of emotion - al intolerance. Three years later, her oncologist palpated a  small subcentimeter density along the lateral aspect of her  implant and a subsequent biopsy confirmed adenocarci - noma, which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone  receptor positive, and HER2 negative. A CT of the chest, Breast Cancer 66 abdomen, and pelvis and bone scan were both negative  for systemic disease. Which of the following is the most  appropriate intervention",A,"To determine whether this breast cancer recurrence is a new primary that arose within residual breast tissue left at the time of mastectomy, or a chest wall recurrence, the nodule needs to be completely excised. This recurrence oc curred within the first 5 years after diagnosis, and so it is less likely to be a second primary breast cancer. Because there is no evidence of disease elsewhere, radiation thera py is indicated to control the local regional disease follow ing a chest wall recurrence. Although endocrine therapy would be offered following surgery, and ovarian suppres sion is indicated in this premenopausal woman, endocrine therapy is recommended as an adjuvant treatment rather than primary therapy, that is, surgery. The lesion is very small by physical exam, and therefore presurgical systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, is not necessary to achieve an adequate surgical resection."
"5-cm lymph  node completely replaced by a poorly differentiated car - cinoma that was ER and PR positive and HER2 negative.  Staging studies including a CT scan of the chest, abdo - men, and pelvis and bone scan were completely negative  for distant disease. Which of the following is the most  appropriate treatment option",B,"An axillary lymph node recurrence without evidence of distant metastases suggests a failure of local regional dis ease control. This clinical situation should be treated with curable intent. Endocrine therapy will remain the main stay of treatment given the fact that her recurrent lymph node involvement remains estrogen receptor and proges terone receptor positive. However, this patient’s disease has a component of endocrine resistance because it grew on tamoxifen; therefore switching endocrine therapy alone would not maximize her adjuvant treatment. The CALOR trial demonstrated a benefit in 5 year disease free survival with chemotherapy compared with no chemotherapy (69% vs. 57%) when administered after an isolated local disease recurrence. The benefit was primarily seen in triple negative breast cancer. Given evidence of axillary lymph node disease that grew on endocrine therapy, the optimal treatment would include standard adjuvant chemothera py with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel. In hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, the addition of taxanes to an anthracycline regimen, such as doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence by an additional 26% and re duces the risk of death by additional 23%."
"Her most recent screening mammogram, in  2016, revealed a spiculated density within the left breast  confirmed by ultrasound to be a 1-cm hypoechoic mass.  She underwent an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the  left breast revealing an invasive ductal carcinoma, grade  2, without lymphovascular invasion. Estrogen receptors  were positive,  progesterone receptors were positive, and HER2 was  negative. What is the next best step in man - agement",B,"An in breast recurrence following breast conserving sur gery and radiation is associated with a two to threefold increase in the risk of metastasis; however, the majority of these “recurrences” are actually second cancers that occur more than 5 years after the completion of radiation thera py. This cancer occurred 18 years after the initial diagnosis and is most likely a second primary breast cancer with a curative goal of treatment. Local regional disease control with surgical removal of the tumor is of greater benefit compared with systemic therapy alone (chemotherapy or endocrine therapy), which is used for palliation. Because the breast has been irradiated previously, a completion mastectomy is indicated and an attempt at a second course of breast conserving surgery and/or re radiation remains investigational."
He works part  time. He plays tennis twice a week. He is motivated to  receive chemotherapy. What is the most appropriate   treatment option,A,"This patient has a node positive breast cancer and an ex cellent performance status. Male breast cancer is uncom mon, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer cases. The most common surgical operation for male breast cancer is a modified radical mastectomy. The axillary node involvement is the strongest predictor of local recurrence and distant recurrence. The indications for adjuvant chem otherapy and postmastectomy radiation therapy should follow the treatment recommendations used to treat wom en with a node positive breast cancer. Patients with lymph node–positive disease are candidates for chemotherapy. Given that the tumor is hormone receptor–positive, en docrine therapy is also indicated. For high risk patients, which this patient would be, given the involved nodes, an anthracycline plus taxane containing regimen is preferred and can be given, presuming he has no contraindication to being treated with an anthracycline. In this particular case, the indication for radiation therapy postmastectomy is that he has four or more nodes that are pathologically in volved. There is limited data regarding the indications for postmastectomy radiation in men, but the management of male breast cancer follows the recommendations for wom en with breast cancer. Tamoxifen is the most extensively studied endocrine therapy in male breast cancer."

He  is asking you what happens next with regard to his treat - ment. Which of the following is the next most appropriate  course of action",C,"The indications for radiation therapy for women with breast cancer apply also to men with breast cancer. After breast conserving surgery, whole breast radiation reduces the risk of local recurrence and improves survival. An ad ditional point to this question is that breast cancers that have at least 1% of cells staining positive for ER should be considered ER positive cancers. Endocrine therapy should be discussed. For men with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, endocrine therapy is recommended. Tamox ifen is the most extensively studied endocrine therapy in male breast cancer."
0-cm phyllodes tumor that  was greater than 1 cm from the margins. She presents to  you for a consultation. Which of the following statements  is true,C,"Phyllodes tumors of the breast, also known as cystosar coma phyllodes, are rare tumors composed of stromal and epithelial elements. They are characterized into benign, borderline, or malignant categories. Patients with a diag nosis of Li Fraumeni syndrome are described as having Breast Cancer 74 an increased risk of phyllodes tumors. The treatment is complete surgical excision. This should include a wide local excision and histologic margins negative for tumor. Recurrence rates are high after local excision or enuclea tion without negative margins. Axillary dissection is not required due to the infrequency of nodal disease, and in the absence of clinically palpable nodes. Adjuvant radia tion therapy is not necessary for widely excised benign phyllodes tumors. There have been no randomized studies of adjuvant therapy that have been conducted specifically in phyllodes tumors; patients with benign or borderline phyllodes tumors should not be offered chemotherapy."
Which of the following is the next most appropriate step  for this patient,A,"Angiosarcoma of the breast is a rare disease. It comprises about 0.04% of malignant breast neoplasms. Angiosar comas are a subtype of soft tissue sarcomas that have a vascular or endothelial origin. There are two forms of this disease. Primary angiosarcoma occurs in younger patients and is more likely to present as a palpable mass. Second ary angiosarcoma may occur after local radiation or in the setting of chronic postoperative lymphedema (Stewart– Treves syndrome). It is commonly referred to as cutaneous angiosarcoma and involves the subcutaneous tissues of the breast, while sparing the underlying breast parenchy ma. It most commonly presents as a violaceous or erythe matous lesion. It may be accompanied by a palpable mass. This patient has a diagnosis of secondary angiosarcoma or radiation associated angiosarcoma. Metastases from angiosarcoma are thought to primarily be hematogenous, and CT scanning should be considered prior to surgical resection. Due to the rarity of this tumor, there are no rand omized trials comparing wide local excision or completion mastectomy. Total mastectomy with or without an axillary node dissection is the preferred treatment. Administration of radiation is limited for secondary angiosarcoma as the area has likely received a maximum dosage. There is no definitive role for adjuvant chemotherapy."
"0-cm tubular carcinoma, grade 1, no lympho - vascular space invasion. The margins were free of tumor,  and three sentinel lymph nodes were negative for cancer.  Which option is the next best step to manage this patient",D,"Tubular carcinoma is a rare, subtype of invasive breast can cer with a prevalence of 1%–4%. It has an excellent long term prognosis. The analysis by Rakha et al. compared the biological behavior and outcomes of tubular carcinomas compared with low grade ductal or mixed tubular car cinomas and confirmed that patients with tubular carci nomas have a very favorable prognosis and an excellent outcome. The favorable histology of tubular carcinomas supports recommendations that adjuvant chemotherapy can be avoided. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is considered because most tumors are hormone receptor–positive."
"A 62-year-old female is referred to you by a dermatolo - gist. She describes a red, pruritic area on her left nipple  and areola associated with burning. She also noted some  flaking and scaling of the nipple skin of the left breast.  She applied some skin creams as she thought she had a  contact dermatitis. The dermatologist performed a shave  biopsy, and it showed that the epidermis was invaded by  large round cells with clear cytoplasm and hyperchro - matic nuclei, arranged in groups. On physical exam, the  left nipple was erythematous and slightly retracted. The  left nipple-areolar complex had some mild ulceration.  There was no palpable mass in the left breast. The right  breast had no skin changes or palpable masses. What is  the next best step in management",B,"This patient has a diagnosis of Paget disease, which is uncommon. Paget disease of the breast presents with a pruritic eczema like rash involving the nipple areolar complex. There can be flaking and scaling of the nipple skin, and nipple retraction. Associated symptoms include tingling, burning, or pain. In advanced stages, there can be ulceration, crusting, skin erosion, and a discharge. It is typ ically associated with underlying invasive or noninvasive breast cancer. Paget disease involves the nipple areolar complex. If the symptoms are bilateral or confined to the areola with sparing of the nipple, eczema is the more likely diagnosis. Histologically, Paget disease is characterized by large round cells with clear cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei, arranged in groups or singly, involving the epider mis of the skin. In this case a shave biopsy was obtained to confirm the diagnosis of Paget disease. A skin punch biopsy is sometimes performed. Further imaging with mammogram and/or breast MRI should be performed be cause in the majority of cases, there is an associated breast cancer. The presence of a concurrent breast cancer drives the type of surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), axillary nodal evaluation, and adjuvant therapy. For patients with localized Paget disease, breast conserving therapy with excision of the nipple areolar complex is recommended followed by adjuvant radiation therapy."
"A 65-year-old woman underwent a screening mammo - gram, and an abnormality was noted in her left breast. Ad - ditional imaging with ultrasound revealed a circumscribed  mass in the left breast measuring 7 mm. There was no axil - lary adenopathy. A core needle biopsy showed detached  papillary fragments, suggestive of part of an intraductal  papilloma and ductal hyperplasia. Which of the following  is true regarding this condition",C,"Intraductal papilloma is a type of papillary breast lesion and is a benign finding. Papillary breast lesions comprise a range of benign and malignant entities including intra ductal papilloma, atypical papilloma, papillary ductal carcinoma in situ, encapsulated papillary carcinoma, and invasive papillary carcinoma. These lesions can be diffi cult to differentiate based on the tissue fragments obtained from a biopsy. Because papillary lesions are heterogeneous, full histologic evaluation is necessary to rule out cancer or atypical hyperplasia. It has been reported that when a pap illary lesion is diagnosed by core biopsy, and then followed by surgical excision, the rate of the lesion being upgraded to a cancer ranges from 10% to 35% across several series."
"Degnim A C, King T ",A,"This patient has a HER2 positive breast cancer with symp tomatic visceral metastases. The best treatment option is dual HER2 blockade in combination with chemotherapy. The phase III CLEOPATRA trial was designed to evaluate dual HER2 inhibition through the addition of pertuzumab, a HER2 directed antibody, to trastuzumab and docetaxel for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Results showed that the median overall survival was 56.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.3 to not reached) in the group receiving the pertuzumab combination, as com pared with 40.8 months (95% CI, 35.8–48.3) in the group re ceiving the placebo combination (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56–0.84; P < .001), a dif ference of 15.7 months. Median progression free survival as assessed by investigators improved by 6.3 months in the pertuzumab group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58–0.80). The toxicity profiles of the two treatment groups were similar. As a result of this trial, pertuzumab plus trastu zumab plus docetaxel was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus taxane has been recommended by the National Com prehensive Cancer Network as a preferred regimen for the first line treatment of HER2 positive MBC. The patient is symptomatic, and anastrozole or letrozole with a HER2 targeted agent are not good choices for this patient. Ado trastuzumab emtansine is not approved as a single agent in the first line setting. Given the substantial survival asso ciated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab of over 56 months, there would be no reason to give only trastuzumab and paclitaxel as a first line regimen."
Which of the following is the most  appropriate treatment option,E,"Differential diagnosis of soft tissue mass in patients with a history of breast cancer treated with curative intent. The recommendation is for biopsy of metastatic disease as part of the workup of suspicious lesions in patients who present with metastatic disease, or at first disease recur rence after curative treatment. This is performed in order to confirm diagnosis of metastasis, and to determine the receptor status. This recommendation is endorsed by the NCCN Panel. Patients with beta thalassemia may develop extramedullary hematopoiesis, which may present as par aspinal masses. Recent use of chemotherapy may cause FDG avidity in any tissue with marrow activity, includ ing the extramedullary hematopoietic sites; placing it in the differential diagnosis with recurring/metastatic breast cancer. Answer A is not acceptable before tissue diagnosis of metastatic disease. Answer B would evaluate the anat omy of lesion, but would not provide definitive diagno sis.

Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor indicated for the treat ment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regi mens for the treatment of metastatic disease. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. This was based on the results of Eisai Metastatic Breast Cancer Study As sessing Physician’s Choice Versus E7389 (EMBRACE), a phase III study in pretreated metastatic breast cancer pa tients (previously treated with ≥2 prior chemotherapies, including an anthracycline and a taxane, unless contraindi cated) to compare overall survival with eribulin compared with treatment of choice. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 in 2–5 minutes intravenous bolus on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle or treatment of physician’s choice (TPC). TPC included any single agent chemotherapy, hormonal, or biological treatment approved for the treatment of cancer, radiotherapy, or symptomatic treatment alone. The primary endpoint of the trial was OS. A total of 762 patients were randomized as follows: 508 Breast Cancer 84 patients to eribulin and 254 patients to TPC. The study met its primary endpoint. Overall survival was longer for patients who received eribulin than for those who re ceived treatment of physician’s choice (13.1 months vs. 10.6 months; HR, 0.81; P = .04). Overall response rates (12% with eribulin versus 5% with TPC [ P = .002] and progression free survival also favored patients who received eribulin [PFS] was 3.7 months with eribulin and 2.2 months with TPC [HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.71–1.05; P = .137]). The majority of patients received chemotherapy (96%), which included vinorelbine (25%), gemcitabine (19%), and capecitabine (18%). The re maining 4% of patients received endocrine therapy, and no patient was treated with supportive care alone. Me dian number of prior chemotherapy regimens was four, and 73% of them had received prior capecitabine. Ixabepi lone and capecitabine is not necessary for this patient. Al though combination chemotherapy provides higher rates of response and longer time to progression, compared with single agent chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy is associated with increase in toxicity, and studies have not demonstrated a survival benefit. Single agent chemother apy is preferred to minimize the side effects. Combination cytotoxic regimens are usually given to those who are very symptomatic and have rapidly progressive disease. This patient is asymptomatic and has a volume of visceral dis ease that does not appear to be fast growing or appears to have any imminent threat of organ compromise. Doxoru bicin and docetaxel are not good choices for this patient, given prior treatment with liposomal doxorubicin and docetaxel, respectively."
"0-cm, ER negative, PR negative,  and HER2-negative, node negative left breast cancer. She  underwent lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and  received radiation therapy to the breast and four cycles  of adjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and cyclophos - phamide. Eighteen months ago, she was diagnosed with  biopsy-proven metastatic disease involving the lungs and  liver. She received weekly paclitaxel and experienced a  partial response lasting 12 months. Then her disease pro - gressed, and she began treatment with liposomal doxo - rubicin. Restaging studies after four cycles of liposomal  doxorubicin chemotherapy showed stable disease.

The phase III trial PALOMA 3 rand omized patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer that had progressed dur ing endocrine therapy to receive fulvestrant or fulvestrant combined with palbociclib. The median progression free survival with combined treatment was 9.2 months, and with fulvestrant alone 3.8 months. This study led to FDA approval of palbociclib/fulvestrant as second line therapy for patients with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer that had progressed on endocrine therapy. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus is an option combined with exemestane, not with anastrozole (answer B). There are no data on safety of palbociclib concomitant with ra diation. Upon progression on the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, it is preferred to use palbociclib in combina tion with fulvestrant, rather than with letrozole (answer C). Chemotherapy could be an option in the case of viscer al crisis; however, the presented clinical history does not suggest lung compromise is severe (answer D). Stopping denosumab will not address the problem of resistance to first line endocrine therapy (answer E)."

Scans reveal progres - sion of disease in the lungs and sclerotic lesions in the  bones without evidence of fracture. She denies dyspnea.  Oxygen saturation in room air is 99%. What is the best  course of action",B,"Lapatinib is an oral small molecule that targets the in tracellular kinase domain of HER1 and HER2. Lapatinib binds to intracellular ATP binding site of EGFR and HER2 preventing phosphorylation and activation. It causes re versible inhibition of HER1 and HER2 homodimer and heterodimer formation. A phase III trial was conducted that compared lapatinib and capecitabine versus capecit abine alone in women with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. All participants had been previously treated with an anthracycline, taxane, and trastuzumab. None had prior capecitabine. Patients were randomized to receive ei ther 1250 mg of lapatinib daily plus 2000 mg/m2/day of capecitabine days 1–14 every 3 weeks or capecitabine 2500 mg/m2/day on days 1–14 every 3 weeks. Treatment con tinued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The benefit of combining lapatinib with capecitabine was demonstrated. The median time to progression was 8.4 months in the combination arm, as compared with 4.4 months in the capecitabine arm (HR = 0.49, P < .001). These results led to the FDA approval of lapatinib in combination with capecitabine, in the treatment of patients with MBC that progress after receiving trastuzumab, anthracycline, and taxanes. The overall response rate was 22% (95% CI, 16–29) and 14% in the monotherapy group (95% CI, 9–21; P = .09), but this was not statistically significant, primarily due to the fact that fewer patients were enrolled than origi nally planned, and the study was noted adequately pow ered to evaluate this difference. The corresponding clinical benefit benefit rates were 27% for the combination and 18% for the monotherapy group. In the phase III trial evaluat ing capecitabine with or without lapatinib in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, fewer women in the lapatinib containing arm developed central nervous system metastases compared with the capecitabine alone arm (13 vs. 4 patients, respectively; P = .045). Thus in a patient like this with HER2 positive disease with brain metastases who has received prior therapy with chemotherapy, pertuzumab and trastuzumab, and TDM 1, lapatinib, and capecitabine is the most reasonable combination to administer, given la patinib’s potential for better penetration of the blood brain barrier compared with trastuzumab."
She is very motivated to continue with additional  therapy.  ,E,"When does trastuzumab need to be reloaded? According to a package insert of trastuzumab, if a patient who is on weekly schedule has missed a dose of trastuzumab by more than 1 week, a reloading dose of trastuzumab should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly schedule: 4 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent tras tuzumab maintenance doses (weekly schedule: 2 mg/kg) should then be resumed every 7 days according to the weekly schedule. Based on FDA recommendations, ECHO is typically repeated every 3 months while the patient is receiving trastuzumab (every 12 weeks). Navelbine does not require loading dose."
What do you order,C,"Surgical excision should be considered for patients with minimal or no evidence of extracranial disease, good performance status, and a surgically accessible single brain metastasis that is amenable to complete excision. To reduce the risk of recurrence in patients who have un dergone resection of a single brain metastasis, postopera tive radiotherapy should be considered. In 1998 Patchell and colleagues investigated the benefit of using whole brain radiation (WBRT) as an adjunctive therapy follow ing surgical tumor removal in these patients. The study randomized 95 patients to surgery alone or surgery plus (WBRT). Progression of intracranial disease was fourfold greater in the surgery alone group, and local recurrence was also higher in this group. Patients treated with sur gery alone received WBRT at the time of CNS disease progression, and so survival data did not reflect the ini tial randomization of the groups. There was comparable survival between the groups: surgery plus WBRT, median survival 12.0 months; and surgery alone, median sur vival 10.8 months. These data support the use of WBRT with surgery for improvement in recurrence and local control. Seizures are another problem affecting patients with brain metastases. However, this does not justify the Breast Cancer 85 prophylactic use of anticonvulsants, especially given that typical anticonvulsants have side effects that include cog nitive impairment, liver dysfunction, myelosuppression, and skin reactions. Systemic therapy does not need to be initiated in the absence of any extracranial disease."
Which of the following is the most  appropriate intervention,E,"Noninfectious pneumonitis as a complication of anticancer therapies in the metastatic setting. Noninfectious pneumo nitis (NIP) is a well recognized potential adverse event of everolimus. Its incidence is approximately 10%, with grade 3/4 incidence rates of 0.8%–5.0% in reports from BOLERO 2 and BALLET trials, with higher reported incidences within the older population. In the BALLET trial, NIP caused two out of four deaths attributed to treatment toxicity. Patients may present with nonproductive cough, dyspnea, with or without systemic symptoms of fever and fatigue. Many patients are asymptomatic, with signs detected on high resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the chest. The most common findings of HRCT are ground glass opacities, lobular sep tal linear thickening, and multifocal areas of lung consoli dation more commonly seen at bases. For NIP interfering with ADL, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and BAL are strongly recommended after HRCT rules out other causes/confirms initial suspicion. A respiratory infection would potentially be in the differential diagnosis, and amoxicillin and clavu lanate could be an option to treat this; however, everolimus should be on hold until HRCT is done (answer A). Refer ral to the allergist may be useful after HRCT rules out NIP (answer B). Exemestane is not associated with NIP (answer C). If a pulmonary embolism is suspected, a CT angiogram of the chest should be ordered, instead of US Doppler of lower extremities (answer D). The BOLERO 2 trial was a randomized phase III trial comparing exemestane plus or minus everolimus as treatment for ER positive HER2 nega tive metastatic breast cancer patients. Median progression free survival was 10.6 months with the combination and 4.1 months with exemestane alone. The BALLET trial was a phase IIIb expanded access safety study of everolimus and exemestane for patients with metastatic hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer.

The strongest evidence support ing the use of the antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T DM1, Kadcyla) in this setting comes from the EMILIA trial, in which patients with metastatic HER2 pos itive breast cancer were randomized to receive treatment with capecitabine/lapatinib or with trastuzumab emtan sine. In this study, most enrolled patients had not previ ously been exposed to pertuzumab. Patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine had significant longer disease free and overall survival, and less toxicity than patients receiv ing lapatinib/capecitabine. The median overall survival at second interim analysis was 25.1 months with lapatinib/ capecitabine and 30.9 months with trastuzumab emtan sine. The results of the EMILIA trial led to FDA approval of trastuzumab emtansine as second line treatment for pa tients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. A retrospective study of 78 patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine after being exposed to pertuzumab reported approximate ly 30% of the patients remained on therapy for 6 months or longer, with a tumor response rate of 18%.

Postmenopausal women with hormone responsive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) benefit from sequential use of endocrine therapies at disease progression. Women who respond to one endocrine approach with reduction in tumor volume or long term disease stabilization should receive additional endocrine therapies at disease progres sion. Results of the phase III randomized controlled trial Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus 2 (BOLERO 2) showed that postmenopausal women refractory to letrozo le or anastrozole, which are nonsteroidal aromatase inhibi tors, treated with a combination of everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, and exemestane, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhib itor, had an improved PFS of 10.6 months compared with 4.1 months in women treated with exemestane alone. This combination is a reasonable next treatment regimen for this patient. Combination chemotherapy is not indicated for hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative MBC that is limited to bone or soft tissue, or both. There are no data to use letrozole and palbociclib beyond the first line setting. Everolimus is only FDA approved in combination with exemestane and not anastrozole or fulvestrant."

She still has  minimal symptoms and denies any back pain. Which of  the following is the most appropriate treatment option",B,"For spinal cord compression, radiation therapy is directed at vertebral metastatic sites that are associated with sig nificant epidural involvement. Women who have recur rent hormone receptor positive HER2 negative disease are appropriate candidates for initial endocrine therapy. Breast Cancer 86 Postmenopausal women should be offered an aromatase in hibitor as first line therapy for their metastatic disease. The usual upfront choices are a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor such as anastrozole or letrozole. Two large randomized tri als in which postmenopausal women who were endocrine therapy naïve in the metastatic setting showed that anas trozole was at least equivalent to tamoxifen in the first line setting; unplanned subgroup analysis restricted to patients with known positive hormone receptors demonstrated a su perior TTP for anastrozole. Letrozole has also been directly compared with tamoxifen in the first line setting among women with MBC, and similarly increased the TTP . Anas trozole and letrozole, which are nonsteroidal AIs, are appro priate first line endocrine options in postmenopausal MBC. Based on the recent results of the PALOMA 1/TRIO 18 trial and FDA approval of the combination of letrozole and palbociclib, an oral small molecule inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6, addition of palbociclib to letrozole should be considered. The combination resulted in signifi cant improvement in progression free survival as first line treatment for advanced disease in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor–positive and HER2 negative breast cancer. Women with metastatic breast cancer to the bones may be considered for treatment with a bisphosphonate or denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against RANK ligand, a mediator of osteoclast function. These agents are used in patients with metastatic breast cancer to the bones and have been shown to prevent bone fractures, decrease bone pain, and prevention of skeletal related events (SRE). With regard to denosumab, a rand omized study showed equivalency and superiority of time to occurrence of an SRE with denosumab. Since this patient has hormone receptor positive MBC limited to bone, cyto toxic chemotherapy does not have to be utilized as first line, and endocrine therapy is preferred."
Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy,A,"Palliative care in patients with metastatic breast cancer. A discussion about goals of care would be appropriate in this case.

It is very unlikely that any additional anticancer therapy could change the outcome for this pa tient, and it could cause toxicity and additional suffering. Answer B is not appropriate, because the pain seems to be well controlled. Answer C: Most immunotherapy clinical trials would not enroll patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 2–4. This patient’s current PS is 3. Immunother apy is emerging as a potential anticancer strategy earlier rather than later in the treatment history of a patient, since the number of previous treatment lines may negatively affect the impact of immunotherapy against the disease. There are no approved immunotherapies for patients with ER/PR+, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Answer D is not appropriate because the listed tests will not change the medical recommendations. In some highly selected cases, though, scans confirming progression of disease may be required to enable a patient and/or family mem bers to make progress in the discussion of goals of care. This would be done after the failure of the approach de scribed in answer A. Answer E is not appropriate because patient is not experiencing nausea from chemotherapy or poor appetite."

The presence of “new” osteoblastic/sclerotic bone lesions may represent healing lytic lesions upon treatment with effective agents. Typical ly, a lytic lesion becomes blastic. Occasionally, smaller lytic lesions that were not appreciated at baseline scan may be detected after treatment because of changes to its character istics due to healing. Therefore with clinical improvement and no critical location for lesions, it would be acceptable to continue treatment and repeat scans in 8 weeks to en sure stability. Nothing on restaging CT or clinical history suggests spinal cord compression (answer A) or multiple myeloma (answer B). Findings are not compatible with denosumab toxicity (answer C). For accurate comparison among scans obtained at different time points, it is recom mended that the same modality be used for comparison. In addition, the number of documented sites of disease being followed for effect will not change the treatment recom mendation in the metastatic setting.

There is no role for surgical resec tion, given the extensive liver metastases. Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus taxane has been recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network as a preferred regimen for the first line treatment of HER2 positive MBC. Dual HER2 blockade is considered the standard of care for first line treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast can cer. However, docetaxel should not be given if AST and/ or ALT is greater than 1.5 × ULN concomitant with alka line phosphatase greater than 2.5 × ULN. LFT elevations increase the risk of severe and life threatening complica tions. A reasonable alternative is to treat with weekly pa clitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab in this situation.

The addition of palbociclib to letrozole result ed in significant improvement in progression free survival as first line treatment for advanced disease in postmeno pausal women with hormone receptor–positive, HER2 neg ative breast cancer. The trial enrolled 165 patients randomly allocated to receive either palbociclib (125 mg orally daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off treatment), plus letrozole (2.5 mg daily continuously throughout the 28 day cycle) or letrozole alone. Median progression free survival was 20.2 months in the palbociclib/letrozole group versus 10.2 months in the letrozole group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.488, P = .0004).

This patient demonstrates that she has a tumor that is resistant to anthracycline, taxa ne, and capecitabine, given the short time to relapse and the shortened duration on capecitabine. Ixabepilone (Ixempra, Bristol Myers Squibb) is the first epothilone to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ixabepilone as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer as monotherapy in patients whose tumors are resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine. The basis for FDA approval of ixabepilone as a single agent was an international, multicenter phase II trial conducted in 126 metastatic breast cancer patients whose disease was resist ant to anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine. Resistance to each agent was defined as progressive disease within 8 weeks of the last dose of the drug in the metastatic setting, or recurrence within 6 months of adjuvant or neoadjuvant anthracycline or taxane therapy. Approximately 88% of pa tients had received two or more prior chemotherapy regi mens for metastatic disease. Ixabepilone was administered at 40 mg/m2 as a 3 hour infusion every 3 weeks. The ORR based on independent radiologic review was 11.5% [95% CI, 6.3%–18.9%], and 13 out of 113 patients had a partial re sponse. In addition, 13% experienced stable disease for ≥6 months. Eribulin is not indicated, as she has not previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for treat ment of metastatic disease. Although combination chemo therapy provides higher rates of response and longer time to progression, compared with single agent chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy is associated with increase in toxicity and is of little survival benefit. Single agent chemotherapy is preferred to minimize the side effects. Combination cytotoxic regimens are usually given to those who are very symptomatic and have rapidly progressive disease. This patient is asymptomatic and has a volume of visceral disease that does not appear to be fast growing or appears to have any imminent threat of organ compromise. Therefore the combinations of paclitaxel/gemcitabine and docetaxel/capecitabine are not necessary for this patient.

T DM1 allows intracellular drug delivery specifically to HER2 overexpressing cells, thereby improving the therapeutic index and minimizing exposure of normal tissue. Ado trastuzumab emtansine as a single agent is indicated, for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Pa tients should have either received prior therapy for metastat ic disease or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. The drug was ap proved based on the results of the EMILIA study, which was a randomized, phase III international trial of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer, previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, to demonstrate the utility of ado trastuzumab emtan sine. In this study, 991 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to TDM 1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine.

Which of the  following is the most appropriate therapy",B,"Metastatic disease at first recurrence or at presentation should be biopsied as part of the workup for the patients with stage IV or recurrent disease. This ensures adequate determination of recurrent or metastatic disease and tu mor histology, and allows for determination of biomark ers for selection of appropriate treatment. In addition, given the potential for discordance between the receptor status of the primary cancer and metachronous metasta ses, biopsy of metastatic disease at the time of recurrence should be performed if it can be safely done to confirm the diagnosis, but also to guide therapies. Reported rates of discordance range from 10% to 40% and may reflect a true change in tumor biology, sampling error, or assay error. Since the FNA did not yield enough material for biomarker assessment, the next step is to surgically re move the lymph node to obtain enough tissue to assess ER, PR, and HER2. Starting therapy with fulvestrant or weekly paclitaxel are not correct. Therapy should not be started until an attempt is made to confirm the ER, PR, and HER2 status of the recurrence. A PET CT scan will not add additional information. The pleural effusion is small and still may not yield enough tissue to run the receptors."

In pre menopausal woman with previous antiestrogen therapy who are within 1 year of antiestrogen exposure, preferred therapy is oophorectomy, ovarian radiation, or LHRH agonists with endocrine therapy, such as aromatase in hibitors. Since she had prior antiestrogen exposure in the adjuvant setting with tamoxifen, it was reasonable to then treat her with ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor. Switching her to fulvestrant and palbociclib, a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, based on the PALOMA 3 study, is a reasonable next step. This combination was approved in the treatment of hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients, who have had prior endocrine therapy. This is a trial that randomized postmenopausal women who had prior aromatase inhibitor therapy, to fulvestrant versus fulvestrant and palbociclib. Premenopausal or perimeno pausal women also received ovarian suppression via a lu teinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist during the Breast Cancer 89 treatment period. The median progression free survival was 9.5 months in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib group, compared with 5.4 months in the fulvestrant plus pla cebo group, which was statistically significant [HR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.36–0.59; P < .0001]. Therefore, this would be a reasonable appropriate regimen to go to next in this pa tient who has had prior aromatase inhibitor and no prior palbociclib. There would be no reason to start off with li posomal doxorubicin, given she has minimal symptoms. Anastrozole cannot be used alone safely in premeno pausal females without concurrent ovarian suppression or ablation, since inhibition of the aromatase enzyme in the setting of functional ovaries will lead to ovarian hy perstimulation. Progestins, such as megestrol acetate, indirectly decrease serum estrogen levels by reducing androgen levels, and are usually utilized as a third and fourth line therapy."

Examples of proliferative lesions without atypia include moderate or florid ductal hyperplasia of the usual type, sclerosing adeno sis, radial scar, and intraductal papilloma or papillomatosis."
What characteristics distinguish lobular carcinoma in situ  (LCIS) from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),A,"Subsequent breast cancers after a diagnosis of LCIS are both of ductal and lobular phenotype, which has led to the acceptance of LCIS as a marker of increased risk rather than a true precursor lesion. The loss of expression of e cadherin is a marker of LCIS and infiltrating lobular car cinoma (LC; answer B). LCIS is a marker of increased risk and not a malignant or premalignant lesion; thus there are no data to support the use of radiation therapy for patients with LCIS, including pleomorphic LCIS (answer C). Re garding answer D, data from the IBIS II study support that anastrozole effectively reduces the incidence of breast can cer in high risk postmenopausal women, including those with LCIS. Regarding answer E, it is recommended that premenopausal patients diagnosed with DCIS (and not LCIS) undergo genetic counseling and testing."
A 42-year-old female found to have suspicious calcifica - tions of the left breast underwent a core needle biopsy  that showed LCIS. She subsequently underwent an exci - sional biopsy. The final pathology revealed LCIS with no  evidence of invasive cancer. She is otherwise healthy and  does not have any significant comorbidity. She is very con - cerned and wants to do everything to reduce the risk of  developing cancer.     Which is the most appropriate next step,C,"Data from NSABP P1, a large randomized trial comparing tamoxifen to placebo in high risk women, showed that ta moxifen decreased the risk of developing invasive breast cancer by 49%. Similarly, the NSABP P2 comparing ralox ifene to tamoxifen for chemoprevention in postmenopausal high risk women showed raloxifene to be as effective as ta moxifen. Women with LCIS were well represented in both of these studies, comprising 6.2% of 13,338 participants in NSABP P1 and 9.2% of 19,747 participants in P2 trial. In both subsets, chemoprevention reduced the risk of devel oping breast cancer by more than 50%. Overall results were Breast Cancer 94 confirmed in a systemic review for the USPSTF. Regarding answer A, as LCIS is a marker of increased risk and not a malignant or premalignant lesion, there is no indication for radiation therapy. Anastrozole is a consideration in post menopausal women with LCIS, but ovarian suppression and anastrozole would not be indicated for chemopreven tion purposes in premenopausal women (answer B). There are insufficient data to support annual screening with MRI for women who are of an elevated risk due to LCIS (answer E). While surveillance is an appropriate option, this patient expresses a desire to do everything she can to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer; thus answer C is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient."
1 cm in size. She under - went an excisional biopsy and was diagnosed with lobular  carcinoma in situ (LCIS). One of the margins was positive  for LCIS. There was no evidence of invasive cancer. She is  willing to undergo any treatment that could improve her  outcome. What do you recommend,E,"Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and LCIS are both as sociated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and the use of tamoxifen in these patients is associated with an ap proximately 40% risk reduction of invasive breast cancer. If LCIS is identified by a core needle biopsy, an excision biopsy must be performed to exclude the presence of inva sive cancer. However, if LCIS is diagnosed on an excisional breast biopsy, no further local therapy (surgery or radia tion) is required. Although consideration of bilateral total mastectomy is an option for a woman with LCIS without additional risk factors, it is not a recommended approach for most of these women."
Which of the following statements regarding pleomorphic  lobular carcinoma in situ is correct,B,"Re excision of positive margins for pleomorphic LCIS is recommended, given evidence supporting a greater poten tial of pleomorphic LCIS than classic LCIS to develop into invasive carcinoma. However, outcome data regarding treatment of patients with pleomorphic LCIS are lacking, due in part to a paucity of histologic categorization of vari ants of LCIS. Current recommendations do not endorse radiation therapy for PLCIS."
"A 46-year-old healthy premenopausal female undergoes a  screening mammogram and is found to have a cluster of  microcalcifications in the right upper outer quadrant, for  which biopsy is recommended. She does not have a fam - ily history of breast or ovarian cancer. Core needle biopsy  is performed and reveals pleomorphic LCIS. Your recom - mendations include:  ",C,"Re excision of positive margins for pleomorphic LCIS (PL CIS) is endorsed by the NCCN guidelines and other so cieties, given evidence supporting a greater potential for PLCIS than classic LCIS to develop into invasive lobular carcinoma. In addition, ipsilateral recurrence of PLCIS or of invasive breast cancer has been estimated at 3.8%– 19.4% of patients, suggesting that PLCIS may represent a precursor lesion to invasive cancer, rather than a marker for increased breast cancer risk. However, outcome data regarding treatment of patients with pleomorphic LCIS are lacking, due in part to a paucity of histologic catego rization of variants of LCIS. Current recommendations do not endorse radiation therapy for PLCIS. There are no data to support testing for HER2 in classic LCIS, pleomorphic LCIS, or DCIS outside a clinical trial. Surveillance without surgical management is not indicated for PLCIS, for the reasons previously mentioned."
The following statement about ductal carcinoma in situ  (DCIS) is correct:  ,C,"Since the implementation of mammographic screening, the incidence of DCIS in the United States significantly in creased from 6/100,000 women in the 1970s to 32/100,000 women in 2004, and then reached a plateau. DCIS accounts for approximately one fourth of breast cancers diagnosed in the United States every year. The risk of development of metastases in a patient diagnosed with pure DCIS is very low, below 1%. The majority of cases of DCIS are detected only on imaging studies. DCIS has been associated with deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes."
The following feature is associated with higher risk criteria  for DCIS:  ,D,"Comedo carcinoma is a type of DCIS. It is more often as sociated with invasion than other types. The degree of comedo necrosis in patients with DCIS appears to be a strong predictor for the risk of ipsilateral breast recurrence after treatment. High grade lesions are composed of solid nests of neoplastic cells without evidence of gland forma tion, and typically exhibit aneuploidy and lack estrogen and progesterone receptors (answer C). These lesions are at higher risk of recurrence. The larger the lesion, the worse the prognosis (answer B). Younger age has been implicated with higher risk of death from breast cancer in patients with DCIS. In a recent publication of consensus guidelines on margins for breast conserving surgery with whole breast irradiation in DCIS by the Society of Surgical Oncology, American Society for Radiation Oncology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology, a 2 mm margin was accepted as a new standard. Margins less than 2 mm are associated with a higher risk of local recurrence (answer E)."
"A 60-year-old woman who was diagnosed 9 years ago  with ductal carcinoma in situ of the left breast, status post - lumpectomy, radiation, and 5 years of tamoxifen relocated  from a different state. She now presents to your office to  establish care. Her physical exam is unremarkable, except  for mild breast asymmetry and the presence of a surgical  scar from her previous left lumpectomy. She brings her  most recent mammogram done 2 days ago, which reveals  a few small areas of microcalcifications at the lumpectomy  site. There is also asymmetry and distortion in the paren - chyma of her left breast. The mammogram report states  “BI-RADS zero.” Given the findings on mammogram, she  is worried that she has a recurrence of her ductal carcino - ma in situ or a new invasive breast cancer. What is the best  course of action",B,"According to guidelines from the American College of Radiology, mammographic reports must incorporate the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI RADS) as sessment in order to clarify mammography reports and to facilitate communication with other physicians. BI RADS zero is used when a mammogram has nonspecific abnor malities and additional views or ultrasound are required to complete the evaluation. It is also used when a comparison with prior mammograms is needed for a definitive report. Since the nonspecific abnormalities could still represent invasive or noninvasive disease, the request for previous films and proper comparison should happen within a mat ter of days. It would be inappropriate to reassure patient and obtain the next mammogram in 6 or 12 months (an swer A), or to go straight to biopsy (answer C). A biopsy would be the next step with BI RADS 4 or 5 ( Table 14C.1 ). Systemic staging with imaging would be appropriate if the patient had a diagnosis of locally advanced invasive breast cancer (answer D). Left mastectomy would be an option after histologic diagnosis of left breast DCIS or invasive breast cancer in this patient (answer E)."
"0 cm area in the upper outer quadrant  of her right breast. Ultrasound evaluation is normal. A bi - opsy performed under stereotactic guidance reveals pro - liferation of abnormal epithelial cells within the mammary  ductal system. These cells are large, pleomorphic with  frequent mitotic figures, and many of them had multiple  prominent nucleoli. The lesion has an area of central necro - sis. There is no evidence of invasion into the surrounding  stroma on routine light microscopic examination. Estrogen  and progesterone receptors are tested and highly positive  in the lesion. What is the most appropriate next step in  management",B,"This patient has a nonpalpable, asymptomatic area of mi crocalcifications. Pathology confirms hormone receptor positive ductal carcinoma. Both mastectomy and lumpec tomy are appropriate definitive treatments for patients with DCIS and are associated with similar survival. Mas tectomy is felt to be an overly aggressive treatment for many women. Approximately 70% of women with newly diagnosed DCIS are managed with breast conserving sur gery. Similar to what is seen in invasive disease, lumpec tomy as compared with mastectomy is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence, even when combined with radiation therapy. A long term follow up report from the NSABP B 17 and B 24 randomized clinical trials for wom en with DCIS revealed that after 15 years, invasive ipsi lateral breast tumor recurrence occurred in 19.4% of pa tients who underwent lumpectomy alone, compared with 8.5% of patients who received lumpectomy, radiation, and tamoxifen. After mastectomy, the local recurrence rate is estimated at approximately 2%. The use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in DCIS is controversial. If mastec tomy is performed, most agree SLN mapping should be done at the time of surgery. If the patient is treated with lumpectomy, it is most appropriate to postpone sentinel lymph node biopsy and only do it if invasive carcinoma is Breast Cancer 95 seen. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not indicated in DCIS (answer E). Endocrine therapy can be discussed after the definitive surgery (answers D and E)."
"A 38-year-old premenopausal woman was treated with  a right mastectomy for DCIS. The surgical margins were  free of disease. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were  positive. She is of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. After ge - netic counseling, she underwent genetic testing. No ge - netic abnormalities were found. She presents to your of - fice 4 weeks after mastectomy for postsurgical treatment  planning and consideration of additional treatments. You   recommend:  ",E,"Disease recurrence is estimated to happen in only 1%–2% of patients after mastectomy for DCIS. Therefore post mastectomy clinical follow up typically includes history, physical examination, and routine mammogram. The use of tamoxifen in premenopausal women with ER/ PR positive DCIS and after unilateral mastectomy may be considered, with an aim of preventing new primary contralateral DCIS or invasive breast cancer. This option was not presented in the question. Aromatase inhibitor is not an appropriate treatment option for premenopausal patients (answer D). Adjuvant chemotherapy is not indi cated, since the risk of systemic recurrence is extremely low (answer C). Likewise, there is no role for systemic staging with PET CT scans (answer A). Radiation thera py significantly reduces the risk of in breast recurrence. However, after mastectomy, radiation therapy is not indi cated for patients with DCIS (answer B) and would only be considered if margins are involved."
"5 cm in the greatest diameter. Margins  were uninvolved by DCIS. Estrogen receptor was positive  100%, and progesterone receptor was negative. Her medi - cal history was otherwise unremarkable. What would you  recommend",A,"After lumpectomy for DCIS, radiation therapy reduces the risk of in breast DCIS and invasive disease recurrence. In a metaanalysis of four randomized trials involving 3925 women, after breast conserving surgery for DCIS, there was significant benefit from the addition of radiation ther apy on ipsilateral breast event incidence (HR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.41−0.58). In a 15 year follow up from the NSABP B 17 study, the addition of radiation to lumpectomy improved the rates of ipsilateral invasive (19.4 vs. 8.9%) and DCIS (4.9 vs. 2.5%) recurrences when compared with lumpecto my alone. However, there was no benefit in terms of breast cancer–specific mortality at 10 years (0.9 vs. 0.8%), or of overall survival (84 vs. 83%). With regard to endocrine therapy after surgery, in a metaanalysis of 3375 patients with DCIS treated with or without tamoxifen, endocrine therapy led to a significant reduction in the risk of ipsilat eral and contralateral DCIS, as well as contralateral inva sive disease. However, there was no benefit of tamoxifen in all cause mortal. There has been an ongoing debate about the overtreatment of DCIS, particularly for those with good prognosis DCIS. Given this patient’s young age, the presence of necrosis, and the high nuclear grade, tamox ifen alone or observation would not be appropriate rec ommendations (answer B and C, respectively). Adjuvant chemotherapy is not indicated, since the risk of systemic recurrence is extremely low (answer D). Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo oophorectomy is not indicated as treatment for DCIS (answer E)."
"5-cm focus  of ductal carcinoma in situ, solid pattern, and intermedi - ate nuclear grade, with scant necrosis and negative mar - gins. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive in  greater than 90% of the cells. The patient had prolonged pain and discomfort after lumpectomy, requiring narcot - ics. She states “the surgery affected her health and energy  in a terrible way.” Her depression is severe and has been  well controlled in the past 6 years on fluoxetine/olanzap - ine combination. Her oncologist suggested discontinuing  endocrine therapy at this point. What would you do",E,"The treatment of DCIS with aromatase inhibitors is sup ported by the results of the phase III IBIS II trial, in which patients with hormone receptor positive locally excised DCIS were treated with tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years. Anastrozole met the noninferiority aim for that trial. In a metaanalysis of 3375 patients with operated DCIS and subsequently treated with or without tamoxifen, endo crine therapy lead to a significant reduction of the risk of ipsilateral and contralateral DCIS, and contralateral inva sive cancer. However, there was no benefit of tamoxifen on all cause mortality. The concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with tamoxifen is controversial. Pharmacologic interactions have been de scribed between tamoxifen and certain SSRIs with stud ies, suggesting that fluoxetine significantly decreases the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite endoxifen, thereby potentially affecting tamoxifen’s overall efficacy. However, a recent study evaluating outcomes of the 16,887 breast cancer survivors, in which 8099 used antidepres sants, there was no statistically significant increased risk of subsequent recurrence in women who concurrently used paroxetine or fluoxetine and tamoxifen. Tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolic events, in particular in women older than 55 years old, smokers, overweight/ obese, hypertensive, and with family history of coronary artery disease. In this patient with personal history of pulmonary embolism and multiple additional risk factors for tamoxifen related thromboembolic complications, it would be appropriate to recommend against tamoxifen as a choice of endocrine therapy for DCIS (answer D). Chemotherapy is not indicated as adjuvant treatment for DCIS (answer A). Right mastectomy would be potentially appropriate if the patient were interested in maximal risk reduction, even if this led to additional surgery. Unilateral mastectomy would decrease the risk of in breast recur rence to approximately 2% (answer B). Bilateral mastecto mies would decrease the overall lifetime risk of breast can cer to 2% (answer C) and is typically recommended when there is bilateral disease requiring mastectomy, or prophy lactically for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Neither unilat eral nor bilateral mastectomy has been shown to impact TABLE 14C.1 BI RADS Assessment Categories (American College of Radiology) Category 0 Mammog raphy: Ultrasound and MRIIncomplete— Need additional Imaging evalua tion and/or prior mammograms for comparison Incomplete— Need additional imaging evalu ation Category 1 Negative Category 2 Benign Category 3 Probably benign Category 4 Suspicious Mammography and ultrasound:Category 4A: Low suspicion for malignancy Category 4b: Moderate suspicion for malignancy Category 4c: High suspicion for malignancy Category 5 Highly sug gestive of malignancy Category 6 Known biopsy proven malignancyBreast Cancer 96 mortality in women with DCIS. Given the overall excellent prognosis in patients with DCIS and this patient’s comor bidities, close observation including routine mammogram without additional surgeries or systemic therapies would be the most acceptable choice."
"2 cm, and there was no evidence of invasive disease. The  closest margin was posterior, and the DCIS was 2 mm from  the margin. Estrogen receptor was strongly positive in 90%  of the cells. You recommend:  ",D,"In a recent publication of consensus guidelines on margins for breast conserving surgery with whole breast irradia tion in DCIS by the Society of Surgical Oncology, Ameri can Society for Radiation Oncology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology, a 2 mm margin was accepted as a new standard. The 2 mm margin minimizes the risk of ip silateral breast tumor recurrence compared with smaller negative margins. More widely clear margins do not sig nificantly decrease ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence compared with the 2 mm margins. Thus, in this case, next steps would include radiation and consideration of endo crine therapy for secondary chemoprevention."
8 cm. She has no comorbidities. Her physi - cal exam is notable for mild postradiation skin rash. She  wants to know what else she could do to treat this DCIS.  What do you recommend,C,"In women with hormone receptor negative DCIS, endo crine therapy does not affect the risk of recurrence. This was demonstrated by the NSABP B 24 study, in which patients with hormone receptor positive DCIS treated with tamoxifen had significant decreases in any subse quent breast cancer events compared with patients receiv ing placebo after surgery and radiation (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.81); however, no significant benefit was observed in those with hormone negative DCIS. Subsequent breast cancer events included ipsilateral or contralateral in situ or invasive breast cancers. Local treatment with lumpec tomy and radiation therapy is considered adequate, with out additional need for mastectomy (answer D). There is no role for chemotherapy due to low risk and overall good prognosis (answer E)."
"A 37-year-old premenopausal African American woman  presents with a lump in her right breast. She also has right  axillary discomfort. Mammogram reveals a large area of  microcalcifications.

Inva sive carcinoma has been reported in 10%–20% of excision specimens following a biopsy diagnosis of DCIS. If breast cancer is diagnosed, management of the invasive disease takes priority over DCIS. With proven invasive carcinoma metastatic to lymph nodes, the most likely scenario is of an occult invasive right breast cancer. With multiple ab normal matted lymph nodes, the most appropriate treat ment would include neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, postoperative radiation, and adjuvant endocrine therapy. Another possible option would be surgery first, followed by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and adjuvant endo crine therapy."

MRI brain is negative for disease. She is  now referred for treatment. What is the most appropriate  management",D,"The patient has bulky N2 disease and is likely to be in operable. In this case, the concurrent combination of chemotherapy and radiation would this be preferred. Neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery is a treatment op tion in patients with earlier stage resectable NSCLC. The utility of molecular testing in earlier stage NSCLC is not known, and targeted therapy in this population is only being delivered in the context of clinical studies."
"A 40-year-old woman presents to the oncology clinic for a  discussion regarding adjuvant treatment options. She un - derwent a right lower lobe lobectomy 4 weeks prior and  was found to have two separate lung lesions within the  right lower lobe resection specimen. Pathologic evaluation  revealed both lesions as squamous cell carcinomas, and  of 12/12 lymph nodes sampled, none revealed the pres - ence of cancer cells. The patient has recovered well from  her surgery and her KPS=90%. What is the patient’s tumor  stage and optimum treatment options",C,"T3: Separate nodule in primary lobe. The patient’s stage is T3N0, stage II NSCLC. The patient should be treated with adjuvant platinum doublet chemotherapy alone."

The left hilar LN is biopsied and  shows lung adenocarcinoma. Mutational analysis re - veals an EGFR exon 21 mutation L858R. A PET-CT shows  no evidence of distant metastasis. What stage cancer  does the patient have, and what is your optimal choice of   therapy",E,Stage IIIB: Chemoradiation with Cisplatin/Etoposide RTOG 94 10 randomly assigned 610 patients to either con current chemoradiation (Cisplatin/Vinblastine or Cispl atin/Etoposide) or sequential chemotherapy and radiation (Cisplatin/Vinblastine →RT) The 5 year OS was significantly higher in the concur rent regimen compared with the sequential treatment (16% and 13% in concurrent arms vs. 10% sequential arm).
"A 48-year-old male with an ECOG PS=1 presents to his  local ER with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder  for months, left hand muscle atrophy, and left-sided eye  ptosis. CT of the chest demonstrated a 7-cm lesion in the  left lung apex, and biopsy reveals a lung adenocarcinoma  in the superior sulcus. Discussion at a multidisciplinary  meeting reveals that the tumor is surgically resectable.  What treatment do you recommend",D,"The patient has an operable superior sulcus tumor. These are located in the lung apex and are often found to in volve either the first or second rib, chest wall, or the tho racic inlet. Symptoms from lesions in this location include shoulder pain, atrophy of hand muscles, and subclavian vein obstruction can occur. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (with hopes of surgery) is the standard of care Horner syndrome, which the patient describes with symptoms of myosis, anhydrosis, and ptosis. If completely resected, the 5 year survival rate is over 50%."

A 35-year-old female Taiwanese never-smoker is diag - nosed with metastatic NSCLC. Genomic analysis using  which of the following tests is most likely to guide her  choice of therapy,C,"KRAS mutations are found in approximately 25% of lung adenocarcinomas. At this time, they do not appear to pre dict for lack of benefit with targeted agents. Although there is interest in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) re ceptor alterations, they do not guide therapy with antian giogenic drugs. Up to 50% of female, Asian never smokers have mutations in the EGFR receptor, which might guide future therapy with EGFR targeted therapy."
A 73-year-old gentleman with stage IV lung adenocarci - noma is referred to you after completion of first-line cis - platin/pemetrexed chemotherapy. His tumor molecular  profiling reveals an EML4-ALK rearrangement. What is  the incidence of this genomic alteration in lung adenocar - cinoma,D,"EML4 ALK translocations occur in 3%–5% of lung cancer cases. For these tumors, crizotinib, an orally available ALK inhibitor, results in disease control rates of approximately 80%."
"A 60-year-old gentleman is found to have a right-sided  1-cm mass and a left lower lobe 3-cm mass on CT chest.  Mediastinoscopy reveals that all sampled LN do not con - tain cancer cells, and PET-CT and MRI brain show that  these are the only two abnormal lesions. Both lesions  undergo biopsy and show adenocarcinoma with EGFR  exon 19 deletion. What is the optimum treatment for this   patient",E,"The patient has two separate primary cancers. Each would be stage I since mediastinal staging is negative; there fore, management would be with curative intent with surgery."
"A 50-year-old never-smoker has a chest CT that reveals a  4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. A PET-CT  reveals distant disease with multiple liver and bone le - sions, with biopsy that confirms adenocarcinoma, TTF-1  positive. What is the next step in management",D,"EGFR mutations are normally found in patients with nons quamous histologies, and EGFR exon 19 deletions and the point mutation L858R in exon 21 predict for response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EML4 ALK is a genomic alteration found in 3%–5% of patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, and crizotinib is an approved therapy with dem onstrated improved efficacy in these patients compared with chemotherapy. This patient’s tumor sample should undergo molecular testing to assess for the presence of an actionable genomic alteration."
"A 60-year-old gentleman presents to his PCP for dyspnea  and is found to have a left-sided lung mass on CT, and bi - opsy reveals low grade/typical carcinoid tumor. A PET-CT  is ordered and reveals no other evidence of disease. Which  of the following is a true statement",A,"If found to be stage I carcinoid, surgical resection followed by observation would represent optimal management. Neuroendocrine tumors such as carcinoid tumors account for 1%–2% of lung tumors. Most lung neuroendocrine tu mors are asymptomatic."
"8-cm  mass in the right lung. A PET-CT reveals distant disease  with 10 liver lesions, and biopsy of one of these lesions  shows TTF-1 positive adenocarcinoma. Molecular testing  reveals a ROS1 rearrangement.     How common is this genomic alteration found in NSCLC",D,This is a rare genomic alteration seen in approximately 1% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
A 30-year-old never-smoker presents with newly diag - nosed lung adenocarcinoma and is found to have an  EML4-ALK rearrangement. What is the gold standard for  diagnosis of ALK rearrangements,D,"Flourescent in situ hydridization (FISH) testing is the gold standard companion diagnostic test for the diagnosis of EML4 ALK rearrangements. Immunohistochemistry can be used, however FISH remains the gold standard."
"A 42-year old patient with stage IIIB NSCLC is treated  with concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin and etopo - side and 60 Gy of thoracic radiation. Three weeks into therapy, the patient complains of difficulty swallowing  and chest discomfort. What is the likely diagnosis and rec - ommended management",D,Radiation esophagitis is a common side effect of this man agement approach and occurs in up to 50% of patients who receive this treatment. This should be treated with lido caine mouthwashes.
"In the same 42-year-old patient, 3 months after com - pletion of concurrent chemoradiation the patient com - plains of increasing dyspnea on exertion. A CT of the  chest reveals new interstitial infiltrates. The patient  denies chest pain, hemoptysis, sputum production, pu - rulent sputum, and has no fevers on clinical examina - tion. What is the likely diagnosis and recommended   management",E,Radiation pneumonitis is a common side effect of this management approach and occurs in almost 30% of patients approximately 3 months after completion of therapy. This should be treated with tapered doses of corticosteroids.
Systemic treatment for stage III NSCLC may be delivered  either neoadjuvantly or adjuvantly. The potential benefits  of neoadjuvant therapy do NOT include:  ,E,"The potential benefits of delivering upfront chemother apy include improved therapy completion rates, theo retical early treatment of micrometastatic disease, and assessment of pathologic response to therapy. Equivalent survival benefits are seen whether therapy is delivered ad juvantly or neoadjuvantly."
Which of the following agents is not a tyrosine kinase in - hibitor used in the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC,C,"Everolimus is an MTOR inhibitor. Erlotinib and gefitinib are first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, afatinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor against EGFR, while osimertinib is a mutant specific tyrosine kinase in hibitor that blocks T790M.Lung Cancer 106"
The following antiangiogenic therapies have demonstrat - ed a benefit in response and survival in NSCLC:  ,C,"Both bevacizumab and ramucirumab have demonstrated survival benefits when combined with chemotherapy in late phase studies in patients with advanced NSCLC. In the first line setting, the combination of carboplatin/ paclitaxel/bevacizumab improved overall survival by 2 months (10.3 vs. 12.3 months, P = .003), while the second line setting in the REVEL study demonstrated a 1.5 month benefit in overall survival compared with docetaxel alone in patients who had received platinum doublet chemo therapy first line."
The following chemotherapy regimens used in the man - agement of NSCLC are considered of high emetogenic   potential:  ,C,Cisplatin based chemotherapy regimens are of high em etogenic potential.
"A 70-year-old current smoker presents to his primary  care physician with a 2-month history of cough, sore  throat, and dyspnea on exertion. Antibiotics are given  without resolution of the patient’s symptoms. A chest  x-ray is performed showing a new 5-cm left lung mass.  Staging whole body PET scan shows uptake in the right  adrenal gland, L ileum, and fourth rib. MRI of the brain  shows a 3-cm lesion in the right frontal lobe with sur - rounding vasogenic edema. The lesion is not hemor - rhagic. The patient has no neurologic symptoms. His Lung Cancer 102 KPS is 80%. What treatment would be most appropriate  for this patient",D,"Proceeding to surgery for the patient’s brain lesion will be both diagnostic and therapeutic for this patient. The tissue obtained during the procedure will allow for histologic di agnosis of likely cancer, and it will also allow for the treat ment of a brain lesion with edema."
5 years. The patient is  furious that her primary oncologist has refused to treat her  with this drug. Which of the following best supports her  oncologist’s recommendation,C,"Early clinical trials examined the use of bevacizumab in patients with squamous cell lung cancers and cases of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage were reported. A rand omized phase II study evaluated the addition of beva cizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC, and showed improved response rates. However, the bleeding risk with bevacizumab was higher. Bleeding arose from centrally located tumors close to major blood vessels. It was felt that squamous histology conferred an increased risk of bleeding in part as they often occur near central vessels. Therefore, patients with squamous lung cancers should not receive this agent for safety reasons."
A 62-year-old gentleman with a 60-pack-year smoking his - tory has a PET-CT that reveals multiple liver lesions and  bilateral lung disease. One of the liver lesions is biopsied  and demonstrates squamous cell cancer that is p40 positive  without any other histologic components. Which of the fol - lowing would be your preferred management choice,D,"Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed are indicated for NSCLCs with nonsquamous histology. A randomized phase II study evalu ated the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitax el in patients with advanced NSCLC, and showed improved response rates. EGFR and ALK alterations are rarely found in tumors with squamous histology. Thus, of the options above, Carboplatin + Paclitaxel would be a reasonable regimen."
"A 33-year-old gentleman develops dyspnea and back pain  and is found to have multiple lung and liver lesions on a  CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. A biopsy of one of the  liver lesions reveals lung adenocarcinoma, which tests  positive for an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation. What treatment do you recommend for this patient",A,"Erlotinib. The Phase III EURTAC enrolled patients with treatment naïve, advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) to either erlotinib 150 mg per day or Cisplatin + Docetaxel or Gem citabine. PFS favored the erlotinib arm (9.7 months vs. 5.2 months; P < .0001)."
"The above patient begins treatment with erlotinib and has  a substantial reduction in all areas of disease.

The above patient’s tumor biopsy reveals transformation  to small cell lung cancer. What do you explain to the pa - tient about this occurrence and your choice of treatment,B,"In a minority of patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC, pa tients will develop acquired resistance through a mecha nism termed epithelial to mesenchymal transition where NSCLC appears to morphologically change to SCLC. At that time, patients should be treated with platinum/etopo side combination therapy."
A 55-year-old gentleman with stage IV ALK-arranged  NSCLC commences first-line crizotinib and sustains a par - tial response to therapy but develops a characteristic toxic - ity seen with this agent. The toxicity in question is:  ,D,"Crizotinib is relatively well tolerated, and clinical trials of this agent have included patients with performance status up to ECOG 3. The principal toxicities of crizotinib include nausea, diarrhea, transaminitis, and visual changes (e.g., floaters and flashing lights)."
Which of the following do you recommend,C,"The selection of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC is based on performance status and medical comorbidities. In fit elderly patients, first line platinum based doublet chemotherapy is well tolerated and demonstrates efficacy. Single agent docetaxel or erlotinib monotherapy are reason able options for second line therapy. The use of pemetrexed is restricted to nonsquamous histologies because of lower efficacy in squamous cell NSCLC."
"He will  begin first-line chemotherapy next week. In addition to  chemotherapy, what other intervention may lead to a sur - vival benefit",C,"In a study of early palliative care versus chemotherapy, Te mel and colleagues demonstrated improved quality of life, decreased depressive symptoms, and improved survival de spite less aggressive end of life care with early palliative care."
A 73-year-old woman with a 100-pack-year smoking his - tory is diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with squamous  histology. She receives carboplatin and paclitaxel for six  cycles and then develops progressive disease. She has an  excellent performance status. Which of the following is the  most appropriate treatment option for this patient,C,Single agent nivolumab is an anti PD 1 immunotherapy that has demonstrated response rates of approximately 20% and an improvement in overall survival of 3 months in the second line setting in patients with squamous NSCLC who progress after chemotherapy.
What targeted agent should be used for the treatment of  ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC  ,B,Crizotinib demonstrated a 73% response rate in a study of 50 patients treated with this agent with ROS 1 rearranged NSCLC and an improved progression free survival of 19.2 months.
A 55-year-old Asian male has stage IV ALK-rearranged  NSCLC and develops new metastatic disease to the brain af - ter first-line crizotinib. The patient has an ECOG PS=1 and is  symptomatic with headache. What is the optimum therapy,C,"Alectinib is an ALK inhibitor licensed for the treatment of ALK rearranged NSCLC after progression on crizotinib. A pooled analysis of two studies demonstrated a CNS re sponse of 61% for this agent and CNS duration of response of 9.1 months. Therefore, alectinib would be the treatment of choice in this patient."
A 66-year-old Jamaican woman presents with newly diag - nosed stage IV lung adenocarcinoma that possess a BRAF  V600E mutation. What is your treatment of choice for this  patient,D,A phase II study of the combination of dabrafenib/ trametinib in patients with stage IV BRAF V600E+ NSCLC demonstrated a response rate of 63%.
A 58-year-old male has stage IV NSCLC and develops pro - gressive disease in the lung and liver after receipt of ther - apy with first-line platinum doublet chemotherapy. Which  one of the options below is NOT a second-line treatment  option for NSCLC,E,Panitumumab is an EGFR monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of colorectal cancer.
A 54-year-old male has stage IV NSCLC and is receiving main - tenance pemetrexed therapy and develops progressive disease  in the brain with three isolated lesions with mild vasogenic  edema. The patient is mildly symptomatic with headache.  Which one of the options below would you recommend,A,"In patients with advanced NSCLC whose systemic disease remain unchanged with focal growth in an isolated number of lesions, local therapy to these lesions may be considered alongside continuation of the current systemic therapy. This approach is used for the subset of patients termed to have oligometastatic progression, which usually refers to pro gression in between 1 and 5 isolated lesions. In this case, the patient would be treated with SRS to the three new brain lesions, and systemic therapy would be continued."
"A 76-year-old male comes to see you to discuss treatment  options for advanced lung squamous cell cancer involving  the liver. His ECOG PS=0, and he has no comorbid con - ditions. He lives independently and can perform all his  ADLs and IADLs. Which therapy is best for him",E,Platinum doublet chemotherapy should be considered giv en the patient’s performance status. A phase III study of el derly patients aged 70+ years who had locally advanced or Lung Cancer 107 metastatic NSCLC with an adequate performance status had an improved survival outcome with doublet compared with single agent chemotherapy (10.3 vs. 6.2 months; P < .0001).
"A 36-year-old Japanese woman develops a persistent  cough for 8 weeks and has innumerable bilateral lung le - sions on CT chest. A PET-CT shows no disease outside of  the lung, and her brain MRI was negative. A peripheral  lung lesion was biopsied and demonstrated lung adeno - carcinoma with an exon 19 mutation in EGFR. Of note, her  breathing is getting more labored. Which of the following  treatments is best to start at this time",E,"Either erlotinib (EURTAC study) or Afatinib (LUNG LUX 3 study) are suitable treatment options for this patient. The Phase III EURTAC study randomized patients with newly di agnosed advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) to either erlotinib or platinum doublet chemotherapy, and a benefit in PFS was seen in the erlotinib arm (9.7 months vs. 5.2 months; P < .0001)."
"A 72-year-old gentleman with a 100-pack-year smoking  history presents with dyspnea CT Chest with IV contrast  shows a 5-cm left lung lesion and no enlarged mediastinal  or hilar lymph nodes, but a right-sided pleural effusion,  which when drained demonstrated squamous cell lung  cancer cells. A PET-CT shows no other evidence of other  disease. What treatment would you recommend",D,"The patient has stage IV NSCLC due to the presence of the confirmed malignant pleural effusion. The patient should be treated with palliative chemotherapy since the histol ogy is squamous in a patient with a significant smoking history, and the presence of an EGFR mutation is unlikely."
"A 59-year-old male has advanced lung adenocarcinoma  with metastases in the lungs, liver, adrenals, and bone. He  spends 90% of the day in bed or at rest and his family assist  him with self-care activities. What do you recommend in  terms of optimum management",A,"In patients with advanced lung cancer who have a driv er mutation (i.e., EGFR, ALK, ROS1) and have an ECOG PS=3–4, one could consider administration of targeted therapy. However, for a patient with an ECOG PS of 3–4, chemotherapy is unlikely to be of benefit."
A 50-year-old never-smoker has ALK-positive stage IV  lung adenocarcinoma treated with first-line crizotinib for  18 months but then develops progressive disease in the  lungs and liver. Which of the following treatment options  would you recommend for this patient,A,Several next generation ALK TKIs such as ceritinib and alectinib are treatment options in crizotinib refractory set tings and have demonstrated superior outcomes compared with chemotherapy in the second line setting. Ceritinib demonstrated a 58% response rate and a 7 month progres sion free survival in the second line setting after crizotinib failure in patients with stage IV ALK rearranged NSCLC.
is the diagnostic test most likely to determine the etiology  of the patient’s diplopia,D,"There is a close association between thymoma and myas thenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that often mani fests with weakness of the eyelids or extraocular muscles. Approximately 15% of patients with myasthenia gravis have a diagnosis of thymoma and approximately 50% of patients with thymoma will have myasthenia gravis at diagnosis or during the course of illness. Antibodies to acetylcholine receptor were the first described antibodies Other Thoracic Malignancies 117"
"0 g/dL Platelets 295,000/µL       Which of the following is the most appropriate next  step",B,"Pure red cell aplasia is a paraneoplastic phenomenon found in ∼10% of patients with thymoma. It is an autoimmune disorder that is associated with severe anemia, inappro priately low reticulocyte count, and preserved leukocyte counts. Severe anemia beyond the amount usually seen af ter administration of chemotherapy should raise the possi bility of this diagnosis. Pure red cell aplasia is often treated with corticosteroids, sometimes with the addition of cyclo sporine. Echocardiogram is helpful for identifying heart failure that could result from doxorubicin induced cardio myopathy; however, the patient has no clinical evidence of heart failure, and the patient has received a relatively small dose of doxorubicin. The patient has had no radiographic response to chemotherapy, but further chemotherapy in the context of severe anemia of unknown etiology is not ap propriate. Darbepoetin alfa is unlikely to be effective for the treatment of pure red cell aplasia. Transfusion of packed red blood cells would be appropriate but should be accom panied by a diagnostic plan to determine the etiology of the patient’s profound anemia."
The patient undergoes surgical resection. What factor  best predicts the patients long-term disease-free survival,A,"In multiple analyses, the completeness of resection has been found to be the only independent prognostic factor for pa tients with thymoma. WHO classification and tumor stage (as defined, in part, by capsular invasion) are prognostic factors, but they are not as predictive as completeness of surgical resection. There is no proven benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy with or without in vitro chemotherapy sen sitivity testing."
"0 g/dL Platelets 315,000/µL       Which of the following is the most appropriate next  step",B,"After initial platinum based chemotherapy, administration of octreotide in combination with prednisone is associated with a 30% response rate. In that trial, patients had to have octreotide avid tumors as determined by an octreotide scan. While the original study administered subcutaneous octre otide 3 times per day, currently available long acting forms of octreotide (e.g., octreotide acetate) are reasonable to use in this context. Continuation of current chemotherapy with or without doxorubicin is inappropriate, since the patient has had progressive disease despite this chemotherapy. Changing to carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy is inap propriate since the only supporting data for this regimen is in patients who have not had prior chemotherapy."
"5-cm anterior mediastinal mass.  There are no enlarged lymph nodes or any evidence of  pleural effusion or pleural lesions. After evaluation by a  thoracic surgeon, she undergoes radical thymectomy by a  median sternotomy. Her postoperative course is unevent - ful, and she is discharged from the hospital after 4 days.  She discontinues pyridostigmine and has no recurrence  of myasthenia symptoms. Review of the pathology report  confirms a diagnosis of thymoma, WHO type ",D,"The patient has a stage I thymoma for which no adjuvant therapy is recommended. Typically, patients are managed with intermittent CT scans for the first 2 years, with annual CT scan afterward. The rationale for surveillance imaging is the early identification of pleural based sites of recur rence that can sometimes be surgically resected. There have been no randomized clinical trials of adjuvant therapy. Nei ther cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, nor carbo platin, paclitaxel are appropriate treatments in the adjuvant setting for patients with completely resected thymoma. Ra diation therapy is typically recommended for patients with stage III thymic tumors."
"A 57-year-old Chinese male vacationing in the United  States presents to the emergency department with a nose - bleed. Nasopharyngoscopy reveals a mass in the naso - pharynx, which is biopsied, and confirms the diagnosis  of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Which virus is most  associated with nasopharyngeal cancer",B,"World Health Organization (WHO) type III, nonkeratiniz ing, undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the naso pharynx is associated with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been detected in non endemic NPC, but is not as strongly associated with NPC as EBV . The remaining choices are not associated with NPC."
"A previously healthy 47-year-old male notes right hip pain  while exercising at the gym, which persists for 2 months.  Further evaluation detects a lytic lesion of his right pelvis,  in addition to several other lesions of the spine. A biopsy of  a bone lesion reveals EBER-positive, nonkeratinizing, un - differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. What is the most  likely site of his primary cancer",C,"The WHO divides nasopharyngeal carcinoma into three histopathologic subtypes. WHO type I is keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma; WHO type II is nonkeratinizing differentiated; WHO type III is nonkeratinizing undiffer entiated squamous cell carcinoma. WHO type III is asso ciated with the Epstein Barr virus, has a more favorable prognosis, and is endemic to Southern China. EBV is de tected in cells using in situ hybridization for Epstein Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER). The other answers are incor rect because malignancies of these sites are not associated with the EBV virus."
"A previously healthy 47-year-old male notes right hip pain  while exercising at the gym, which persists for 2 months.  Further evaluation detects a lytic lesion of his right pelvis,  in addition to several other lesions of the spine. A biopsy of  a bone lesion reveals EBER-positive nonkeratinizing, undif - ferentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Nasopharyngoscopy  reveals a mass in the nasopharynx, which is biopsied, and  confirms the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Which  of the following is the most appropriate treatment option",E,"This patient has metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which is a very chemotherapy sensitive tumor, with response rates up to 80% with cisplatin based chemo therapy regimens, and occasional long term survivors. As a result, for a healthy younger patient, palliative care or hospice is not the best answer. Platinum combinations with cetuximab are appropriate for metastatic non naso pharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Immunotherapeutic agents, such as pembrolizumab, are under investigation for NPC but have not yet proven efficacious. The combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine in a phase III trial was found to be superior to cisplatin and 5 FU, with a median survival of 29 months, and is consid ered by many to be the standard of care regimen for meta static NPC."
Which of the follow - ing is the most appropriate treatment option,B,"This patient has stage I nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and should be treated with radiation alone. NPC is a very chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitive tumor, and overall survival rates of 90% have been reported for stage I disease. Surgical resection of the primary is not first line therapy because of the deep anatomical location of the nasopharynx and its proximity to critical structures. De finitive chemoradiation is the treatment of choice for most patients with stage II, III, IVa, and IVb NPC."
Which patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the head  and neck has the best prognosis,A,"Tumor p16 expression by IHC is an excellent surrogate marker for HPV positivity in oropharynx (soft palate, ton sil, base of tongue) squamous cell carcinomas. HPV asso ciated tumors account for at least 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States, and has been associated with a much better prognosis than is seen in HPV negative oro pharyngeal tumors. A retrospective analysis of the RTOG 0129 trial data was able to identify prognostic groups for oropharyngeal cancer based on p16 and smoking history. Patients with the best prognosis were those with p16 posi tive tumors and a ≤10 pack year smoking history. Oral tongue cancer is not considered an oropharyngeal tumor, and the prognostic value of p16 or HPV positivity in this tumor type is not known."
"A 56-year-old male presents to your clinic for follow-up 12  months after treatment for his T2N2c squamous cell carci - noma of the right tonsil. He was treated with concurrent  chemoradiation consisting of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 days  1, 22, and 43 of radiation. He received a total of 70 Gy of  radiation. He had a restaging PET-CT 2 days ago, which  was negative for evidence of disease. He notes worsening  fatigue over the past few months. What is the most likely  cause of his fatigue",C,"Hypothyroidism is a known complication of external beam neck irradiation and can occur in up to 50% of patients. It typically occurs at least 1 year after completion of therapy, but can occur as early as a few months following comple tion of therapy. As a result, most guidelines recommend that thyroid function is assessed via TSH levels every 6 to 12 months following completion of radiation therapy. Cisplatin can result in anemia, but 1 year after treatment, it has likely resolved. Myelodysplastic syndrome can be caused by any alkylating agent, but is much less common than hypothyroidism. Nephrotoxicity is an acute toxicity from cisplatin therapy and would not arise 1 year follow ing completion of treatment. Adrenal insufficiency can arise from hypothalamic dysfunction, but is much less likely to occur in patients radiated for tonsil cancer."
2-cm cystic cervical lymph node. An FNA  is done of the lymph node that shows p16 positive squa - mous cell carcinoma. What is the most likely site of the  primary,A,"p16 positivity by immunohistochemistry is a sensitive marker for the presence of HPV in oropharynx tumors. Oropharynx tumors arise from the base of tongue, ton sil, or soft palate. The demographic for HPV associated tumors is that of younger, male, Caucasian patients who have never smoked. They typically present with a smaller primary and more advanced neck disease than seen in HPV negative oropharynx tumors. p16 positivity can be Head and Neck Cancer 124 seen in other head and neck squamous cell carcinoma pri mary sites, but is much less frequent, and its clinical sig nificance in these tumor types is not known."
2-cm cystic cervical lymph node. An FNA  is done of the lymph node that shows p16 positive squa - mous cell carcinoma. A left sided tonsil mass is identified  on flexible laryngoscopy. PET-CT scan shows FDG-avid  matted lymph nodes in cervical regions bilaterally. There CHAPTER 16 Head and Neck Cancer Peter Hammerman and Ann GramzaHead and Neck Cancer 119 are no distant metastases. What is the best treatment op - tion for this patient,C,"The best treatment for this patient is concurrent chemo radiation with cisplatin. The presence of matted lymph nodes on the CT scan makes the probability of extranodal extension high. Extranodal extension and positive margins are the accepted indications for the addition of cisplatin to adjuvant radiation. While surgical resection of the tonsil primary with bilateral neck dissection followed by radia tion with or without chemotherapy is a potential treatment option, this patient would likely require both adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5 FU followed by surgery is also a potential option, but the patient would still require adjuvant radiation. To avoid unnecessary toxicity, most physicians recommend employing the fewest treatment modalities possible. Radiation alone is a potential treat ment option for this patient, but is typically reserved for elderly patients or those with poor performance statuses. The MACH HN meta analysis showed that definitive con current chemoradiation confers a 5 year survival benefit of 6.5% compared with radiation alone."
"A previously healthy 52-year-old Caucasian man is diag - nosed with clinical stage IVb squamous cell carcinoma  of the oral tongue that is surgically resectable. He has an  ECOG performance status of 0, excellent social support,  and normal organ function. He is referred to you for your  opinion regarding treatment of his cancer. Which is the  best treatment option for this patient",A,"This patient has oral tongue cancer, which is a tumor of the oral cavity. The oral cavity extends from the skin vermil ion junction of the lips to the junction of the hard and soft palate above and to the line of circumvallate papilla of the tongue below. The primary treatment modality for good performance status patients with locally advanced, surgically resectable disease of the oral cavity is typically surgery followed by adjuvant radiation with or without chemotherapy, de pending on the final pathology. Those patients who have positive margins or extranodal extension on final pathol ogy will require the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to radiation. Definitive chemoradiation in these patients is avoided because the dose of radiation necessary for defini tive treatment of these tumors results in significant risk of osteoradionecrosis."
"A previously healthy 52-year-old Caucasian man has under - gone surgery and reconstruction for squamous cell carcino - ma of the left anterior tongue. Final pathology was T2N2b,  with perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, and  negative margins. He has an ECOG performance status of  0, excellent social support, and normal organ function. He is  referred to you for your opinion regarding further manage - ment of his cancer. Which is the best course of management  for this patient",C,"This patient has a surgically resected oral cavity cancer, stage IVa. These patients have a high rate of recurrence and poor prognosis, so adjuvant radiation is recommend ed for most, if not all, patients with locally advanced oral cavity cancers. Factors that put patients at further high risk include extracapsular nodal spread, positive resec tion margins, N2 or N3 nodal disease, nodal disease in levels IV or V , perineural invasion, or vascular invasion. The presence of positive margins or extranodal extension on final pathology will require the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to radiation. This recommendation is made based on the pooled data of two trials, EORTC 22931 and RTOG 9501, which identified the subset of patients who will benefit most from the addition of chemotherapy. Cetuximab has not been studied in the adjuvant setting; therefore concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin is the correct answer."
"5-cm supraglottic mass, with tumor invading  the medial wall of the pyriform sinus. There was no fixa - tion of the larynx. PET-CT revealed three enlarged left  sided lymph nodes in the neck, the largest measuring 3  cm. There was no clinically overt extranodal extension  on imaging. Which of the following is the best treatment  option",D,"This patient has supraglottic larynx cancer, stage T2N2b (IVa). For a patient such as this, functional organ preserva tion should be attempted via a combination of chemother apy and radiation. This can be accomplished by concurrent chemoradiation, induction chemotherapy followed by RT alone, or sequential therapy with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Of the answers that include chemotherapy and radia tion, concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin is the best choice. The RTOG 91 11 trial established the superiority of concurrent cisplatin with radiation over induction chemo therapy with cisplatin and 5 FU followed by radiation alone for locoregional control."
A 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carci - noma of the glottis returns for follow-up 2 years after his  treatment with concurrent cisplatin and radiation. He had  a recent PET-CT with a lesion in the larynx suspicious for  recurrence. A subsequent biopsy confirms recurrent dis - ease. There are no distant metastases. What is the most ap - propriate next step in his management,C,"If possible, surgical salvage via total laryngectomy is rec ommended for patients without distant metastatic disease, as this will result in the best chance of long term survival. Palliative care and hospice would be appropriate for a pa tient who is not medically fit, has unresectable disease, or who has metastatic disease. It would also be appropriate for a patient who refuses total laryngectomy or palliative chemotherapy. Re irradiation is possible in some cases of recurrent larynx cancer. Carboplatin, 5 FU, and cetuximab is appropriate first line chemotherapy for a patient with recurrent disease who does not want to undergo laryngec tomy. Pembrolizumab or nivolumab would be appropriate for platinum refractory disease if the patient did not wish to have surgery."
Which of the following statements regarding HPV-associ - ated oropharynx cancer is not correct,C,"All of the statements regarding HPV positive tumors are correct with the exception of the statement that HPV posi tive tumors do not occur in smokers. While HPV negative oropharynx cancer is more common in smokers, smokers can still be diagnosed with HPV positive tumors. Smok ers have a poorer prognosis than nonsmokers with HPV positive oropharynx cancer."
"A 70-year-old female with a history of locally advanced  squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx is treated  with definitive concurrent chemoradiation using cisplatin.  She has a PET-CT 4 months after treatment, which reveals  a local recurrence and multiple bilateral lung metastases.  She has an excellent performance status, social support,  and normal laboratory studies. She would like to get fur - ther treatment for her cancer. Which of the following is the  next best step in her management",B,"This patient has what is considered platinum refractory disease, as she has developed recurrent disease within 6 months of treatment with definitive radiation and cispl atin. Of the choices available, nivolumab is the best treat ment option. It has FDA approval for the treatment of head and neck cancer that is platinum refractory. Retreatment with a platinum agent is more appropriate for those with recurrent disease who have had a longer disease free inter val following definitive treatment that included platinum therapy. Hospice and palliative care is an option, but not for a patient with a good performance status who wishes to receive further therapy. Total laryngectomy with metas tasectomy is rarely an option for patients with multiple lung metastases, but can be considered for those with oli gometastatic disease."
"A 55-year-old female with a history of locally advanced  squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is treated with de - finitive concurrent chemoradiation using cisplatin. She  has no evidence of disease on subsequent imaging stud - ies until 3 years later when she is found to have several  lung nodules consistent with metastatic disease. She has  an excellent performance status, social support, normal  laboratory studies, and desires the most effective treat - ment possible. Which of the following is the next best step  in her management",C,"Carboplatin or cisplatin, 5 FU, and cetuximab is an appro priate first line palliative chemotherapy regimen for pa tients who had an initial response and disease free interval after initial treatment with concurrent chemoradiation that included a platinum drug. A phase III trial demonstrated an improvement in overall survival using this regimen compared with cisplatin or carboplatin and 5 FU alone. Single agent carboplatin might be an active single agent, but combination therapy is preferred for patients with good performance status. Pembrolizumab is approved for platinum refractory disease, and in this patient’s case, it would be appropriate after failing a first line platinum combination. Hospice and palliative care are reasonable choices, but not for a patient with a good performance sta tus who wants aggressive therapy.Head and Neck Cancer 125"
"A 62-year-old Caucasian male, who has never smoked, is  diagnosed with p16 positive tonsil squamous cell carcino - ma, stage IVb. Which of the following is not an appropri - ate treatment option",B,All of these possible treatment options are appropriate with the exception of transoral robotic surgery with neck dissection followed by radiation with or without cetuxi mab. Cetuximab is not approved for the treatment of lo cally advanced head and neck cancer in the adjuvant set ting. It is an option for chemoradiation in the definitive treatment setting.
"A 55-year-old woman is diagnosed with parotid adenoid  cystic carcinoma and is treated with surgery followed  by adjuvant radiation. She was lost to follow-up. Four  years after treatment is complete, a surveillance chest CT  scan reveals a right upper lobe pulmonary nodule that is  8 mm and a left upper lobe pulmonary nodule that is 7  mm. A biopsy of a nodule confirms metastatic adenoid  cystic carcinoma. She is asymptomatic from her disease.  Head and Neck Cancer 120 What is the most appropriate management of this patient  at this time",A,"This patient was lost to follow up, and 4 years after completion of her treatment, imaging identified two small pulmonary nodules. It is likely that her disease is very indolent, and that she may survive many years without the need for systemic therapy. Systemic therapy should be given with palliative intent, as improvement in survival has not been demonstrated. Therefore of the answer choices, watchful waiting is most appropriate. Another potential treatment option is metastasectomy in select patients with limited metastases, although there is no proven survival benefit for this approach. In a patient who has rapidly growing metastases, or sig nificant symptoms, the most effective combination is cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP). Trastuzumab can be used in salivary tumors such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma that overexpress HER 2, but HER 2 is rarely overexpressed in adenoid cystic car cinoma and therefore is not an option. Vinorelbine can be used as a single agent for patients who require pallia tive therapy but will not tolerate CAP . Paclitaxel is not active in adenoid cystic carcinoma."
What is the most appropriate therapy,B,"This patient has preexisting renal insufficiency; therefore cisplatin therapy is contraindicated. Cetuximab was eval uated in a trial in which patients with locoregionally ad vanced cancers of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were randomly assigned to RT with or without concurrent weekly cetuximab. The group who were treated with ce tuximab had significantly better overall survival and local control compared with those receiving RT alone. Carbopl atin can be used with radiation, but the level of evidence is weaker than for cetuximab. Therefore cetuximab with concurrent radiation is the most appropriate therapy."
A 63-year-old female presents to your clinic with locally  advanced tonsil cancer to discuss treatment with con - current chemoradiation. You would like to treat her with  cisplatin. What is the major dose-limiting toxicity of   cisplatin,D,"According to cisplatin prescribing information, dose relat ed and cumulative renal insufficiency, including acute re nal failure, is the major dose limiting toxicity of cisplatin. Renal toxicity has been noted in 28% to 36% of patients treated with a single dose of 50 mg/m2. It is first noted during the second week after a dose and is manifested by elevations in BUN and creatinine, serum uric acid, and/ or a decrease in creatinine clearance. The other toxicities listed are also associated with cisplatin therapy and can also be severe."
"A 72-year-old male with a past history significant for alco- holism and tobacco abuse presents to his dentist complain - ing of ill-fitting dentures. His dentist discovers a floor-of- mouth mass that is biopsied and found to be squamous  cell carcinoma. In completion of his staging, he is found to  have a synchronous primary. What is the most likely loca - tion of his second primary",C,"The risk of second primary malignancy in patients who have had a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is significantly increased compared with the age matched general population. There is an up to a 10% risk of second primary in these patients. The risk is primarily for the de velopment of second primaries of the aerodigestive tract, likely related to the “field cancerization” effect of tobacco and alcohol use. Second primaries are most commonly identified in the head and neck, lung, and esophageal re gions. One series found that patients with larynx cancer were more likely to develop second primaries of the lung, whereas patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity were more likely to develop second primaries in the head and neck."
Which of the following stage I or II head and neck squa - mous cell carcinomas is least appropriate for surgical re - section as the primary treatment,E,"Early stage (I and II) head and neck squamous cell car cinomas are typically managed by either surgery or ra diation. Surgery is preferred for early stage oral cavity tumors (including lip, floor of mouth, and oral tongue) in most cases, given the risk of osteoradionecrosis from definitive radiation. Adjuvant radiation can be given if needed for high risk disease. Tumors of the larynx or hypopharynx can be managed by either definitive RT or surgery, depending on the location of the tumor and the ability to maintain functionality. Early stage nasopharynx tumors are managed by either radiation or chemoradia tion. Surgical resection of the nasopharyngeal tumor is not the primary treatment modality because of the deep anatomical location of the nasopharynx and its proximity to critical structures."
Which of the following is NOT a risk factor for the de - velopment of a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and  neck,C,Epstein Barr virus infection is associated with the devel opment of nasopharynx cancer and not squamous cell car cinoma of the head and neck.
"A 68-year-old man presents with a mass in the left neck,  which has grown progressively over the past 2 months. On  exam, a 2-cm lesion is easily appreciated and is nontender.  FNA is performed in the office and reveals squamous cell  carcinoma.    Which of the following diagnostic tests is NOT likely to be  informative in staging of his cancer",E,Brain metastases are unlikely to be identified at diagnosis in an individual with head and neck squamous cell carci noma.
"A 62-year-old woman originally from Hong Kong presents  for evaluation of swelling in the posterior right neck of 3  months duration. She also complains of mild tinnitus on  the right side. On exam, a 2-cm enlargement of at least one  posterior lymph node is noted in the right neck. FNA of  the right neck mass is performed along with a fiberoptic  exam.     What is the likely pathological process in this case",B,Nonkeratinizing nasopharynx cancer is an endemic dis ease process in Southeast Asia and is causally related to Epstein Barr virus infection.
Which of the following risk factors is associated with the  development of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and  neck,B,"Prior solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, espe cially when coupled with long term immunosuppression, increases the risk of developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma."
"A 67-year-old male is seen in a multidisciplinary clinic fol - lowing the recent diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma  of the larynx. He has well-controlled hypertension and  hypercholesterolemia, but is otherwise healthy. Clinical  staging is consistent with T3N1 staging, and the patient  expresses an interest in organ preservation if possible.  PET-CT is without evidence of distant metastases.     Which of the following treatment approaches would be  most appropriate at this point",A,Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a standard treatment approach for individuals with locally advanced larynx cancer who desire an organ sparing approach.
A 77-year-old male with diabetes and associated chronic  kidney disease and peripheral neuropathy presents for  evaluation for hoarseness. A fiberoptic exam reveals a tu - mor infiltrating both the vocal cords and the adjacent car - tilage. Imaging studies reveal no adenopathy. PET-CT is  without evidence of distant metastases.     What treatment approach would be associated with the  highest cure rate for this patient,B,"For elderly patients with significant comorbidities, which limit the ability to provide an organ sparing approach, total laryngectomy can provide the best opportunity for long term disease free survival. The extent of disease in this case makes radiotherapy alone unlikely to provide a durable benefit."
"A 54-year-old male presents with a locoregionally ad - vanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  with a tonsil primary and two enlarged lymph nodes in  the left neck. His past medical history includes hyperten - sion for which he is taking lisinopril, and he is otherwise  healthy. He is seen in a multidisciplinary clinic and ex - presses a preference for organ preservation.Head and Neck Cancer 121     Which of the following treatment approaches would be  most appropriate for this patient",C,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy provides at least equiva lent outcomes in locally advanced head and neck cancer when compared with surgery, and provides the benefit of organ preservation in appropriately selected patients."
"A 55-year-old woman is undergoing evaluation for a  newly diagnosed base-of-tongue squamous cell carcinoma  with metastases to bilateral anterior cervical lymph nodes.  She has been evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic, and  treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been  recommended.     Which of the following toxicities would NOT be associated  with this approach",A,"Otalgia is not commonly reported as a side effect in indi viduals undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. It should be not ed that such treatment is associated with significant toxici ties, and that aggressive management to provide support is essential to avoid interruptions in therapy and to im prove the patient’s quality of life.Head and Neck Cancer 126"
"A 58-year-old male is seen for evaluation of a new diag - nosis of a squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx  with bilateral anterior cervical adenopathy observed both  clinically and by neck CT. Multidisciplinary evaluation is  undertaken, and a recommendation is offered for induc - tion chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy or  chemoradiotherapy alone.     Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiother - apy is associated with which of the following in locally  advanced head and neck cancer therapy compared with  chemoradiotherapy alone",E,"Approaches using induction chemotherapy have been compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone for the treatment of locally advanced HNSCC. These studies have, in aggregate, not suggested an improvement in treat ment outcome with this approach despite a reduction in the rate of distant metastases following definitive therapy."
A 57-year-old woman with locally advanced squamous  cell carcinoma of the tonsil with concurrent metastasis to  a left anterior cervical lymph node is preparing to begin  concurrent chemoradiotherapy for definitive treatment  of her disease. Her medical history is significant only for  postmenopausal bleeding for which she underwent hys - terectomy and for well-controlled hypertension.     Which of the following chemotherapy regimens would be  most appropriate in this case to accompany radiotherapy,D,"While it can be associated with significant toxicity, bolus cisplatin administered at 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks during radiotherapy is the best supported chemotherapy regimen for concurrent chemoradiation in a patient with a good performance status. While other cisplatin regimens have been studied, direct comparisons to a higher dose are lack ing. Carboplatin is typically reserved in cases in which an individual cannot tolerate cisplatin."
0 cm. PET-CT is negative  for distant disease. She has no other major medical prob - lems.     What would be the most appropriate definitive treatment  option,B,"Locally advanced cancers of the oral cavity are often highly aggressive in their biology and require multidisciplinary management. For individuals with good performance sta tus, this would combine surgical resection with appropri ate adjuvant therapy."

What pathologic feature(s) would portend a higher rate of  disease recurrence and suggest a greater degree of benefit  from the addition of chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting in  an individual with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,C,Extracapsular lymph node extension as well as lympho vascular and perineural invasion are associated with poor er prognosis following surgery in resected HNSCC.
A 52-year-old woman presents for medical attention with  a complaint of nasal discharge. Fiberoptic examination re - veals a mass in the nasopharynx without parapharyngeal  extension. Biopsy of the lesion is performed and is notable  for nonkeratinizing carcinoma. Additional imaging stud - ies are performed and do not identify other sites of disease.     What is the most appropriate treatment option for this pa - tient,D,In an individual with early stage nasopharynx cancer (T1 in this case) radiotherapy alone is associated with a high rate of cure greater than 90% and less morbidity than many other approaches.
"A 56-year-old male is undergoing evaluation for bilateral  posterior cervical adenopathy. Endoscopic examination  and imaging studies are consistent with a primary carcino - ma of the nasopharynx with bilateral lymph node metasta - ses, and this is confirmed by fine needle aspiration. There  is no evidence of distant disease. The patient is otherwise  well and without significant symptoms.     Which of the following represents a standard treatment for  locally advanced nasopharynx cancer",E,Concurrent chemoradiotherapy remains the standard of care for locally advanced nasopharynx cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy following chemoradiotherapy may be ben eficial in some cases and has been extensively evaluated with mixed results.
"A 58-year-old male presents for routine evaluation 1 year  after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced squamous  cell carcinoma of the larynx. He reports that he has expe - rienced some fatigue and cough recently, but is otherwise  well. He is taking lisinopril for hypertension and simvas - tatin for elevated cholesterol. CT imaging of the chest with  contrast indicates numerous pulmonary nodules not seen  on a chest CT performed 3 months previously, as well as a  new mass in the larynx adjacent to the radiation field.     What is an appropriate first-line treatment for recurrent/ metastatic carcinoma of the larynx",A,Cisplatin plus 5 FU is an active and well established treat ment regimen for initial treatment of metastatic HNSCC. Recent data from the EXTREME study have indicated fur ther benefit with the addition of cetuximab.
"5 cm. PET-CT demonstrates  avidity in this nodule, but no other concerning sites are  noted. Fiberoptic exam confirms disease-free status at the  treated site.     What is the appropriate next step in treatment for this  patient",A,"For individuals with oligometastatic HNSCC, long term survival can be achieved with aggressive management of metastases. Surgical resection of the solitary lung nodule is appropriate in this case."
"A 53-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of  progressive swelling in her left parotid gland. Her medi - cal history is otherwise unremarkable. On physical exam,  a 1 to 2 cm mass associated with the left parotid gland is  noted, and CT of the neck confirms this finding. There is  no adenopathy on exam.     What is the most likely pathologic process in this case",A,"Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common parotid tu mor and can typically be cured with excision. Some pleo morphic adenomas can recur following surgery, and the potential does exist for malignant transformation."
A 59-year-old woman is seen in the office 1 year following  surgical resection of a salivary duct carcinoma. She reports  that she has noted some swelling in her neck as well as pain  in her cervical spine. Imaging studies are performed and  demonstrate cervical lymph node and spinal metastases.

"A 58-year-old woman is undergoing treatment with van - detanib for metastatic medullary carcinoma of the thy - roid. She reports feeling well on therapy at her first visit, 2  weeks after initiation, and is without diarrhea, fatigue, or  cutaneous toxicity.     What test should be ordered at this visit given the safety  profile of vandetanib",A,"Vandetanib therapy has been associated with QTc prolon gation, and baseline and on treatment ECGs should be ob tained as safety measures."
"A 77-year-old male presents with a rapidly progressive  neck mass with associated local discomfort and dyspha - gia. On exam, a bulky mass extended from the thyroid  gland is appreciated. Biopsy of the mass reveals anaplastic  thyroid cancer, and imaging studies (PET/CT) are without  evidence of disease outside the thyroid.     What is the most appropriate management for organ con - fined anaplastic thyroid cancer",C,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer, when organ confined, is amena ble to combined modality treatment, and such treatment can provide a survival benefit to patients. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients have a complete resection of anaplastic thyroid cancer."

"A 59-year-old woman presents with progressive solid food  dysphagia and weight loss. She is found to have micro - cytic anemia. Endoscopy reveals a friable, partially ob - structing mass in the GE junction, and a biopsy indicates  well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. A CT scan of the chest  and abdomen shows left supraclavicular and mediastinal  adenopathy and multiple hepatic metastases. Additional  testing prior to initiating therapy should include:  ",C,"The patient has clear metastatic disease, so PET scan imag ing will not contribute to staging. CNS imaging is not rou tinely done in these patients unless there are neurologic symptoms. RAS and EGFr mutations are rare and have no impact on currently available therapies. HER2 is targetable by trastuzumab, and in the landmark TOGA trial, adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy in HER2 positive patients improved all outcomes including survival. All patients with metastatic disease should be tested for HER2 to de termine eligibility for treatment with trastuzumab."
"His  biopsy tested IHC 1+ for HER2, and FISH testing showed  no gene amplification. FOLFOX chemotherapy is planned. You advise the patient of which of the following",C,"IHC 1+ is deemed negative expression for HER2, and some question the utility of FISH testing in this situation and re serve FISH testing only for equivocal HER2 staining that is 2+; 3+ staining is considered positive. Trastuzumab does not increase cardiotoxicity when given with fluorinated py rimidine/platinum–based chemotherapy.

A CT  and PET scan show no evidence of metastatic disease. He  undergoes a staging laparoscopy, which grossly appears  normal, but three peritoneal washings indicate a positive  cytology for adenocarcinoma. What is the next step in the  patient’s management",C,"A positive cytology escalates the stage to stage IV , and such patients have poor short term outcomes with upfront surgery and should be approached and treated as meta static disease."
You proceed with  therapy to include:  ,A,"The patient is elderly with significant medical comor bidities and is not likely a surgical candidate for es ophagectomy. That being said, he may be a candidate for primary chemoradiotherapy without surgery. The recent CROSS trial validated weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel, combined with radiotherapy as an active combined modality therapy regimen, with a tolerance and pathologic complete response rate in esophageal squamous cancer that was superior to results reported with older chemoradiotherapy regimens. This would be preferred over a cisplatin based combination, given the patient’s age and renal function. Randomized trials have suggested improvement in local tumor control, without a clear cut improvement in survival for adding surgery to upfront chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cancer."

Your choice of  chemotherapy to treat this patient is:  ,A,"The optimal therapy in this patient is FOLFOX. ELF is a regimen combining etoposide, leucovorin, and bolus 5 FU and has severe toxicity, limited efficacy, and is no longer in use. Although EOX and DCF are options, the patient is 75 with medical comorbidities and congestive heart failure and unlikely to tolerate a triplet regimen, and avoidance of an anthracycline is advisable. Recent studies have ques tioned whether adding epirubicin to two drug chemother apy offers any benefit, and studies in patients over the age of 65 have not shown a survival benefit for adding a taxane to a fluoropyrimidine/platinum doublet. In a patient with adequate functional status, combination chemotherapy is preferred over monotherapy."
"A 59-year-old woman has undergone surveillance endos - copy every 2 years over the past decade for a short segment  of Barrett’s esophagus. She has no medical comorbidities  and now presents with a follow-up endoscopy, which  shows a persistent short segment of Barrett esophagus. On  four-quadrant biopsy analysis, she is found to have evi - dence of high-grade dysplasia on multiple biopsies, but no  evidence of cancer. The optimal therapy in this patient is  which of the following",D,"Recent studies suggest that RFA is an acceptable, non surgical alternative for the initial treatment of dysplastic Barrett esophagus. Morbidity and mortality are clearly lower than as well as less invasive than surgery. Photo dynamic therapy has been replaced by RFA.

"A biopsy of the mass reveals a poorly differen - tiated, high-grade neuroendocrine tumor. You meet with  the patient to discuss therapy options, and you advise him  to do which of the following",D,"Extrapulmonary small cell high grade neuroendocrine tumors are treated similar to small cell lung cancer. For limited stage disease that can be encompassed in a radio therapy field, concurrent etoposide/platinum radiation therapy is a reasonable treatment option, even without surgery, given the high rate of systemic recurrence in this histology. Several case series indicate long term survival in such patients treated with primary chemoradiotherapy."
"A 40-year-old advertising executive with longstanding  esophageal reflux and a history of short segment Bar - rett esophagus is found on follow-up endoscopy to have persistent Barrett esophagus with no dysplasia, but on  biopsy there is a focus of invasive adenocarcinoma. En - doscopy otherwise shows esophagitis with no frank es - ophageal mass. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen is  normal. Endoscopy with ultrasound suggests a possible  small T1 lesion, with no evidence of regional adenopathy.  The patient has no medical comorbidities. He asks about  the optimal next step in therapy. Which therapy do you  recommend",D,"For a superficial T1 esophageal cancer, an attempt at endo scopic mucosal resection should be made. For T1a lesions that rate of positivity for lymph nodes is less than 3%–5%. There is controversy about more deeply penetrating T1b lesions, which may have higher rates of nodal involve ment."
"A 65-year-old man with non-insulin-dependent diabetes  and hypertension has been treated for a GEJ adenocarci - noma with hepatic metastases and lung metastases. His  tumor tested HER2 negative, and he had a protracted re - sponse over 8 months to capecitabine and cisplatin and  now has disease progression in the lung and liver. ECOG  functional status is 1, and he has normal organ function.  He asks about the next choice of chemotherapy. What do  you recommend to the patient",B,"After disease progression on fluorinated pyrimidine/ platinum–based chemotherapy, the combination of the VEGFR2 inhibitor ramucirumab added to second line pa clitaxel was superior to paclitaxel alone, with improved PFS, OS, and response rate. FOLFIRI has limited second line activity from phase II data, and gefitinib failed to im prove survival compared to placebo in a phase 3 trial."
You   refer the patient and family for genetic counseling. The  most likely finding on genetic testing will be:  ,D,"The patient’s family history is concerning for Lynch syn drome. The hallmark cancers, colon and uterine cancer, were present in two blood relatives at a young age, and Lynch syndrome can also be associated with pancreatic cancer and esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Although gastric cancer can be seen in families with BRCA mutation, gastric cancer occurs much less frequently in these fami lies. The family history is not suggestive of familial adeno matous polyposis, which is caused by APC gene mutation."
You advise the patient that his next chemo - therapy regimen should consist of which of the following,C,"TDM 1, the conjugate agent combining trastuzumab with and antimicrotubule agent, failed to improve outcome com pared with conventional second line paclitaxel in a recent phase III trial. Paclitaxel plus ramucirumab is the standard of care in second line therapy, irrespective of HER2 status. There is no evidence that continuing trastuzumab into sec ond line chemotherapy improves outcome. There are no data supporting the addition of epirubicin to fluorinated pyrimi dine/platinum–based chemotherapy at disease progression."
"A 55-year-old lawyer was recently diagnosed with es - ophageal adenocarcinoma with metastatic disease to lung,  mediastinum, and abdominal lymph nodes. His tumor  tested HER2 negative. He has had commercial testing for  genomic mutations and was told that his tumor had a p53  mutation as well as amplification of the MET receptor  and the EGFr receptor. He is interested in pursuing novel Esophageal Cancer 130 therapies. You advise him that his chemotherapy regimen  should include:  ",C,"Recent phase III trials failed to indicate a benefit for MET targeted agents combined with chemotherapy, and nega tive results were also reported for EGFr targeted agents combined with chemotherapy. Bevacizumab failed to im prove survival added to first line chemotherapy on the AVAGAST trial. Chemotherapy alone is the appropriate choice."
The most appropriate manage - ment in this patient is which of the following,D,"Although up front esophagectomy followed by postop erative chemoradiotherapy is an option, validated by US INT 116 using 5 FU and radiotherapy postoperatively, high rates of positive margins occur with upfront surgery, and the radiation field after esophagectomy is quite large. A follow up trial to INT116 was CALGB 80101, which indi cated no benefit beyond 5 FU alone for the adjuvant chem otherapy component, so that the inclusion of cisplatin with postoperative chemoradiotherapy post op would not be recommended. Preoperative radiation therapy has no proven role, and HER2 status does not impact on chemo therapy choice, as trastuzumab is only used in HER2 posi tive metastatic esophagogastric cancer. Use of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiotherapy as a preoperative standard was established by the Dutch CROSS trial, which indi cated R0 resection and survival benefits for this approach compared with surgery alone.

Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is linked to the following:  ,D,"Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by a germline mutation in one of several DNA MMR genes or loss of expression of MSH2 due to deletion in the EPCAM gene. Germline mutation in the STK11 gene is as sociated with Peutz Jeghers syndrome. Germline mutations in PTEN are found in many patients with Cowden syn drome. Mutations in the E cadherin (CDH1) gene mutation leads to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. It is a germline mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The cumulative risk for advanced diffuse type gastric cancer is higher in males than females with E cadherin (CDH1) mu tation, 70% and 56%, respectively. An increased risk of gas tric cancer has been reported in BRCA2 mutation, but it is not associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer."

Biopsy is positive for intestinal  type adenocarcinoma. Staging CT shows multiple liver hy - podense lesions and multiple lung nodules involving both  lungs. Which of the following would impact the first-line  treatment management of this patient",C,"Based on the findings of the staging CT scans, the patient has stage IV disease, and obtaining a PET CT scan will not change the patient’s management. The EGD biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, and the ra diologic findings were consistent with stage IV disease, and liver or lung biopsies are not warranted. Knowing the HER2 status of this patient would impact the first line CHAPTER 18 Gastric Cancer Caio Max Rocha LimaGastric Cancer 134 therapy choice. The ToGA trial showed that the addition of trastuzumab to cisplatinum and fluoropyrimidine chemo therapy improved survival in HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer patients. In this trial HER2 positive was defined as “+++” via IHC or “+” via FISH. KRAS muta tion analysis is a predictor of EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment in colon cancer, but not in gastric cancer. Check point inhibitors are promising agents in gastric cancer, and PDL 1 expression may become a relevant biomarker in the first line treatment selection in the future, but at this time it does not impact on the choice for first line therapy in gastric cancer."
"All target agents listed below led to improvement in sur - vival in metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, except:  ",A,"Anti EGFR therapies in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer resulted in no improvement in survival in both the REAL 3 and the EXPAND studies. Both studies failed to demonstrate a sur vival advantage with either cetuximab or panitumumab in unselected patient populations. The REGARD trial showed that ramucirumab was superior to BSC as second line therapy in metastatic gastric cancer, OS of 5.2 months ver sus 3.8 months (HR = 0.776, 95% CI, 0.603–0.998, P = .047). Apatinib was superior to BSC (6.5 months; 95% CI, 4.8–7.6 vs. 4.7 months; 95% CI, 3.6–5.4; P = .0149) in a randomized study that enrolled 267 patients who were previously treated with at least two lines of therapy.

A 65-year-old male with progressive dysphagia and  15-pound weight loss in the past month. EGD shows a  GE junction mass extending 3 cm into the cardia. Biop - sy is positive for moderately differentiated adenocarci - noma. EUS is positive for a T3N1 tumor. Staging scans  showed no evidence of distant metastatic disease. You  chose perioperative chemotherapy (neoadjuvant therapy  followed by surgery followed by adjuvant therapy) as  your treatment of choice. Which of the following state - ment is not true,C,"This patient has T3N1 GEJ adenocarcinoma. Perioperative chemotherapy was superior to surgery alone in the MAGIC and FFCD/ACCORD trials. On the MAGIC trial, three cy cles of ECF, followed by surgery, followed by 3 cycles of ECF were superior to surgery alone. On the FFCD/AC CORD trial, up to 3 cycles of CF before and after surgery were superior to surgery alone. Both trials led to improve ment in resection rates and improvement in 5 year survival rates. On the FFCD/ACCORD trial, most patients had GEJ adenocarcinoma, and the HR was 0.57 in this population. In the MAGIC trial, a minority of patients had GE junction adenocarcinoma, and in this population the HR was 0.49. The MRC OE05 trial randomized patients with resectable (T1NO and T2N0 tumors excluded) distal esophageal and GEJ adenocarcinomas to either two cycles of preoperative CF or four cycles of preoperative ECX. Overall survival was not statistically different between the two arms, and perioperative ECX was more toxic. The FLOT4 randomized phase III study comparing eight cycles of perioperative FLOT (docetaxel, 5FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) to six cycles of perioperative ECF/ECX (5FU or capecitabine in combination with cisplatin and epirubicin) in adenocarci noma of the stomach or GEJ showed pathologic complete response rates of 12.8% versus 5.1%, respectively ( P = .015). Similarly to metastatic disease, adding panitumumab to ECX did not improve outcomes in locally advanced gas troesophageal adenocarcinomas."
Sixty-five-year-old male transferred to your care with a  history of gastric adenocarcinoma posttotal gastrectomy 8  years ago. Which of the following deficiencies would you  be concerned about,E,"Total gastrectomy will result in intrinsic factor deficiency and malabsorption of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) that will lead to pernicious anemia. The median time to cobalamin deficiency is about 15 months after total gastrectomy. Iron malabsorption and deficiency postgastrectomy may result from achlorhydria, gastric dumping, or afferent (blind) loop syndromes with or without bacterial overgrowth.

Which of the following has not demonstrated a survival  benefit as compared with the standard of care for patients  with metastatic pancreatic cancer,C,"FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab paclitaxel have both been shown to improve overall (and progression free) survival as compared with gemcitabine alone. Gemcitabine was demonstrated to improve survival over the prior standard of care (5 fluorouracil) at that time. Gemcitabine, docetaxel (T), and capecitabine (X) (GTX) has never been tested against the standard of care in a phase III trial. Thus the correct answer is C."

On the basis of numerous retrospective studies showing a lack of benefit in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring NRAS mutations. Single agent beva cizumab is unlikely to show benefit in this patient, and surgical resection is not recommended in patients with widely distributed metastatic disease unless for palliative benefit."
"Tumor is found to have a KRAS muta - tion G12V , BRAF wild-type, PIK3CA wild-type, and is also  microsatellite-stable (MSS). What is the next appropriate  step in management",B,"This patient presents with stage II colon adenocarcinoma without high risk features. High risk factors for recur rence include poorly differentiated histology (exclusive of MSI H), lymphatic/vascular invasion, bowel obstruc tion, less than 12 lymph nodes examined, PNI, localized perforation, or positive margins.

Which of  the following is true with regard to BRAF V600E mutated  colorectal cancer",C,"BRAF mutations are rarely seen in combination with RAS mutations; the two are thought to be mutually exclusive. BRAF mutant colorectal cancer is associ ated with a poorer prognosis and disease free survival. These mutations are more frequently seen in older pa tients, women, and with right sided colorectal cancer, but BRAF mutations are still found in only 5% to 10% of the patient population. Single agent vemurafenib has not been shown to be effective in BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer."
He is found to be HIV-negative. What is the next  appropriate management step for this patient,A,"Initiation of chemoradiation with concurrent 5 FU and mitomycin is the appropriate treatment for this patient.

She  is currently receiving no treatment for her rash. What is the  next appropriate step in management,B,"Development of an acneiform (papulopustular) rash is a common cutaneous adverse reaction to EGFR inhibitors. Appropriate management of a grade 2 rash would include topical corticosteroids and oral antibiotics with or without topical corticosteroids. These interventions should be at tempted prior to a change in either dose, frequency, or a change in the regimen. Treatment of a grade 2 rash with low potency topical steroids alone will be unlikely to re solve the symptoms."
Molecular testing reveals a KRAS G13D mutation.  What should be the next step in management,C,"As demonstrated in the German Rectal Cancer Study, the benefits of neoadjuvant as compared with adjuvant chem oradiotherapy include a superior sphincter preservation rate, a lower rate of anastomotic stenosis as a long term complication of pelvic RT, and better local control while providing similar long term survival. Therefore this is the recommended approach for a patient with T3 or higher disease or node positive rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant FOL FOX in combination with cetuximab is not a recommend ed regimen for preoperative therapy in cases of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma."
The most appropriate management of her hypertension is:  ,C,"Hypertension is a common side effect of bevacizumab. The hypertension is typically managed with antihypertensive medication with good success. Given the survival benefit of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer, it is preferable to treat the side effect and proceed with therapy.

Patient underwent  hemicolectomy 6 weeks earlier, when pathology revealed  tumor penetrating through the muscularis propria, 5 of  27 lymph nodes positive for disease; lymphovascular and  perineural invasion were present (pT3N2aM0). The tumor  was found to be microsatellite-high (MSI-high) with loss  of MSH2 noted by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Molecu - lar testing reveals no mutations in RAS, but a BRAF V600E  mutation is present. The patient has recovered well from  surgery and is interested in the next steps for treatment. In  addition to referral for genetic counseling, what is the best  recommendation for this patient at this time",B,"This patient has stage IIIB colorectal cancer; thus the rec ommendation in a healthy adult would be to treat with adjuvant FOLFOX for 6 months. Although the patient is MSI high because he has positive lymph nodes and stage III disease, the recommendation would be to proceed with chemotherapy as opposed to active surveillance. Irinote can should not be given in the adjuvant setting owing to the lack of benefit. Pembrolizumab has no indication in the adjuvant setting, though clinical trials are investigating the potential benefit in patients with MSI high colon cancer.

She is subsequently treated  with TAS-102 but again has progression of disease on her  first restaging study. Her ECOG performance status is 1,  and she wants further treatment. Which of the following is  the best treatment recommendation at this time",A,"Given that the patient has a good performance status and is motivated to continue treatment, referral for a clinical trial is the best option at this time. Given that the patient’s tumor harbors a NRAS mutation, she is unlikely to benefit from EGFR directed therapy. She has already had progres sion on capecitabine and bevacizumab and is unlikely to have a response. Surgical resection can sometimes be uti lized in oligometastatic disease, but that is not indicated at this time."
Which of the following alterations is most suggestive of  sporadic microsatellite instability high (MSI-high) colorec - tal cancer,D,"Colorectal cancer that demonstrates microsatellite insta bility (MSI) is caused by either germline mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations, or “sporadic” somatic tumor MLH1 promoter methylation, which is correlated with tu mor BRAF V600E mutation status. Alterations in MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM are suggestive of a germline MMR. KRAS, PIK3CA, and TP53 alterations are not sug gestive of MSI."
What is the  next best step for management of this patient,B,"This patient presents with refractory metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. 5 FU and cisplatin is the only current recommended therapy for metastatic anal cancer. Given this patient’s refractory disease, referral for clinical trial is the appropriate step at this point. Cetuxi mab is not approved for metastatic anal cancer. 5 FU with mitomycin is unlikely to be effective in this setting. Pal liative radiation is not recommended at this time given that not all target lesions can be treated. Capecitabine and temozolomide are not approved for the treatment of meta static anal cancer."
What is the next appropriate step for this patient,D,"The patient’s tumor was initially sent for KRAS exon 2 testing only. However, current guidelines recommend testing for additional exons in KRAS (3 and 4) as well as NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4, since mutations in these genes confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Radiation therapy to the liver and lungs may add limited benefit with un acceptable toxicity. FOLFOX and bevacizumab would be expected to have a low response rate given the patient’s prior treatment history."
A 70-year-old female is diagnosed with stage IV colon can - cer with metastases to the liver and pelvic bones. Biopsy  demonstrates no mutations in RAS or RAF.

A painful red palmar rash devel - ops after 2 weeks of therapy. This was scored as a grade 1  reaction. Which of the following is the best treatment rec - ommendation at this time,E,"Hand foot skin reaction is a common side effect of re gorafenib therapy. If grade 1 hand foot skin reaction is noted, regorafenib can be continued with good supportive care, including avoiding hot water, using moisturizing lo tion, and wearing cotton gloves and socks at night. Grade 2 reactions can be managed by reducing the dose by 50% and giving supportive care, including the use of a moistur izing cream, clobetasol ointment twice daily, and topical analgesics. If a grade 3 reaction is noted, dosing should be interrupted and supportive care given."

What is the  next best step for management",A,"This patient has been diagnosed with a well differentiated, low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the rectum with liver metastases. This appears to be a nonfunctioning tu mor with no history of flushing or diarrhea. In this scenar io, lanreotide has been shown to improve PFS, as shown in the CLARINET trial. FOLFOX and bevacizumab would be a reasonable regimen for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Suni tinib is approved for pancreatic neuroendocrine carcino ma. Capecitabine with temozolomide has unclear benefit in this patient population, and initiation of chemoradia tion with concurrent capecitabine would be reasonable if the patient had colorectal adenocarcinoma with only lo coregional disease.Colorectal and Anal Cancer 147"
Which of the following genes is associated with familial  adenomatous polyposis (FAP),E,"FAP accounts for less than 1% of all colorectal cancers and can lead to multiple polyps in the colon and rectum. Muta tions in the APC gene causes FAP , and most patients have a family history of the condition. Mutations in the MYH gene causes MYH associated polyposis, marked by multi ple precancerous polyps in the colon and rectum, similar in number to those seen in a milder form of FAP . MLH1 and MSH6 are associated with Lynch syndrome."
9 cm focus of well-differentiated carcinoid tumor with - out evidence of lymphovascular or mesoappendiceal inva - sion. The patient has recovered well from surgery. What is  the next best appropriate step for management,B,"Per NCCN guidelines, patients with appendiceal carci noid tumors less than 2 cm do not require routine sur veillance, and tests should be ordered only as clinically indicated. For tumors greater than 2 cm, a history and physical is recommended between 3 and 12 months after re section as well as consideration of tumor markers (5 HIAA, chromogranin) and abdominal imaging. After the first year, a history and physical and consideration of tumor markers is recommended every 6 to 12 months. FOLFOX chemo therapy is typically used for adjuvant therapy for colorectal adenocarcinomas. Surgical debulking and HIPEC is a strat egy that is sometimes used for metastatic carcinoid tumors."
"A 71-year-old male presents for his second infusion of iri - notecan and cetuximab for second-line treatment of RAS  wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer following progres - sion on FOLFOX and bevacizumab. During his first infu - sion 2 weeks earlier, 2 hours after the administration of  irinotecan, he experienced diarrhea, emesis, diaphoresis,  and abdominal cramping, which resolved approximately 4  hours later. The patient is nervous about being treated given  his prior experience with the infusion. What is the next best  step for managing the patient’s symptoms",C,"This patient is experiencing irinotecan induced cholinergic hyperstimulation syndrome. The action is mediated by in hibition of acetylcholinesterase and by direct binding to and stimulation of muscarinic receptors. Symptoms can be inhib ited by administration of atropine. Patients homozygous for UGT1A1*28 are at elevated risk of neutropenia. The symp toms described by the patient do not fit the scenario typically seen with cetuximab infusion reactions. DPD deficiency can cause severe neutropenia, mucositis, and diarrhea in patients treated with 5 FU or capecitabine, but DPD deficiency has not been associated with increased toxicity to irinotecan."
"A 42-year-old HIV-positive male presents to clinic with re - ports of occasional anal bleeding. Anoscopy reveals an anal  margin lesion, and biopsy shows a well-differentiated squa - mous cell carcinoma. CT of the chest and abdomen reveals  no evidence of distant metastatic disease. Pelvic MRI points  to a small mass in the anal canal with no evidence of lym - phadenopathy. He is staged cT1N0M0 and undergoes sur - gical resection of the lesion, revealing pT1 disease. Surgical  margins are clear, and all margins are noted to be greater  than 1 cm. What is the next best step for management",A,"Anal margin lesions (defined as the area at the anal verge including the perianal skin over a 5 to 6 cm radius from the squamous mucocutaneous junction) can be treated with either local excision or chemoradiation depending on the clinical stage. Primary treatment for patients with T1, N0 well differentiated anal margin cancers is by local exci sion with adequate margins, defined as margins of 1 cm or greater. If margins are not adequate, reexcision is the pre ferred treatment option. Local radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can be considered as an alternative treatment option when surgical margins are inadequate."
"A 53-year-old female with KRAS-mutated metastatic colo - rectal cancer (G13D) received 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with  bevacizumab. She was then treated with maintenance  capecitabine and bevacizumab. Four months after ini - tiating maintenance therapy, she is found on CT to have  progression of disease with enlarging liver metastases.  She has no peripheral neuropathy. What treatment option  would not be recommended at this time",D,"For this patient receiving maintenance chemotherapy with progression, a return to FOLFOX/bevacizumab would be reasonable presuming that she has grade 1 or less pe ripheral neuropathy. FOLFIRI in combination with beva cizumab, ziv aflibercept, and ramucirumab would all be reasonable second line options, given data from the TML, VELOUR, and RAISE studies respectively. Although ret rospective data have shown the possibility of benefit of cetuximab in patients with G13D KRAS mutations, pro spective studies have failed to show an improvement in this patient population. Therefore FOLFIRI/cetuximab would not be recommended for this patient."
"She is referred for a colonoscopy to  evaluate her iron-deficiency anemia. A right-sided colonic  mass is found, which shows to be a moderately differenti - ated adenocarcinoma. She has a laparoscopic right hemi - colectomy and is found to have a T3N1 colon cancer with  1/16 LN+. She is referred to oncology for adjuvant recom - mendations. You recommend:  ",B,"The standard of care therapy for patients with stage III colon cancer, defined as lymph node–positive dis ease without metastatic disease, is oxaliplatin plus 5 FU. However, in patients with a contraindication to oxalipl atin—for example, in this patient with existing neuropa thy—studies have reported that 5 FU–based therapy alone may be used as an alternative. In particular, the X ACT study randomized 1987 patients with resected stage III disease to capecitabine versus bolus 5 FU. The patient population that received capecitabine had equivalent 3 year disease free survival in overall survival. Disease free survival was 64% versus 61% with a P = .5, and overall survival was 81% ver sus 78% with a P = .07 favoring capecitabine."
He is re - ferred to oncology for adjuvant therapy recommendations.  You recommend:  ,D,"This patient has low risk stage II colon cancer. His can cer is well differentiated, he has an adequate lymph node dissection with 25 lymph nodes examined, and he has no lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Accordingly this patient would not be offered adjuvant chemotherapy. He should still receive surveillance for his colon cancer with physical exam, blood work including tumor marker CEA, and imaging."
He is referred to oncology for adjuvant  therapy recommendations. You recommend:  ,E,"This patient had a stage II colon cancer with lymphovas cular and perineural invasion. Although these are consid ered as higher risk features, the fact that the patient has mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability puts the patient in an excellent prognostic category. Because of their excellent prognosis, patients with stage II disease that have deficient mismatch repair should not be offered adju vant chemotherapy."
3 and is normalizes postoperatively. What do you recom - mend as the next step for his cancer care,A,"The patient has stage III disease as defined by lymph node involvement. He also has lymphovascular and perineural invasion, but his adjuvant chemotherapy is determined by his node positivity, which makes him a stage III cancer patient. Standard of care adjuvant therapy is 5 FU and oxaliplatin. The standard of care is based on two major clinical trials, the MOSAIC study and the NSABP C 07 trial. Both showed an improve ment in disease free survival, and the MOSAIC study also showed an improvement in overall survival in long term follow up for stage III cancer patients. Capecitabine with oxaliplatin is also a reasonable adjuvant therapy regimen."
"A 30-year old female presents with an 18-month history  of bleeding with bowel movements that began during  her first pregnancy. At that time she was diagnosed with  hemorrhoids, but the rectal bleeding has persisted. She is  found to have a rectal mass 8 cm from the verge that is  biopsied and found to be adenocarcinoma. Full staging  workup reveals a clinically staged T3N1 rectal cancer. The  patient reports that she is still interested in having more  children. Which of the following is not a true statement  when you are counseling her",B,"Preservation of fertility is an important issue to discuss for the patients who are still in their childbearing years and who have stage II or III rectal cancer requiring chemora diation to help prevent local or regional recurrence. For women, the radiation port will likely cover the uterus as well as the ovaries, which can create a permanently in hospitable environment for carrying a pregnancy to term. Radiation to the ovaries can also cause ovarian failure in a high proportion of patients. Strategies to preserve fertility include surgically moving the ovaries as well as harvest ing oocytes, which may be more viable if they are ferti lized."
"A 53-year old man presents with perirectal pain and stool  caliber changes, with now 10 days of significant tenesmus  with abdominal cramping at each attempt of defecation.  On colonoscopy he is found to have an almost completely  obstructing rectal mass at 10 cm from the anal verge. Clini - cal and radiological staging reveals no distant metastases  with T3N1 disease. Which of the following is not an accept - able management strategy at this time",D,"The patient has an obstructing rectal mass that is very likely to cause a bowel obstruction in the near future. A diverting colostomy followed by definitive treatment is a reasonable and safe plan for the care of this patient. If the patient is be ing cared for in a center where chemotherapy or radiation can be started very quickly, he could be started on chemo radiation or chemotherapy within the next few days, since Colorectal and Anal Cancer 148 to most patients have a rapid improvement in symptoms as soon as treatment with either of these modalities begins. It would not be safe to wait 2 to 3 weeks before beginning chemotherapy or chemoradiation; emergent surgery for bowel obstruction has much greater morbidity than elec tive correction of the obstruction."
"A 64-year-old female presents for her screening colonos - copy and is found to have a rectal mass 3 cm from the anal  verge. Biopsy returns as moderately differentiated adeno - carcinoma. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis re - veals no distant metastases. Which of the following should  be used to stage her T and N status",E,"Appropriate staging of the T and N status of rectal cancer patients is particularly important, because if such a patient has a response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation, the surgi cal staging is likely to understage him or her. CT scans do not provide enough pelvic visibility to properly stage rec tal cancer patients. FDG PET scans can be used to evaluate for distant disease, but also do not have enough resolution to evaluate for nodal disease; in addition, not all rectal can cer patients will have PET avid tumors. Either an MRI of the pelvis or an endoscopic ultrasound can be utilized to properly stage the T and N status of rectal cancer patients, with the caveat that endoscopic ultrasound is best used in clinical centers or with physicians with significant experi ence in using it for cancer staging."
"3 g/dL; on physical exam, he has a firm, palpable mass  3 cm from the anal verge. After referral to a gastroenter - ologist, the patient has a colonoscopy, which confirms the  location of the mass; on biopsy it is found to be a rectal  adenocarcinoma. MRI of the pelvis shows a T4N0 tumor  with involvement of the internal anal sphincter. Which of  the following is not accurate in terms of initial counseling  about his disease",E,"The creation of a colostomy, either temporary or perma nent, is a major psychological issue for patients undergo ing treatment for rectal cancer. Involvement of the inter nal anal sphincter often requires the patient to have an abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy formation. However, even the patient with internal anal sphincter involvement may be able to have a permanent colostomy sparing surgery if he or she has an excellent re sponse to chemoradiation. Best practice is to acknowledge the real risk of a possible colostomy, but the patient should be advised that these questions will be better answered af ter neoadjuvant chemoradiation and perhaps even only at surgery."
"A 69-year-old male has recently completed neoadjuvant  chemoradiation followed by a low anterior resection with  diverting ileostomy. At the time of diagnosis, clinical stag - ing with MRI revealed a T3 tumor with 4- to 5-subcentim - eter lymph nodes in the perirectal area. Surgical pathology  revealed a complete pathological response with none of 12  lymph nodes involved. He presents now for recommenda - tions for care. Which of the following are reasonable op - tions",D,"The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who undergo preoperative chemoradiation is controversial. In the EORTC 22921 study, patients who received preopera tive radiation underwent randomization to four cycles of postoperative 5 FU and leucovorin versus no further ther apy. In a subgroup analysis of patients who underwent a complete R0 resection, the addition of postoperative chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in those whose tumors were downstaged to T0 from T2 but not those staged at T3/T4. However, other studies have failed to show a better outcome with postoperative chemo therapy in patients with greater downstaging. The PROC TOR/SCRIPT study, where patients underwent radiation followed by total mesorectal excision, also showed no dif ference in overall survival if patients received postopera tive capecitabine versus observation. A phase 3 study from the United Kingdom, a clinical trial, looked at people who received postoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin ver sus no adjuvant chemotherapy. There was a trend toward improved disease free survival in those patients, but the study was closed when it had significant issues with ap proval. In patients with an excellent response to therapy, it is reasonable to consider treatment with 5 FU and oxalipl atin, 5 FU compound alone, or even observation."
"A 47-year-old female presents to an oncologist for rec - ommendations for her care. She was recently was hos - pitalized for acute onset right-lower-quadrant pain and  diagnosed with appendicitis. At surgery, her appendix  was inflamed without perforation and an appendectomy  was performed. Pathology revealed a T2, 7-mm focus of  invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins. You  recommend:  ",B,Incidental adenocarcinoma found at the time of an appen dectomy should be treated with a return to the OR for a completion hemicolectomy and lymph node dissection to accurately stage the patient’s disease. Adjuvant chemo therapy can then be determined based on this staging.
"A 23-year-old male presents to the emergency room with  a large lower gastrointestinal bleed. On colonoscopy, he  is found to have hundreds of polyps carpeting his colon,  with a dominant, friable mass in his sigmoid colon; it is  biopsied and found to be a well-differentiated adenocar - cinoma. Which of the following is not true regarding the  genetic cancer predisposition syndrome that he likely has",C,"FAP accounts for less than 1% of colon cancer. This is an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition syndrome re sulting from a mutation in the APC gene. Such patients are at risk for developing colon cancer, with 100% penetrance usually at an average age of 45. These patients are also at increased risk for gastric cancers, adenomas, and duo denal polyps as well as thyroid cancer and CNS tumors, mostly medulloblastoma. The patient should be referred for a total colectomy owing to the complete penetrance of this genetic syndrome."
Which of the following is not an appropriate first-line  chemotherapy option for her,B,"Multiple randomized phase 3 clinical trials have confirmed the equivalence of 5 fluorouracil (5 FU) and oxaliplatin chemotherapy and 5 FU and irinotecan chemotherapy in the first line metastatic colorectal cancer setting. For all patients, the addition of the targeted agent bevacizumab has been shown to improve PFS and, in conflicting stud ies, overall survival. Recent studies have also shown that chemotherapy with 5 FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin com bined with bevacizumab as compared with 5 FU, oxalipl atin, and bevacizumab may be superior in terms of overall survival. The TRIBE study as well as STEAM both sug gested that quadruple chemotherapy may be more active than triplet therapy. For this patient, all of the options are reasonable except for the cetuximab, as her KRAS muta tion would indicate that she would not benefit from the addition of that agent."
"A 61-year-old female presents for a follow-up visit with  her medical oncologist. She was diagnosed 18 months  earlier with KRAS wild-type metastatic colon cancer to  the lungs and was treated with 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and  bevacizumab for 12 months. Her disease progressed  and has been on 5-FU, irinotecan, and cetuximab for 6  months. A CT scan taken a week earlier shows progres - sive disease in the lungs and new lesions in the liver.  Which of the following is a reasonable next treatment  option",A,"This patient has been treated with 5 FU, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab as well as the second line regimen of 5 FU, irinotecan, and cetuximab. There are no data to suggest that treatment with another anti EGFR antibody such as panitumumab would be useful in a patient who has already progressed on cetuximab. Because this patient has disease in the lungs and the liver, treatment with ra diation or surgery would also not be reasonable. There are no data suggesting that colon cancer patients are resensitized to treatments on which they have already progressed. Accordingly treatment with regorafenib, which has been FDA approved for heavily pretreat ed metastatic colon cancer, would be the appropriate option."
What grade  3 side effect is she most likely to experience,C,"Although all of the side effects associated with TAS 102 are known, grade 3 neutropenia, seen in 38% of patients, is most commonly a high grade toxicity of this agent, as shown in the seminal study leading to the agent’s approv al."
"A 44-year-old female presents for initial medical oncology  consultation after a new diagnosis of colon cancer meta - static to the liver. She has seen a liver surgeon, and her  disease has been deemed unresectable. You recommend  systemic chemotherapy. Which of the following in not cor- rect when you counsel her",C,"Maintenance chemotherapy has been controversial, with conflicting results in metastatic colorectal cancer. The OP TIMOX1 and two other studies had conflicting results, with OPTIMOX1 showing maintenance 5 FU versus observa tion having no survival benefit, while OPTIMOX2—a trial that was halted after only 202 of 600 patients were cured— showed an improvement in PFS but not overall survival. The MRC COIN study was a trial showing that median survival was not better in the continuous arm versus the intermittent for patients treated with first line oxaliplatin and 5 FU. The addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine as maintenance Colorectal and Anal Cancer 149 therapy in the CAIRO3 study showed improvement in PFS but not overall survival. The AIO 0207 study—which rand omized patients to bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab versus observation—showed a possible ben efit to the arms that received bevacizumab, although the benefit was very small and there was no overall survival benefit. Accordingly patients can be treated with mainte nance chemotherapy. However, they should be counseled that, based on the studies that have been reported thus far, although this is likely to show a PFS benefit, it is unlikely to show an overall survival benefit."
Which of the following are contraindications to continuing  bevacizumab therapy in colon cancer patients,B,"Bevacizumab is known to increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis as well as hypertension. However, the presence of these entities in itself does not require discontinuation of therapy. Wound dehiscence is an absolute contraindication to bevacizumab therapy. Chronic kidney disease and CNS metastases are both circumstances where, based on the par ticular patient, an individual could be treated with bevaci zumab; those with CNS metastases plus bleeding may be at higher risk versus patients with CNS metastases alone."
Which of the following statements is NOT true about anti- EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and panitumumab,B,"The EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and panitumumab do not provide benefit for the patients who have mutations in KRAS, BRAF, or NRAS. The acneiform rash associated with these agents can decrease or increase with time on therapy. Prophylaxis with sunscreen emollients and oral doxycycline have been shown to decrease the problems posed by the rash, and these agents have been shown to be useful in combina tion with chemotherapy backbones as well as single agents."
"A 71-year-old female has an appointment with her medi - cal oncologist to discuss the next steps in her therapy. She  was diagnosed with metastatic cecal cancer 2½ years ear - lier. Her cancer is RAS wild-type, and she has received  treatment with 5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, capecitabine,  bevacizumab, cetuximab, TAS-102, and, most recently, re - gorafenib, all with disease progression. Her performance  status is ECOG 1, but she reports that she does feel her  quality of life has suffered over the past 2 years owing to  side effects of her chemotherapy. Options for the next step  in her therapy include:  ",E,"The patient has an excellent performance status, but as her past treatments are surveyed, she has received all of the standard treatments for her disease. The agent that she has not received, panitumumab, has no proven benefit in pa tients who have already progressed on cetuximab. At this point, the patient could reasonably be offered comfort care as well as referral to a clinical trial. Molecular profiling for actionable mutations leads to the finding of actionable mu tation in approximately 10% of patients."
"A 43-year-old male with HIV presents to his colorectal  surgeon for follow-up evaluation. The patient has a long  history of perianal fistulas complicated by multiple bouts  of recurrent abscesses requiring surgical drainage and  antibiotics over the preceding 3 years, including ICU ad - mission for sepsis. He is currently on chronically suppres - sive antibiotics and has an enhancing fluid collection that  has not resolved with surgical drainage over the past 6  months. On rigid proctoscopic examination, a firm mass is  found along the fistula tract that is biopsied and reported  as squamous cell cancer. MRI imaging confirms the mass,  along with enlarged perirectal lymph nodes but no distant  metastases. Radiation oncology recommends concurrent  chemoradiation and consults oncology for chemotherapy  recommendations. You recommend:  ",B,"This patient has a chronic infection that is active; accord ingly, therapy with mitomycin C, which is known to signifi cantly cause prolonged neutropenia, could be particularly dangerous for this patient. Clinical trials have evaluated whether therapies with cisplatin instead of mitomycin C, 5 FU, would be reasonable as a substitution. The ACT II tri als randomized 940 non HIV infected patients to cisplatin versus mitomycin C with 5 FU. The 3 year colostomy free survival, progression free survival, and overall survival are similar between the two arms. Of note, there has been another study, the RTOG 98 11 trial, showing that cisplatin may be inferior to mitomycin C, although that trial enrolled fewer patients. Based on these data, in the scenario where the patient would be significantly at risk with prolonged neutropenia, cisplatin can be considered instead of mitomy cin C as a part of the concurrent chemoradiation regimen."
0 cm in diameter. FDG-PET reveals  a highly FDG-avid anal mass and moderately avid right  inguinal lymph node. What is the next step in this patient’s  care,A,"This patient has a T1 anal cancer with a right inguinal node. The inguinal node is on the borderline in terms of size. However, involvement of the right inguinal lymph node region would significantly change this patient’s staging, moving it from stage I to stage III disease. Accordingly it is important to biopsy the lymph node to ascertain whether it is involved in terms of the cancer. FDG PET can show increased SUV with both inflammation and malignancy, so it cannot distinguish whether this lymph node is benign or malignant."
FDG-PET scan per - formed 2 months after surgery shows complete resolution  of the mass and rigid anoscopy shows a scar at the tumor  site that is biopsy negative for malignancy. What should be  the plan going forward,D,"Surveillance guidelines for anal cancer after treatment with concurrent chemoradiation include physical exam with inguinal node palpation, digital rectal exam, and en doscopy every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. For patients with any signs of residual cancer or T3 or T4 disease, annual imaging for the first 3 years is also reasonable."
"A 56-year-old female with pain with defecation presents to  a gastroenterologist for evaluation. Rigid anoscopy reveals  a 1-cm mass 3 cm from the anal verge.

Which of the following is true regarding HCC,C,"Most national and international guidelines recommend biannual liver ultrasound and AFP measurement for HCC screening. The role of newer techniques such as CT and MRI remains unclear in this setting. Liver biopsy is indi cated in selected cases, and it carries a 0.4% risk of hemor rhage.

The MELD consists of serum biliru bin, creatinine levels, INR levels, and recently included sodium level. It is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end stage liver disease and is used as a disease severity index to determine organ allocation pri orities. Surgical resection is reserved for patients without underlying portal hypertension, favorable anatomical criteria, and good hepatic function to leave behind an adequate liver remnant. Transarterial therapy is reserved for locally advanced disease. There is no clear data to support use of systemic therapy with TACE. Sorafenib is indicated in the advanced setting."

Transarterial chemoembolization is an option for locally advanced unresectable tumors, with a survival advan tage over best supportive care. Transarterial embolization with microspheres alone was shown to be comparable to chemoem bolization with doxorubicin eluting beads (DEBs) in a rand omized trial. Liver irradiation did not show disease control in HCC, with higher doses causing radiation hepatitis. Newer techniques to minimize tissue exposure are being investigated. Radioembolization using yttrium 90 loaded spheres also dem onstrated good results in locally advanced Child Pugh A dis ease. Cryoablation is not adopted in HCC due to complications and high local recurrence rate. The best results were achieved when RFA is applied in tumors less than 5 cm.

The  tumor involves the retrohepatic IVC with lymph node in - volvement at the level of the porta hepatitis. The patient  was started on sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Three weeks  later, he developed grade 2 skin toxicity for the first time. A  suitable next step would be:  ",B,"One of the more common adverse events seen with sorafenib is hand foot skin reaction, a dermatological toxicity usual ly localized to the pressure points of the palms and soles. Although hand foot skin reaction is reversible and not life threatening, it can have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life and may necessitate dose modification. Hand foot skin reaction occurred in 8% of cases in the randomized clinical trial of sorafenib versus placebo. For the first ap pearance of grade 2 skin toxicity, recommendation is to hold treatment until grade 0 1 and resume at the same dose. For the second appearance, it is recommended to resume at 400 mg/day. For grade 3 skin toxicity, interrupt treatment until grade 0 1 and resume at 400 mg for the first appearance, 400 mg every 2 days for the second appearance, and discontinue treatment permanently for the third appearance."

What would be an appro - priate recommendation at this time",A,"A subcentimeter, submucosal low grade rectal NET (T1) is almost never associated with malignant behavior. Meta static spread is associated with the size of the rectal tumor (usually >2 cm), invasiveness (typically T2 or above), and tumor grade. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines do not recommend any further evalu ation or treatment in a patient with a subcentimeter low grade T1 rectal tumor who has undergone endoscopic resection. If there had been residual disease, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or another method of endoscopic management would be appropriate. Radiographic stag ing and surgical resection are not recommended for small, T1 tumors. Rectal NETs are not hormonally functional, so measurement of urine 5 HIAA would not be appropriate, even in a patient with a larger or more invasive tumor. Chromogranin A measurement is also not appropriate in this scenario, where risk of malignant behavior is negligi ble."
"A 64-year-old man presents with acute small bowel ob - struction. CT scans reveal a transition point in the mid- small intestine.

No metastatic disease is noted intraopera - tively. Postoperative CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and  pelvis reveal no evidence of metastatic disease. Which  course of treatment is most appropriate at this time",C,"Small bowel adenocarcinomas are rare, and data from prospective trials are limited. There have been no pro spective studies of adjuvant chemotherapy for small bowel adenocarcinoma. However, there is evidence of activity of chemotherapy regimens used in colon cancer in the metastatic setting. Therefore adjuvant FOLFOX is recommended for stage III small bowel adenocarcinoma, similar to the recommendation for stage III adenocarci noma of the colon."
"A 56-year-old man presented with right lower quadrant ab - dominal pain. A CT scan revealed a 3-cm pericecal mass.  Colonoscopy was unremarkable. He underwent an explora - tory laparotomy with right hemicolectomy. During surgery,  he was found to have peritoneal nodules, one of which was  biopsied. Pathology revealed a goblet cell carcinoid tumor  of the appendix measuring 4 cm in diameter and invading  the subserosa. The peritoneal nodule was positive for meta - static disease. He recovered from surgery. A postoperative  PET scan 2 months later demonstrated scattered hyper - metabolic peritoneal nodules. Which of the following treat - ments of would be most appropriate at this time",D,"Goblet cell carcinoid tumors, also known as adenocarci noids, typically originate in the appendix. Pathologically, they combine features of a carcinoid tumor and adenocar cinoma, but their malignant behavior is more similar to appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Metastatic spread tends to be peritoneal. Treatment recommendations are based on case reports and small series suggesting response to regi mens used in colon cancer such as FOLFOX. The role of biological agents used in colon cancer (VEGF and EGFR inhibitors) is uncertain. Octreotide LAR, everolimus, and 177Lu Dotatate are appropriate for treatment of well dif ferentiated NETs, not adenocarcinoids. Carboplatin plus etoposide are used in poorly differentiated neuroendo crine carcinomas."
A 58-year-old woman presents with abdominal distention  and bloating. She undergoes a CT scan revealing fluid col - lections within the abdominal cavity with scalloping of the  surface of the liver and spleen. There is a 2-cm complex  lesion around the appendix. Needle aspiration of a fluid  collection yields a diagnosis of adenomucinosis. Which  treatment would be most appropriate at this time,A,"This patient has a diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei, now more commonly known as disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM). The condition is characterized by accumulation of mucinous material within the perito neal cavity, typically originating in a primary appendiceal adenoma. Standard treatment consists of aggressive surgi cal debulking. Addition of heated intraperitoneal chemo therapy (HIPEC), typically mitomycin, allows for high concentrations of chemotherapy to accumulate within the peritoneal cavity, and appears to improve long term out comes, although randomized studies comparing debulk ing surgery with or without HIPEC have not been per formed. This approach may also be useful for low grade mucin producing appendiceal adenocarcinomas. Patients with high grade carcinomas, or cancers with visceral metastases, are less likely to benefit from this approach. Systemic intravenous chemotherapy is unlikely to be of benefit for a patient with DPAM. Intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel is an appropriate postoperative regimen for stage III ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal carcinoma. Observation is not an appropriate option for a symptomat ic patient.Neuroendocrine, Small Bowel, and Appendiceal Malignancies 157"

8-cm left upper lobe lung lesion with  hilar adenopathy. Octreoscan shows very mild (grade 1) ra - diotracer uptake in the liver and left hilum. Which systemic  treatment would be most appropriate at this time,D,"This patient has a metastatic lung NET. The RADIANT 4 study demonstrated improvement in PFS with everolimus compared with placebo in patients with low and interme diate grade NETs originating in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and lungs. Thus everolimus is an appropriate treat ment choice. Octreotide LAR and lanreotide were never tested in a randomized study that included lung NETs. Al though they are commonly used in patients with advanced lung NETs, they are unlikely to be active in this case: a rela tively aggressive malignancy that expresses very low lev els of somatostatin receptors. Sunitinib and streptozotocin are approved for advanced pancreatic NETs but have no evidence of activity in lung NETs."
"A 39-year-old woman presents with acute appendicitis  and undergoes laparoscopic appendectomy. In addition  to findings of acute appendicitis, the pathology report de - scribes a 1-cm well-differentiated carcinoid tumor in the  tip of the appendix extending into the muscularis propria.  The ki-67 index is 1%. The patient recovers quickly from  the appendectomy and presents for consultation. Which of  the following is the appropriate recommendation",A,"Carcinoid tumors of the appendix are discovered inciden tally in approximately 1 in 300 appendectomies. They are usually found in the tip of the appendix. Tumor size ap pears to predict malignant behavior: in one large series with long term follow up, none of 127 patients with tu mors <2 cm in diameter developed metastatic disease. The risk of malignant behavior of a 1 cm low grade appendi ceal carcinoid tumor is negligible, and no further workup or treatment is indicated after a simple appendectomy. For tumors larger than 2 cm, completion right hemicolectomy with lymph node staging is recommended. In recent years, there have been reports of patients with tumors 1 to 2 cm in diameter who developed locoregional metastases. The risk of malignant spread appears to correlate with invasion into the mesoappendix. Consequently, hemicolectomy can be considered for select patients with tumors of intermedi ate size (1–2 cm) based on significant depth of invasion."
"A 67-year-old woman with a metastatic small bowel neu - roendocrine tumor and carcinoid syndrome has been on  octreotide LAR 30 mg every 4 weeks for 2 years. Prior to  starting octreotide, she had significant diarrhea (averaging  6 times a day), flushing (averaging twice a day), and an  elevated urine 5-HIAA of 76 mg (nl < 15). Her flushing and  diarrhea improved initially, but she now reports that she  is experiencing increased diarrhea and bloating. CT scans  show stable liver metastases, and urine 5-HIAA is mildly  elevated at 22 mg. Which treatment would be most appro - priate at this time",A,"This patient likely has malabsorption and steatorrhea re sulting from her octreotide treatment and its effects on pancreatic exocrine function. This is a common side effect of somatostatin analogs and should be treated with pancre atic enzymes. Given the fact that her urine 5 HIAA is only mildly elevated, it is unlikely that her diarrhea is related to progressive carcinoid syndrome. Therefore increasing the dose of octreotide or performing hepatic arterial emboli zation are unlikely to be of benefit. Nonspecific antidiar rheals, such as loperamide or diphenoxylate atropine, are unlikely to be as effective as pancrelipase if the cause of the diarrhea is pancreatic malabsorption."
"5-cm tumor in the tail of the  pancreas. Core needle biopsy of the liver reveals a well- differentiated, intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumor  with 16 mitoses per 10 high-power fields. Which of the fol - lowing systemic therapies are most likely to lead to signifi - cant tumor shrinkage",E,"This patient presents with a relatively aggressive pancre atic NET. Sunitinib and everolimus are both approved for treatment of advanced, progressive pancreatic NETs based on results of phase III clinical trials, but are associated with objective radiographic response rates of less than 10% and generally result in disease stabilization. Likewise, lanreo tide was compared with placebo in a randomized clinical trial of patients with gastroenteropancreatic NETs (ki67 < 10%) and demonstrated improvement in PFS. Response rates were negligible. Octreotide has never been tested in a randomized trial of pancreatic NETs, but has a similar mechanism of action to lanreotide and almost never pro duces an objective radiographic response. Cytotoxic drugs, specifically temozolomide and streptozotocin based regi mens, have never been tested in randomized phase III tri als, but are associated with high objective response rates in pancreatic NETs. In one series of 30 patients, the combi nation of capecitabine and temozolomide was associated with an objective response rate of 70%. Other retrospective series have demonstrated similar response rates. Capecit abine/temozolomide is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as an option for managing pancreatic NETs and represents a particularly appropriate choice in a patient with symptoms related to high tumor burden."

She has tried omeprazole in the  past with no relief, but does not currently take any ant - acids. She denies any other gastrointestinal symptoms.  The procedure reveals mildly erythematous gastric mu - cosa and four gastric body polyps measuring about 4 to  8 mm in size. The gastroenterologist performs endoscopic  polypectomy of all four lesions. Pathology reveals a low- grade carcinoid tumor. Which test should be performed  next",A,"Carcinoid (neuroendocrine) tumors of the stomach are cat egorized into three types. Type 1 gastric NETs, which repre sent over 80% of cases, arise in the setting of atrophic gastri tis. In this condition, chronic gastric achlorhydria stimulates the G cells of the antrum to produce excess serum gastrin. Gastrin, in turn, simulates neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and development of multifocal, polypoid carcinoid tumors. These tumors generally behave in a benign fashion. Type 2 gastric carcinoid tumors also arise in the setting of elevated serum gastrin. In these rare tumors, elevated gastrin is pro duced by a pancreatic or duodenal gastrinoma. As is the case with type I disease, tumors tend to be small, multifo cal, and clinically indolent. Patients with type 2 gastric NETs will usually have underlying symptoms of Zollinger Ellison syndrome such as diarrhea, heartburn, and peptic ulcera tion as well as radiographic evidence of an underlying gas trinoma. Sporadic gastric NETs (type 3) occur in fewer than 15% of cases and are not associated with elevated gastrin levels. These tumors have a much higher malignant poten tial than type 1 or type 2 tumors. Measurement of serum gastrin is the first step in the evaluation of gastric carcinoid tumors because it can distinguish type 1 and 2 (hypergas trinemic) from type 3 (normal serum gastrin). It is impor tant to emphasize that proton pump inhibitors raise serum gastrin, leading to false positive results. The patient in this case almost certainly has type 1 gastric NETs given the pres ence of small multifocal tumors and absence of symptoms suggestive of Zollinger Ellison syndrome. Serum gastrin will, almost certainly, be elevated, and the patient should be managed with endoscopic surveillance. There is no need for radiographic staging studies. Serum chromogranin A is typically elevated in the setting of atrophic gastritis and is not a useful tumor marker."

Both octreotide and lanreotide inhibit secretion of serotonin and other vasoactive substanc es, thus palliating flushing and diarrhea associated with the carcinoid syndrome. Moreover, both drugs have been shown to significantly inhibit tumor growth. The PROMID study randomized 85 patients with midgut NETs to receive octreotide LAR IM versus placebo and demonstrated a sig nificant improvement in median time to progression from 6 months to 14.5 months.

Everolimus was found to significantly improve PFS in patients with progres sive nonfunctional NETs of the GI tract and lungs in the ran domized phase III RADIANT 4 study. Although everolimus can be considered in patients with progressive tumors, it is not an appropriate first line treatment for this patient. Vari ous hepatic arterial embolization modalities (bland, chemo, or radioembolization) are associated with high rates of ra diographic, biochemical, and symptomatic responses in patients with progressive or symptomatic liver metastases, but have not been studied in randomized controlled trials.

5-cm tumor in the tail of the pan - creas. Which blood test is likely to reveal the underlying  diagnosis,C,"Pancreatic NETs producing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIPomas) typically originate in the tail of the pancreas. VIP stimulates intestinal secretion and inhibits electro lyte and water absorption. The resulting syndrome (also known as the Verner Morrison syndrome) is character ized by severe watery diarrhea, often exceeding 3 L a day. Other complications include hypochlorhydria, hypoka lemia, and dehydration. The VIPoma syndrome often re sponds rapidly to somatostatin analog therapy. Although serotonin, gastrin, and calcitonin can all produce diarrhea among other symptoms, they almost never cause the se vere electrolyte abnormalities that are observed with VIP secretion."

MEN1 is an autosomal dominant syndrome character ized by a predisposition to endocrine tumors of the anterior pituitary, parathyroid glands, and pancreas/ duodenum. Gastrinoma is the most common type of functional pancreaticoduodenal NET in MEN1 pa tients. The underlying tumor suppressor gene mutation has been identified in the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13). MEN1 encodes for menin, a nuclear protein that regulates gene transcription through chromatin remod eling. Medullary thyroid cancers pheochromocytomas (and occasionally paragangliomas) are associated with MEN2 and are caused by mutations of the RET gene. Familial paragangliomas are more often associated with mutations of the SDH enzyme complex. Hereditary re nal cell carcinoma occurs in VHL, a syndrome that is also associated with pancreatic NETs."

Which two of his cardiac valves are likely dysfunctional",D,"This patient very likely has carcinoid heart disease, a condition that predominantly affects the right heart, causing fibrosis and thickening of the tricuspid and pul monary valves. The result is typically tricuspid insuffi ciency and pulmonary valve stenosis, eventually leading to right heart failure. Circulating serotonin is thought to be the most important etiological factor, although other secreted substances may also contribute to the condi tion. The right heart valves and endocardium are most directly exposed to serotonin secreted into the systemic circulation, whereas the mitral and aortic valves are rela tively spared due to inactivation of serotonin in the pul monary circulation."
A 67-year-old man with metastatic ileal neuroendocrine  tumor and carcinoid syndrome receives treatment with  octreotide LAR 30 mg every 4 weeks. Routine 6-month CT  scans demonstrate progression of liver and retroperitoneal  metastases.

Everolimus has been evaluated in two randomized studies that included ileal NETs. In the RADIANT 2 study, which randomized patients with advanced NETs and a history of carcinoid syndrome to receive everoli mus plus octreotide versus placebo plus octreotide, the PFS improvement with everolimus fell narrowly short of statistical significance. In the subsequent RADIANT 4 study, which randomized patients with nonfunctional NETs to receive everolimus versus placebo, PFS was im proved in a statistically significant fashion.

In asymp tomatic cases, modification of treatment is not necessary. However, because the patient is symptomatic, treatment of this side effect is necessary. Standard management consists of dose interruption, often with a short course of corticos teroids. Dose reduction may be appropriate after resolu tion of symptoms."
"The clinical picture is less consistent with infectious pneu - monia, although pulmonary infection should be consid - ered in the differential given the immunosuppressive  properties of everolimus. If symptoms do not improve  with treatment interruption and steroids, an infectious  workup may be appropriate.

Which of the following  modifications do you recommend",B,"Understand the treatment related morbidity and mortality associated with cabazitaxel. The randomized phase III trial with cabazitaxel in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer suggested the risk of neutropenia. It was seen in 94% of patients with 8% of patients having febrile neutro penia. For this reason, consideration of growth factor sup port may be appropriate for this patient. Although lower doses have been evaluated, there are no data supporting a 50% dose reduction due to age. The risks of neuropathy and adrenal insufficiency are not high, based on the phase III data."
"A 56-year-old man complains of back pain and is evalu - ated by his primary care doctor. Plain films of his back  show osteoblastic lesions. His PSA is evaluated and found  to be 124 ng/mL.

Which of the follow therapies is not indicated in this  patient",E,"Understand the therapy indicated for metastatic castra tion sensitive prostate cancer. Based on phase III clinical data, this patient with high volume metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer is likely to have improved sur vival with the combined treatment of ADT and docetaxel for 6 cycles. As with all patients on ADT, supplemental treatment with calcium and vitamin D is recommended to decrease the risk of osteoporosis or osteopenia related to castrate levels of testosterone. In a randomized study, adding zoledronic acid to ADT and docetaxel in metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer did not demonstrate clinical benefit."

In considering treat - ment options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate  cancer, which of the following comorbidities is a relative  contraindication for enzalutamide treatment",C,"Understand the relative contraindications for treatment with enzalutamide. Patients with a history of seizure dis order, or those with medications that substantially lower the seizure threshold, were not enrolled in the phase III trials of enzalutamide due to a concern of increased risk of seizures in those patients. For that reason, an alternative therapy should be considered in this patient if he has a his tory of seizure disorder. Patients with liver metastasis or cardiovascular disease were eligible for those trials."

These findings are most consistent with variants of prostate cancer that may have changes in the androgen receptor (including splice variants), which may be driv ing tumor growth. Pseudo progression is not seen with antiandrogen therapy. The rising PSA makes neuroendo crine prostate cancer or a secondary malignancy less likely. Antiandrogen therapy, such as abiraterone enzalutamide, demonstrated efficacy in castration resistant disease in large phase III trials."

What is the most appropriate next step in treatment,B,"Understand the clinical course of de differentiated/small cell variant prostate cancer. This patient has a rapid ac celeration of metastatic disease and clinical symptoms in the absence of a concomitant and appropriate rise in PSA. This raises concerns for de differentiated/small cell vari ant prostate cancer, and thus, a biopsy would be the ap propriate next step. This pattern of spread does not fit with colon cancer despite the development of liver metastases. Neither bicalutamide therapy nor radium 223 would be in dicated in this patient. Enzalutamide would be preferred over bicalutamide if the disease was thought to be respon sive to an antiandrogen while liver metastases preclude the use of radium"

How do you reply to the patient and his daughter  who you are seeing in your office,A,"Understand the implications of lymph node only prostate cancer. Although rare, a retrospective study from TAX 327 demonstrated that patients with lymph node only disease have a more indolent course than patients with disease that has (also) spread to the bones and/or organs. While treatment implications of these findings are untested, the understanding of these data could inform treatment selec tion in some cases."

What do you tell this patient about ini - tiating ADT,B,"Understand the mechanism of action of radium 223 and implications for toxicity. Radium 223 is an alpha emitter, and thus has a smaller emission radius relative to older ra diopharmaceuticals (strontium and samarium), and thus has less potential for cytopenias in most patients. There was no significant difference in cytopenias between ra dium 223 and placebo in the phase III trial. It is likely that patients with significant marrow involvement will have a greater risk of cytopenias."
"6 ng/mL. Ultimately, a prostate biopsy yields Glea - son 9 prostate cancer. CT and bone scans demonstrated  metastatic disease in L3 and L4, in three ribs, sternum, and  scapula. You discuss treatment recommendations for this  patient.

There is no clear standard of care for this population. Retrospective data suggest that PSA doubling time may be more informative than absolute PSA value in determining when to initiate ADT. There are no absolute values that require initiation of ADT. There are no data to support chemotherapy in this population.
"4 ng/mL and he has widely metastatic  disease on bone scan. The patient is willing to start chemo - therapy, but read online about the “new one.” When you  mention that you recommend docetaxel, he says that he  wants to start cabazitaxel instead because it is “new” and  therefore must be superior. How do you respond to this  patient and his request",E,"Understand the treatment recommendations for castra tion sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. This patient has newly diagnosed castration sensitive metastatic prostate Prostate Cancer 168 cancer with a high tumor volume based on the phase III study. Thus ADT with docetaxel is indicated. For all pa tients on ADT, calcium and vitamin D are recommended to diminish the risk/magnitude of ADT related osteopo rosis/osteopenia. Zoledronic acid is only indicated for castration resistant disease and not in castration sensitive metastatic prostate cancer."

You also notice a coffee stain  on his shirt and the patient explains that his morning cof - fee slipped from his hands prior to his visit. Upon further  questioning, he notes that he recently has had difficulty  gripping eating utensils and has had increased episodes  of tripping at home. On exam you notice the patient has  decreased sensation in his fingers and toes, but strength is  preserved in all extremities. What is the most appropriate  next step in the care of this patient",C,"Understand the risk and manifestation of osteonecrosis of the jaw with the rank ligand inhibitor denosumab. Simi lar to zoledronic acid, densumab also carries an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Phase III studies suggest an incidence of 5%, but the actual incidence could be higher. While poor wound healing from prednisone may contribute to the morbidity, it is likely not the initiating event. There is unclear attribution to ADT in this setting, and metastatic lesions to the jaw are less common than the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw."
"A 75-year-old male with metastatic castration-resistant  prostate cancer is currently on treatment with abirater - one 1000 mg and prednisone 10 mg, which was initiated  2 months ago after the patient had progressive disease on  docetaxel.

A review of his CBC and chemistries demonstrates  stable findings, including PS",A,"Understand the treatment related toxicity of docetaxel. This patient likely has taxane related neuropathy interfer ing with activities of daily living. His docetaxel should be at least held until the resolution of symptoms, and discon tinuing therapy should be considered in the absence of rapid improvement of his neuropathic symptoms. These symptoms are unlikely to be related to diabetes, and given their sensory nature (in the absence of motor findings) cord compression would also be unlikely. B12 and folate supplementation are unlikely to address this toxicity, nor will holding the patient’s ADT."
"A 63-year-old man with metastatic castration-resistant  prostate cancer discontinues docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3  weeks and prednisone 10 mg daily for peripheral neuropa - thy.

Although the patient has been treated  previously with abiraterone and enzalutamide, he has not  yet been treated with sipuleucel-T. Which of the following  statements is correct with regard to sipuleucel-T",A,"Understand the treatment related toxicity associated with abiraterone. This patient’s bilateral lower extremity edema is most likely associated with the recent initiation of abira terone therapy. While prednisone may cause fluid reten tion, it is actually included as a treatment with abirater one to minimize side effects, such as edema. Deep venous thrombosis is unlikely to present with bilateral edema. The patient’s stable PSA would make cancer related DIC less likely. Lymphangitic spread from prostate cancer is rare and usually does not manifest itself as lower extremity edema."
"8, he has moderate symptoms (ECOG PS 1), and  metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes, liver (a single 2 cm le - sion), and bone (pelvis, thoracic spine and third and fourth  ribs). The patient’s friend has received radium 223, so he  asks you about receiving this treatment as well. Which of  the following characteristics precludes this patient from  receiving radium 223 based on available data",B,"Understand the potential role for sipuleucel T in ad vanced prostate cancer. The phase III trial of sipuleucel T enrolled a minority of patients after treatment with docetaxel, provided they were 3 months’ removed from chemotherapy. Thus, this patient could consider sipuleu cel T, but should be educated that PSA responses are un common. Peripheral neuropathy is not a toxicity related to sipuleucel T. There are no data to suggest that previous prednisone precludes possible benefit from sipuleucel T. Clinical data suggest that patients receiving sipuleucel T while on prednisone do not have diminished immune ac tivation of the vaccine product. Although retrospective data suggest that patients with lower PSAs may have bet ter clinical outcomes than patients with higher PSAs, PSA itself should not preclude the patient from the potential benefit with sipuleucel T."

What is the most appropriate next  step in care of this patient",B,"Understand the treatment recommendations for patients with lymph nodes that are found to be positive for meta static disease after radical prostatectomy. A randomized study demonstrated that androgen deprivation therapy can improve survival in patients who have lymph node positive disease at prostatectomy compared to patients who delay androgen deprivation therapy until overt metastatic disease. There are no randomized data to sup port the use of enzalutamide, docetaxel, or stereotactic radiation in these patients. Although denosumab delays the development of metastatic disease in patients who are nonmetastatic, its role in this specific population remains undefined."
"A 75-year-old man with metastatic castration-resistant  prostate cancer presents to you with a rising PSA on an - drogen deprivation therapy.

This patient has a rising PSA despite stable findings on imaging and stable symptomatology. Based on the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria and the phase III trials of enzalutamide in metastatic disease, the patient should not have his treatment decisions based solely on PSA in the absence of corroborating radiographic evidence, symptomatic progression, or treatment related toxicity. Therefore, it would be most advisable to continue enzalutamide in this patient at this time."

He presents to your office  with increasing lower back pain and urinary retention over  the last 24 hours. You also notice that he needs help getting  up from the chair to the examination table. Currently, he is  only taking NSAIDs for his pain symptoms, but that has  been less helpful in the last few days, and the patient is  requesting narcotics for pain control. What should be your  next step in working up this patient’s symptoms",C,"Understand the toxicity profile related to sipuleucel T. Sip uleucel T is associated most commonly with chills, fever, and headache. There is no commonly associated bone flare or pain related symptoms.

This pa tient has early signs of cord compression and documented disease in the spine, and therefore should be evaluated Prostate Cancer 169 with an MRI. Although incontinence is often associated with cord compression, early cord compression could manifest itself with urinary and fecal retention. The in creased pain and proximal muscle weakness in the legs that are manifested by the patient’s difficulty getting out of the chair are consistent with cord compression. While pain symptoms should be addressed, imaging should be done urgently."
"He was later biopsied and found to  have Gleason 3+3 prostate cancer in 3 of 12 cores. He has  a medical history of coronary artery disease (2 MIs in the  last year), diabetes, and hypertension. He comes to you  for consultation after speaking with a radiation oncologist  about potentially curative radiation therapy. What is your  most appropriate recommendation",A,"Understand the limited role of the NaF PET scan in meta static castration resistant prostate cancer. Although an NaF PET scan is FDA approved for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, its clinical role remains unde fined. It was not evaluated at baseline for this patient, so its relevance in this case is further in question since it is likely to be more sensitive than a bone scan. Further more, an NaF PET scan was not used as a metric for dis ease progression in the phase III trials of enzalutamide, so the implications of an NaF PET scan are unclear rela tive to the potential continued efficacy of enzalutamide. A modest rise in PSA, as in this case and in the absence of conventional radiographic imaging showing progres sion, should not be used as an indicator to discontinue or change therapy."

He has seen a radiation oncologist and is now in your of - fice to discuss potential adjuvant ADT as part of the inter - ventions with curative intent. What do you recommend to  the patient,E,"Understand the treatment recommendations for patients with Gleason 6 prostate cancer. There is no role of ADT as part of the radiation therapy for Gleason 6 disease. There are no data to support that surgery would be superior in this case. Also given his age and comorbidities, surgery would likely not be considered. Given the indolent nature of Gleason 6 disease in any patient over 75, it is unlikely that any treatment would be indicated. Especially in this patient with advanced age and comorbidities, it is likely most appropriate to recommend active surveillance or watchful waiting."
"4 ng/ mL. After a discussion of treatment options, the patient  reveals he will adamantly refuse chemotherapy and  wants to know what other options you recommend.

How can  you best characterize this treatment in the context of the  patient’s disease",B,Understand the data regarding ADT in patients receiving external beam radiation for high risk prostate cancer. This patient has high risk prostate cancer based on Gleason 9 disease. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated in creased survival and delayed recurrence in these patients when they were treated with 2 or 3 years of ADT. There are no randomized trials that clearly show a benefit for ra diation or surgery in newly diagnosed patients.

What do you recommend to this   patient,A,"Understand the phase III trial data and the indications for radium 223. Randomized phase III data showed that ra dium 223 delayed symptomatic progression and improved survival in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Patients with lymph nodes greater than 3 cm were exclud ed, but this patient’s lymph nodes are less than 2 cm. The phase III trial enrolled both docetaxel refractory and doc etaxel naïve patients, and both populations demonstrated clinical benefit."

There are no clear data that flutamide improves survival in metastatic disease. Six cy cles of docetaxel would be indicated for newly metastatic castration sensitive disease, but this patient has newly metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Enzaluta mide is contraindicated in patients with recent CVA or low seizure threshold. Docetaxel is not ideal given the patient’s low tumor burden and minimal symptoms. Abiraterone is associated with less treatment toxicity than docetaxel, and thus is most appropriate."
E     Understand the definition of castration-resistant prostate  cancer. Only Patient E has a confirmed rising PSA despite  castration levels of testosterone (patient on long term  ADT).  Patient D is castration sensitive and responding  to ADT appropriately. Patient B has just completed ADT  and likely has suppressed testosterone along with a sup - pressed PS,D,"Understand how to initiate ADT in patients with widely metastatic disease. Because leuprolide (a GnRH agonist) may be associated with a testosterone rise before a fall, this could cause transient pain in this patient with diffuse bone disease. If leuprolide is considered, concomitant use of an AR antagonist, such as bicalutamide, should be considered for the initial treatment phase. Degarelix is a GnRH agonist and thus should not cause a flare in this patient. BIBLIOGRAPHY"
Transurethral  resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) was performed show - ing high-grade muscle invasive transitional cell cancer  (TCC). He was referred to you for further management.  You discuss with the patient the following:  ,A,"Initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy has been shown to improve survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with MVAC has historically shown improvement in overall survival in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer and hence would be ap propriate. While several randomized studies have shown benefits in adjuvant chemotherapy where progression free survival is beneficial, overall survival has not been uni formly seen, and studies have been largely underpowered because they suffered from insufficient accrual. Chemo radiation as a bladder preservation strategy is an option, especially for patients who are deemed unresectable or otherwise refuse cystectomy. Radiation alone is inferior as a therapy for someone who is otherwise a surgical candi date with intent for cure."
"A 48-year-old female with history of spina bifida and LE  paralyzes who has been wheelchair-bound presents to  her urologist for hematuria. She has been doing intermit - tent catheterization and thought it may be secondary to  trauma or another urinary tract infection, which she of - ten gets. Cystoscopy showed a dominant bladder mass,  which, on TURBT, showed pure squamous bladder cancer  invading the detrusor muscle. She has no apparent meta - static disease on staging scans. You counsel her with the  following:  ",C,"Recommend radical cystectomy with anterior pelvic ex enteration and TAH BSO. This patient is presenting with squamous cell muscle invasive bladder cancer. Typical risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include chronic inflammation such as that seen in this patient. While neo adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy would be considered standard, especially for urothelial cancers, even in the case of variants, some other histolo gies, including squamous cell carcinoma, would lead to ineffective, or at times, detrimental delay of primary treat ment of cystectomy."
"A 44-year-old male presents with a suspicious upper  ureteral tract/renal pelvis mass on the right, which was  incidentally found after a routine surveillance scan for  a preceding history of colon cancer that was resected  and treated a year ago. Further ureteroscopy and biop - sy showed a high-grade urothelial cancer on washings  and biopsy. He undergoes definitive right nephroure - terectomy and removal of bladder cuff. Upon further  review of his family history, his father had a history of  colon cancer diagnosed at 48 years of age. You recommend  referral to genetic counseling for testing of the following:  ",A,"This male patient presents with one of the cancer syn dromes involved with colon cancer, with HNPCC or Lynch syndrome. HNPCC is characterized in a family with at least three cases of colon cancer, at least one of whom was diagnosed by 50 years of age, and in which individuals are affected in at least two generations. There is also a well described increased risk of other cancers in both men and women who are HNPCC carriers, such as endometrial and ovarian cancer in women, and stomach, pancreatic, small intestine, biliary tract, ureter, and renal pelvis cancers in both men and women. Upper urinary tract tumors tend to develop at a younger age and are more likely to be in the ureter with an almost equal gender ratio in patients with Lynch syndrome."
1 )  and was found to have a midline mass (inset)  in the area  of the dome of the bladder. Further cystoscopy showed  pathology consistent with adenocarcinoma. Which of the  following is the most appropriate treatment option,B,"Partial cystectomy with en bloc resection of the urachal liga ment with the bladder dome and umbilicus. Urachal carci nomas are almost always adenocarcinoma in histology and frequently involve the midline or dome of the bladder due to the origin of the tumor from the urachal ligament with extension to the dome of the bladder. Clinical distinction of this tumor type with that of other urothelial cancers are important, since treatment choices with surgery or the use of chemotherapy, where there is still no great proven ben efit for neoadjuvant or adjuvant approaches, may matter. Patients who present with resectable tumors can be treated with partial cystectomy with en bloc resection of the urachal ligament with the bladder dome, and removal of the umbili cus is required in order to adequately control the tumor."
A 62-year-old male presents with hematuria. Cystoscopy  and TURBT showed micropapillary variant of urothelial  carcinoma invading into the lamina propria. What would  be the most appropriate next treatment,C,"Consider upfront radical cystoprostatectomy. The micro papillary variant of urothelial carcinoma is considered to be an aggressive variant. While many would recommend radical cystectomy for micropapillary bladder cancer in vading the lamina propria (cT1) given the poor prognosis, contradictory small reports show some efficacy of conserva tive management with intravesical BCG for this disease. Mitomycin is usually used for patients during periopera tive therapy with TURBT in superficial urothelial bladder cancer. While intravesical gemcitabine has been used after BCG failure, this is considered an off label use. There is in creasing interest with upfront radical cystectomy in patients presenting with micropapillary urothelial carcinoma, espe cially since survival is improved in those who undergo early radical cystectomy, but is compromised for those who have recurrent cystectomy, or deferred immediate cystectomy ."
"A 66-year-old male presents for follow-up with a history of  superficial bladder TCC. He had a prior TURBT showing  T1 high-grade TCC and CIS a year prior, and received in - duction BCG. He presented to the urologist and was found  to have + cytology on bladder wash, but there was no evi - dence of apparent tumor during the cystoscopy. What is  the next step in management",D,"Recommend upper tract imaging with CT urography or ureteroscopy with biopsy. Urine cytology has variable sen sitivity of about 35%–61%. However, in cases where one finds a positive urine cytology in the absence of tumors in the bladder, suspicion for an upper tract urothelial carci noma UTUC is high. Therefore, a search for an upper tract tumor using conventional imaging, such as computed to mography (CT) urography, which involves the use of CT technology using thin slices with less than 2 mm using var ious protocols with improved sensitivity over intravenous urography (IVU), such as 75% versus 95.8% for CT urog raphy. A ureteroscopy can be performed for pathological Bladder and Other Urothelial Cancers 176 biopsy with confirmation of the diagnosis. However, the reliability for tumor staging is poor, although grading is good with correlation to the final histopathological grade of close to 90% with grade 1 or higher grade tumors."

You recommended the following  treatment:  ,B,"This patient presents with high grade urothelial carcinoma for which the standard of care remains as surgical resection with radical nephroureterectomy and bladder cuff resec tion, in patients who are otherwise candidates for surgery. While there is increasing use and extrapolation from the bladder cancer data regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin or dd MVAC (similar to that used in muscle invasive bladder cancer for patients who are otherwise cisplatin eligible) substitution of carbo platin for cisplatin would be inferior, and if perioperative chemotherapy cannot be effectively or safely delivered with the use of cisplatin, then surgery would be the most optimal approach."

While regimens using gemcitabine and cisplatin or MVAC may be appropriate for urothelial cancer cell histology, cisplatin and etoposide may work bet ter with small cell pathology. Whereas PCI has been found beneficial in patients with limited disease of small cell lung cancer, its use in bladder cancer is still unproven."
"A 63-year-old male presented with hematuria and was  found to have muscle-invasive bladder cancer. After  hearing the arguments for neoadjuvant chemotherapy,  he opted to proceed with upfront radical cystoprostatec - tomy. However, he has heard about the utility of adju - vant chemotherapy. You begin to discuss with him the  following:  ",E,"All of the above. Adjuvant chemotherapy in bladder can cer has been a topic of long drawn out controversy given several underpowered trials, and especially given lack of adequate accrual. One of the largest trials, the EORTC 30994, showed that immediate chemotherapy for patients with pT3–T4 or node positive bladder cancer result in sig nificant disease free survival, but not overall survival. Con versely, a retrospective database out of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) showed an overall survival advantage, albeit with all the caveats of a retrospective analysis."
"An 83-year-old male presented with hematuria. CT scan  showed a 4-cm mass in the posterior bladder wall. He  underwent TURBT showing muscle-invasive urothelial  carcinoma, but had extreme difficulty with the anesthesia  postoperatively. He presents to your office and expresses  a desire for nonsurgical treatment. Which of the following  options will potentially result in the best disease-free sur - vival for treatment outcome",D,"Combined radiation and chemotherapy with mitomycin and 5FU. This patient has expressed a desire for nonsurgical intervention. Given the muscle invasive disease, intravesi cal treatment would be suboptimal. However, chemoradio therapy remains an option. The BC2001 trial enrolled 360 patients who were assigned in a phase III trial to undergo either chemoradiation (regimen of 5FU 500 mg/m2 per day during fractions 1–5 and 16–20 of radiation as well as mi tomycin 12 mg/m2 on day 1 or radiation alone). The loco regional disease free survival was superior in the combined chemoradiotherapy group at 67% compared with 54% for the radiation group ( P = .03). However, while overall sur vival did favor the chemoradiotherapy group, it was not statistically significant ( P = 0.16)."
"An 85-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because  of hematuria. A CT scan was ordered, which showed a  6-cm bladder wall mass along with retroperitoneal ad - enopathy and a focus in the liver that is indeterminate,  and 2 subcentimeter lung nodules. The patient was  taken to the operating room where a TURBT was per - formed and showed muscle-invasive urothelial carci - noma. You are then consulted. Upon your discussion of  treatment, the patient and his family would like to dis - cuss with you regarding news about promising results   with immunotherapy. You discussed with them the following:  ",A,"There is promising data regarding the use of PD L1 and PD 1 inhibitors in advanced/metastatic bladder cancer that is refractory to therapy. There is a proven role for immunotherapy in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer resistant to platinum therapy. A multiinstitutional phase II trial using atezolizumab an anti PD L1 inhibi tor, showed promising objective response rates for every specified immune cell group in the cohort of patients. The highest response rate of 27% was in the immune cell group (IC2/3) with 95% CI 19–37, P < .0001; and in all patients, regardless of their immune cell status, the response rate was 15% (95% CI 11–20, P = .0058). This has set the stage for all other PD 1/PD L1 inhibitors in the field of bladder cancer therapy where different drugs are being used for different settings, including that of patients who are con sidered cisplatin ineligible. Based on this trial, the US FDA has granted five immunotherapy drugs with accelerated approval in bladder cancer."
"A 61-year -old man was referred to you for a recently re - sected bladder cancer with the histology showing pre - dominantly squamous cell cancer. Upon further history,  you learn that he has been traveling to his home country  in Egypt. Which of the following infections are you most  concerned with",B,"Schistosoma haematobium . While the majority of histo logical subtypes of bladder cancer are urothelial cancers, squamous cell bladder cancer is common in areas where a parasitic infection, schistosomiasis, is endemic. Clonorchis is associated with cholangiocarcinoma. While there are in creasing reports of an association between HPV and blad der urothelial cancer, especially HPV16, this patient hails from and frequently visits an area endemic for schistoso miasis, which is more likely the consideration."
"A 50-year-old male patient with a recent diagnosis of blad - der cancer comes to you for a second opinion. He has read  new and emerging therapies as well as interesting genom - ic alterations in bladder cancer, and wonders how it ap - plies to him. You discuss with him about known genetic  alterations on bladder cancer:  ",E,"All of the above. Patients with urothelial carcinoma often have alterations in chromosome 9, which, when deleted, appears to be important for the initiation of bladder cancer. Other common alterations include p53 and Rb deletions, which are common in invasive bladder cancer, whereas mutations of FGFR3 are seen in noninvasive papillary can cers. A rare mutation in TSC1 had been described in a pa tient with bladder cancer for whom everolimus served as an effective targeted therapy using genome sequencing."
He insists on continuing treatment. You discuss with him  the following:  ,D,"Consider a clinical trial. At this time, continued supportive care as the standard of care would be ideal. If there is a clinical trial option that looks at the question of mainte nance, then it would also be appropriate. The question of maintenance after optimal treatment with chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease has been evalu ated with the use of sunitinib or lapatinib, but it has been shown to be negative. Continuing further with cisplatin when he already hasdeveloped renal dysfunction and neu ropathy would be inappropriate."
"A 63-year-old patient is being referred to you for a history  of penile cancer. He initially underwent penectomy, but fur - ther scans showed pelvic and retroperitoneal adenopathy  with two lung nodules that was biopsy-proven metastatic  penile cancer. He is being sent to you regarding considera - tion for chemotherapy. Which of the following would be the  next best step in management with this patient",D,"You would recommend cisplatin based chemotherapy such as TIP (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin). Penile cancers are rare genitourinary cancers that are usually squamous cell carcinomas in histology. Treatment for stage IV penile cancers (by definition those who have pelvic or retroperitoneal or distant metastases, such as this patient) usually entails cisplatin based chemotherapy with TIP be ing shown to be an active regimen. The use of bleomycin in these patients was discouraged because of toxicity. In pa tients with pelvic nodal disease alone, further consolida tive surgery or palliative radiotherapy may be considered if sufficient responses to chemotherapy are seen. However, finding stage IV disease in penile cancer portends an omi nous prognosis."
"A 61-year-old male patient was found to have hematu - ria. TURBT showed detrusor muscle involvement with  urothelial cancer in a papillary tumor, but with involve - ment of the prostate stroma. His CT scan imaging and  bone scan were negative. You discussed his case with the  tumor board and were asked to stage him. You assign him  the following clinical stage:  ",D,"Stage III. This patient has involvement of the prostatic stro ma, which elevates him to have a T4a disease, and based on the AJCC staging, this would be considered stage III disease.Bladder and Other Urothelial Cancers 177"
A 56-year-old male patient undergoes TURBT and is  found to have predominantly urothelial carcinoma with  a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma variant. He has  muscle-invasive disease. He is referred to you by the  urologist for recommendations. Which of the following  should you now recommend,A,"Neoadjuvant dose dense MVAC or gemcitabine/cispl atin followed by radical cystoprostatectomy and lymph node dissection. This patient presents with one of the rare urothelial carcinoma variants, urothelial carcinoma with a lymphoepithelioma like carcinoma variant. Certain reports had suggested a favorable prognosis if lymphoepithelioma like carcinoma was the predominant pattern, as chemo therapy seemed to yield favorable responses. Regardless, in patients with predominant urothelial carcinoma, even in the presence of a variant, treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains a reasonable approach, followed by surgery in patients who exhibit no metastatic disease."
A 62-year-old patient who underwent neoadjuvant chem - otherapy for 4 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin under - went radical cystoprostatectomy and was found to have  pT3 bladder cancer. He was referred to you by his primary  care physician since he had also seen a radiation oncolo - gist for consideration of adjuvant radiation. Which of the  following would you discuss regarding utility of adjuvant  radiation in his case,D,"Recommend observation. This patient was found to have persistent stage III disease but had already undergone ne oadjuvant chemotherapy. While a retrospective database based on the Retrospective International Study of Cancers of the Urothelium (RISC) showed possible benefit with the use of additional adjuvant chemotherapy for residual disease despite prior receipt of neoadjuvant chemother apy, this was a retrospective study, and there is no clear established role for further chemotherapy in the absence of overt metastatic disease. The subject of adjuvant radia tion is the topic of investigation that is launched by several groups including the NRG Oncology in North America and the French GETUG AFU, among others. While several small studies and retrospective data suggest potential ben efit, it remains an investigational approach at this time."
A 40-year-old male patient presents with superficial blad - der cancer. He asks you during his visit about the risk fac - tors of developing bladder cancer. Which of the following  in his medical history would you consider pertinent re - garding his risk for developing bladder cancer,E,"All of the above. Risk factors for bladder cancer has histor ically included smoking as one of the strongest risk factors, accounting for up to 50% of cases in developed countries. However, other risk factors, such as occupation exposures to aromatic amines, environmental exposures to arsenic, drugs like chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, uri nary tract infections, and schistosomiasis (for squamous cell bladder cancer), have also been implicated."
A 54-year-old male patient presents with pelvic pain and  hematuria. TURBT showed pure bladder adenocarcinoma.  What would be the next step in management,B,"Referral to gastroenterology for colonoscopy and endos copy; only proceed with radical cystoprostatectomy and lymph node dissection if negative. Primary adenocarci noma of the bladder is rare in the developed world, ac counting for about 1.4% of bladder cancers undergoing radical cystectomy. It is more prevalent in the develop ing world, accounting for up to 11%. It is the third most common bladder cancer, after urothelial cancer and squamous cell cancer. Primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder can be histologically classified as enteric, ad enocarcinoma not otherwise specified, signet ring cell, mucinous, clear cell, hepatoid, or mixed. It is crucial to rule out another primary source, such as that seen in the gastrointestinal tract. Hence, the importance of consult ing with gastroenterology."
"A 78-year-old patient with a history of small-cell bladder  carcinoma was referred to you by the radiation oncologist  for discussion regarding the role of PCI. He was found to  have muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma 2 months ago,  and on imaging had no adenopathy and no obvious me - tastases. His brain MRI was negative. He was started on  cisplatin and etoposide. Regarding your views on PCI, you  discuss with him the following:  ",D,There are no sufficient data to recommend PCI for ex trapulmonary small cell lung cancer at this time. This pa tient presents with an aggressive histological subtype of bladder carcinoma. Treatment is often extrapolated from the small cell cancer literature. Treatment with cranial ra diation would be appropriate for overt presence of meta static disease.
"A 58-year-old male African-American patient is referred to  you for a history of urethral cancer. At the end of the visit,  he asks you what risk factors he had that predisposed him  to develop urethral cancer and to prevent future recurrence.  You answer that the risk is associated with the following:  ",E,"All of the above. Urethral cancers are rare cancers that occur with a rate of 5.0 per million and 2.5 per million for African Americans and whites, respectively, accord ing to a SEER based dataset. The most common histologi cal subtype was transitional cell carcinoma occurring in about half the patients (55%), squamous cell carcinoma in 21.5%, and adenocarcinoma in 16.4%. There is varying incidence of the three primary histological types by race and sex."
"A 65-year-old male presents to you for another opinion  from the urologist. He presented initially with microscop - ic hematuria and was found on TURBT to have CIS. His  urologist recommends induction BCG × 6 treatments, and  upon repeat cystoscopy was found to have just erythema  in the bladder. You recommend the following:  ",B,"Observe for now and continue with maintenance BCG as planned. Intravesical BCG has been the cornerstone of treatment against CIS and is recommended as first line therapy based on the AUA and EAU guidelines, and maintenance therapy with BCG was demonstrated by the SWOG 8794 to be effective in CIS. Maintenance therapy is given as 3 weekly BCG treatments at 3 months, 6 months, and every 6 months intervals for up to 3 years. While radi cal cystectomy has been considered the de facto second line option for patients who fail BCG, this patient has not exhibited failure. This patient has erythema, which is like ly due to post induction BCG. In addition, taking random biopsies are no longer considered standard. Continuation of planned maintenance BCG would be recommended with surveillance cystoscopies."
"A 62-year-old male presents with right flank pain and  hematuria. He was found to have a 5 cm mass in the   renal pelvis on the CT scan, with evidence of perivesical  fat invasion on further MRI. Biopsy showed high-grade  urothelial carcinoma on biopsy. A renal Lasix scan showed  differential function of 50% on the left kidney and 50% on  the right kidney. He would like to be aggressive in treat - ing this cancer. Which of the following treatment options  would you discuss with the patient",C,"Consideration for neoadjuvant gemcitabine and cispl atin followed by radical nephroureterectomy with cuff of bladder resection. This patient presents with high grade urothelial carcinoma for which the standard of care remains as surgical resection with radical neph roureterectomy and bladder cuff resection, in patients who are otherwise candidates for surgery. However, there is increasing use and extrapolation from the blad der cancer data regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin or dd MVAC, similar to what would be used in muscle invasive bladder cancer for patients who are otherwise cisplatin eligible. There fore, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) would also recommend consideration for ne oadjuvant chemotherapy in those who are considered cisplatin eligible. BIBLIOGRAPHY"
1 ):  ,C,"This patient is presenting with a syndrome called heredi tary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). This syndrome is characterized by cutaneous leiomyomata, which occurs singly or multiply in the majority of individu als; for example, uterine fibroids in women, and RCC that is usually a single tumor.The RCC is typically papillary carci noma in character or a collecting duct tumor. These tend to be aggressive and occur in about 10%–16% of individuals. The pathogenic mechanism involves a loss of function of the FH protein with either germline pathogenic variant in FH, plus somatic variants and loss of heterozygosity in the tumor tissue. Conversely, clear cell kidney cancer is the typi cal RCC found in patients with VHL, whereas medullary cancers are seen in patients with sickle cell disease. While chromophobe kidney cancers can be seen in a hereditary fa milial syndrome called Birt Hogg Dubé (BHD) syndrome, which is characterized also by skin lesions. The cutaneous lesions are usually fibrofolliculomas (rather than leiomyo mas), pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and bilateral, multifocal RCC (rather than solitary in HLRCC). Oncocytomas can grow large and may be confused with clear cell RCC because of its eosinophilic cytoplasm, but it is still largely considered a benign neoplasm in the 2004 World Health Organization classification of benign tumors."
"A 70-year-old male presented with metastatic kidney can - cer to the lungs. He underwent treatment with sunitinib  for 12 months, but has started progressing with enlarge - ment of the target lesions. You discuss with him about  switching therapies. He asks you about the benefit of im - munotherapy in his situation. You tell him the following:  ",A,"Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against PD 1, and on November 25, 2015, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced kidney cancers that have failed one line of prior antiangiogenic therapy. In the pivotal phase III trial, Check mate 025, nivolumab was compared with everolimus in a second line setting and was found to be superior in overall survival with a median of 25 months in those who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kgIV q 2 weeks versus everolimus 10 mg daily. Response rates were greater with nivolumab at 25% versus 5% with everolimus (odds ratio: 5.98; [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.68–9.72]; P<.001). While the median PFS was not statistically significantly different, PFS with nivolumab was better at 4.6 months compared with 4.4 months with everolimus. Nivolumab, being a checkpoint inhibitor, showed immune related side effects, but overall grade III or IV treatment side effects occurred in 19% of patients on nivolumab versus 37% for those who received everolimus."
He presents to you for discussion  regarding primary treatment of metastatic kidney cancer.  You counsel him on the following:  ,D,"Treatment for metastatic/advanced kidney cancers, espe cially with a good Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic score, would be to use VEGF TKIs with either sunitinib or pazopanib. Everolimus is indicated as second line therapy after failure post TKI. In the COM PARZ trial, pazopanib was noninferior to sunitinib with respect to PFS (hazard ratio [HR] for progression of disease or death from any cause, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90–1.22), meeting the predefined noninferiority margin (upper bound of the 95% CI, <1.25). Overall survival was similar (HR for death with pazopanib, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.08). However, in terms of side effects, sunitinib had a higher overall incidence of fatigue (63% vs. 55%), hand foot syndrome (50% vs. 29%), and thrombocytopenia (78% vs. 41%); patients treated with pazopanib had a higher incidence of increased levels of ala nine aminotransferase (60% vs. 43% with sunitinib). When physicians and patients were polled on their preference af ter an innovative crossover design, the same pattern was seen in the PISCES trial, where significantly more patients (70%) preferred pazopanib over sunitinib (22%)."
"A 48-year-old African American male seeks medical  attention for a history of hematuria. His medical his - tory was significant for a history of sickle cell disease.  A computed tomography (CT) scan was done which  showed a 6-cm renal mass and metastatic involvement in the retroperitoneum, bone, and lungs. What histol - ogy is the most likely diagnosis",B,"Medullary RCC. While any renal cancer pathology may be seen in patients presenting with kidney mass, renal med ullary cancers are an epithelial malignancy that almost ex clusively occur in young black patients with the sickle cell hemoglobinopathy.

A 65-year-old female presents to you for a history of re - sected kidney cancer. She was found to have a 10-cm clear  cell RCC with Fuhrman grade IV . She had no evidence of  disease on restaging scans post-nephrectomy. Which of the  following is the most appropriate intervention,C,"Observation with surveillance scans monitoring for pro gression. Several adjuvant studies have been conducted in patients with high risk disease and have been found to be negative. Initial results from the ASSURE ECOG 2805 trial using adjuvant sorafenib versus sunitinib ver sus placebo showed no difference in terms of adjuvant therapy, making observation still the most appropriate approach for patients with optimally resected kidney cancers.Renal Cell Carcinoma 182"
A 49-year-old patient was recently diagnosed with a kid - ney mass. He underwent radical nephrectomy with pa - thology revealing pT2NxMx papillary RCC. Which of the  following statements is correct,B,"Type 1 papillary RCCs are typically associated with MET alterations. Type 1 and type 2 papillary renal cell carci nomas were shown to be different types of renal cancer characterized by specific genetic alterations. Type 1 tu mors were associated with MET alterations, whereas type 2 tumors were characterized by cyclin dependence kinase inhibitor ( CDKN)2A silencing, SETD2 mutations, TFE3 fu sions, and increased expression of the NRF2–antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway, as had been seen in The Cancer Genome Atlas network analyses. A CpG island methylator phenotype was observed in a distinct sub group of type 2 papillary RCC that was characterized by poor survival and mutation of the gene encoding FH."
The VHL gene has been characterized in a hereditary kid - ney cancer syndrome. Which of the following is true,E,"All of the above. VHL syndrome is one of the four major autosomal dominantly inherited kidney cancer syndromes characterized by germline translocations of the distal por tion of the short arm of chromosome 3, but it was initially described by Eugene von Hippel and later by Arvid Lin dau. Affected individuals have a predisposition to develop tumors involving the kidney, hemangioblastomas in the cerebellum, spinal cord or retina, involvement of the in ner ear, pancreas, epididymis, or pheochromocytomas of the adrenals. Of the patients with VHL studied, up to 60% may develop solid and cystic renal lesions in their lifetime, leading to the emergence of nephron sparing surgeries as a potential strategy for these patients."

A 78-year-old male with prior history of hypertension and  stroke came for consultation regarding a history of hema - turia and was found to have a 2-cm right kidney mass. His  urologist recommended a partial nephrectomy. The patient  is interested in this approach. You discuss that partial ne - phrectomy can generally be considered for the following:  ,C,"Sporadic clear cell RCC makes up the majority of histo logic subtype. RCC affects close to 39,000 patients in the United States in 2016 alone and causes close to 13,000 deaths annually. RCC forms a unique pathological entity that spans varying histologic subtypes with clear cell RCC as the most common, making up close to 75%, and papil lary RCC as the 2nd most common (type 1 pRCC making up 5% and type 2 pRCC at 10%), chromophobe and onco cytomas are rare with about a 10% incidence of all RCCs. While genetic mutations have been identified as an etiol ogy of inherited RCC, these only account for 1 2% of all RCC cases. Majority of sporadic RCCs (up to 80%) is of clear cell histology."
"He has recuperated well from surgery with  good performance status of ECOG 0, but on a restaging  scan was found to have multiple bilateral lung nodules.  You calculated his MSKCCprognostic factor for choice of  therapy. The factors you are considering that predict for  poor overall prognosis include the following:  ",A,"Hemoglobin of less than normal. The MSKCC or the Motzer criteria for poor prognosis was based on several pretreatment factors in metastatic RCC patients, which includes a low Karnofsky performance status (<80%), a high lactate dehydrogenase level (>1.5 times the upper limit of normal), a low hemoglobin level (less than the lower limit of normal), a high corrected serum calcium level (>10 mg/dL), and an absence of nephrectomy. The prognostic factors were used to categorize patients into favorable , intermediate , or poor risk groups with corre sponding median survival times of 20 months, 10 months, and 4 months, respectively."
"A 73-year-old patient presented with gross hematuria. He  underwent a CT scan, which revealed a 6-cm mass, mul - tiple retroperitoneal adenopathy, and lung nodules. He  declined further surgery after a biopsy revealed clear cell  RCC. He was found to have anemia, and high calcium and  LDH. He also has pain and anorexia. You discuss treat - ment options with him and state the following:  ",C,"He has poor risk disease; you recommend temsirolimus. Using the MSKCC/Motzer prognostic model, this patient is considered to have poor risk disease. The pivotal trial of temsirolimus versus interferon was evaluated in a phase III study involving 626 patients with previously untreated, poor prognosis metastatic RCC with the regimen of 25 mg of intravenous temsirolimus weekly or interferon alfa (at 3 million units with provision to increase to 18 million units) 3 times weekly, or combination therapy with 15 mg of temsirolimus intravenously weekly in addition to 6 mil lion units of interferon alfa 3 times weekly. Patients who received temsirolimus alone had a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (HR for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58–0.92; P =.008) and PFS ( P<.001) than did patients who received interferon alone. The median overall surviv al in the temsirolimus group was 10.9 months. Although high dose intravenous interleukin 2 can occasionally re sult in durable remission, it can be considered only in a se lect group of patients as it is a toxic treatment. Everolimus is approved as a second line treatment, as with nivolumab. While sunitinib also can be used in this setting, this patient is considered to have poor risk, rather than favorable risk, in the MSKCC prognostic criteria setting."
"A 59-year-old male who presented with metastatic kidney  cancer went on sunitinib and had stable disease for 1 year.  However, his last restaging scan showed progressive dis - ease. He asks you about cabozantinib. You discuss with  him the results of the METEOR study:  ",B,"Cabozantinib showed improvement in PFS compared with everolimus. The METEOR trial was a phase III trial that ex amined cabozantinib versus everolimus in the advanced/ metastatic kidney cancer population posttreatment with a VEGFR targeted therapy. The trial was positive, show ing improvement in the median PFS of 7.4 months with cabozantinib versus 3.8 months with everolimus, leading to cabozantinib’s approval on April 2016. The HR was 0.58 translating to a 42% reduction in the risk of progression or death with cabozantinib compared with everolimus (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45–0.75; P<.001). The objective response rate was also better with cabozantinib at 21% versus 5% with everolimus ( P<.001). While a planned interim analy sis showed that overall survival was longer with cabozan tinib than with everolimus (HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89; P=.005), it did not cross the significance bound ary for the interim analysis. Adverse events were fairly manageable with dose reductions occurring in 60% of the patients who received cabozantinib, and in 25% of those who received everolimus."
Which of the following best describes the use of tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced RCC,E,"All of the above. There are several currently available oral TKIs approved for first line treatment (sunitinib or pazopanib) as well as post failure of these drugs, which includes axitinib, cabozantinib, or lenvatinib with everoli mus combination. Cabozantinib is another oral TKI against VEGFR as well as MET and AXL, which was studied in comparison to everolimus in the second line setting."
"A 72-year-old female patient was admitted to the hos - pital for pancytopenia, failure to thrive, stomatitis, hy - percholesterolemia, shortness of breath, and cough. Her  physical examination was notable for hypoxemia. Her  chest x-ray is showing signs of interstitial pattern, and  the pulmonologist orders a high-resolution CT scan and  suspects pneumonitis after ruling out infection. The hos - pitalist contacted you to state that this patient has a diag - nosis of metastatic kidney cancer, but the patient does not  recall what drug she was on. Apart from counseling dis - continuation of the drug, you also recommended starting  the patient on steroids. Which drug is she likely on",E,"Everolimus. Varying therapies for metastatic kidney can cer have different drug toxicity profiles, which are impor tant to be aware of. The VEGF inhibitors have common side effects, including hypertension, hand foot syndrome, diarrhea, cytopenias, cardiac or thyroid abnormalities, and Renal Cell Carcinoma 183 possible bleeding or clotting problems. Everolimus, on the other hand, as a mTOR inhibitor, can result in cytopenias, hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia, and sto matitis, but a rare, yet life threatening, symptom could be pneumonitis. Noninfectious and nonmalignant pneumo nitis occurs in up to 9.9% of patients on everolimus. The decision for treatment depends on the severity of symp toms with patients having grade 1 (asymptomatic) mani festations could have continuation of treatment without dose adjustments. Grade 2 (symptomatic, affecting ADLs) may also lead to the continuation of treatment or a reduc tion of the dose. However, grade 3 (which involves severe symptoms that limit self care ADLs and oxygen require ments) as well as grade 4 (life threatening) manifestations necessitate withdrawal of the drug and a need to adminis ter corticosteroids after dose interruption."
A 56-year-old male was recently diagnosed with heredi - tary papillary kidney cancer. You are discussing his case  with medical students. You started discussing which  mutation is likely involved,B,"MET. This patient has papillary kidney cancer, which makes up the second most common histologic subtype of papillary cancer (type 1 pRCC making up 5% and type 2 pRCC at 10%). Specifically, the papillary type 1 tumors are associated with MET alterations, and is one of the four major autosomal dominantly inherited kidney cancer syndromes where individuals are at risk for developing multifocal and even bilateral tumors by the fifth or sixth decade of life, whereas type 2 tumors were characterized by CDKN2A silencing, SETD2 mutations, TFE3 fusions, and increased expression of the NRF2 ARE pathway. VHL syndrome is characterized by germline translocations of the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 3 and is associated with clear cell RCC. A recently described new RCC syndrome has been linked to germline muta tion of multiple subunits (SDHB/C/D) of the Krebs cycle enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase, where individual fam ily members developing a rare but seemingly aggressive type of clear cell kidney cancer has been described. While FLCN describes another syndrome, called BHD, the vast majority of the subtype of RCC seen in this syndrome is chromophobe or oncocytoma, and rarely of a papillary subtype, which only occurs in about 2% of patients."
A 62-year-old male patient comes to you for a second  opinion regarding his recently diagnosed metastatic pap - illary kidney cancer. He saw the results of a trial called  Everolimus Versus Sunitinib Prospective Evaluation in  Metastatic Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ESPN)  for non-clear cell RCC. He wonders if the trial results are  applicable to him. You discuss with him the following:  ,C,"The median overall survival with sunitinib use was slightly better than everolimus. The ESPN trial was a randomized phase II trial that examined the utility of sunitinib versus everolimus in improvement of PFS in first line therapy for non clear cell RCC. A total of 108 patients were needed to show improvement in median PFS (mPFS) from 12 weeks with sunitinib to 20 weeks with the use of everolimus. The trial was stopped early after analyses of the first 68 patients showed no statistically significant difference in the mPFS (the primary endpoint) of 6.1 months with suni tinib versus 4.1 months with everolimus ( P=.6). While the initial analyses showed improvement in overall survival with sunitinib, final overall survival analysis showed they were also not statistically significant but with slightly bet ter results with sunitinib at 16.2 months versus everolimus at 14.9 months ( P=.18). The trial findings showed only very modest efficacy that precluded a recommendation for the unanimous use of everolimus, which is currently ap proved as a second line treatment for non clear cell RCCs."
"A 66-year-old male patient was being treated with meta - static kidney cancer with sunitinib for 1 year. However,  upon restaging follow-up, he was found to have progres - sion of disease in his lung lesions. He and his family are  interested in immunotherapy. You describe the mechanism  of action of programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitors. Which of  the following is true regarding PD-1 blockade",B,"Blockade of PD 1 allows T cell re activation. The use of agents that therapeutically target the transmembrane protein PD 1 receptor or the ligand (PD L1) has met with success in the clinic. The varying expression patterns of both PD 1 and PD L1 are complex, with PD1 generally expressed on T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and some myeloid cells, while PD L1 is expressed on different nonhe matopoietic cells. PD 1 functions as an inhibitory receptor; therefore, the blockade of PD 1 enhances T cell re activation and the secretion of cytokines. It also induces the metabolic program and interaction with target cells. TReg cells may function as an inhibitor to the response of T effector cells. Therefore, the PD 1 blockade serves to relieve the suppres sion on effector T cells, but not necessarily further increase the expansion of thymic T cells."
The hospitalist consults you regarding an  opinion about management. Which of the following would  constitute the most appropriate management for this patient,C,"Active surveillance. Active surveillance is an increasingly recognized management approach, especially for those who refuse surgery, or those who are ineligible or otherwise suboptimal candidates for surgery. The reported incidence of progression to metastatic disease can be up to 2% of pa tients in retrospective and prospective studies. This patient has a recent diagnosis of comorbidities, including acute TIA and recent CAD. Any surgical procedures, including radical or even partial nephrectomy or cryoablation, would not be suitable. Starting sunitinib in the absence of meta static disease is also not recommended in this patient with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. BIBLIOGRAPHY"
5 cm. What is the next best step in  management,C,"Refer for RPLND for resection of the tumor. This patient pre sented with a mixed nonseminoma, stage IIB with good risk disease. He was treated with 3 cycles of BEP , and while his markers all came down to normal, his restaging scan showed persistent residual mass of greater than 1 cm in size. At this time, surgical resection would be the right course of action. Obtaining further PET CT scan would not add utility since even if this were not to be PET avid, one would still consider disease in the retroperitoneum that would warrant resection and teratomas may not be particularly PET avid and would need to be resected. Given negative markers and lack of con firmation that this is truly viable tumor, proceeding with sal vage TIP would not be optimal. Proceeding with 2 more cycles of BEP would be erroneous, as the patient already received the appropriate number of cycles of first line BEP therapy."
"1 ). His tumor mark - ers, including AFP and bhCG, were elevated. His AFP was  elevated to 60,300 ng/mL, bhCG was 185 mIU/mL, and  his LDH was normal. His scrotal ultrasound showed no  masses, and the CT of his abdomen and pelvis showed no  adenopathy. You counsel him regarding his risk of disease.  What is the most appropriate next step in management",C,"Treatment with 4 cycles of BEP . Primary mediastinal germ cell tumors (GCTs), especially extragonadal ones, are rare, have an aggressive course, and always fall in the poor risk category. Treatment with upfront BEP for 4 cycles for poor risk germ cell tumors remains the standard of care. However, there is increasing interest in looking at upfront TIP versus BEP in this intermediate or poor risk population of patients, knowing that their risk for failure with a standard dose of BEP is high. Similarly, a study evaluating conventionally dosed chemotherapy with BEP compared with BEP × 2 fol lowed by high dose therapy and transplant for a predomi nantly poor risk category of GCTs showed no improvement in overall or progression free survival. For patients requiring salvage therapy, another trial looking at a salvage standard dose of TIP versus high dose therapy followed by transplant is being evaluated by the Alliance trial (TIGER). Given that the patient is young, referral for treatment remains a reason able option rather than direct referral to a hospice, although there is no clear role for radiation only with mediastinal dis ease, except in a palliative setting."
"5 cm pure seminoma without rete testes in - volvement or lymphovascular invasion. He has a negative  abdominopelvic CT scan and chest x-ray, and his tumor  markers were within normal limits even pre-orchiectomy.  He plays the violin with the symphonic orchestra and is  concerned about experiencing any neuropathic side ef - fects. He states compliance will not be an issue. What is  the next best step in management",E,"He should be offered surveillance. This patient is diag nosed with a stage IA pure seminoma. Several proponents of risk adapted management of clinical stage I seminoma includes offering adjuvant carboplatin therapy for those Germ Cell Tumor 188 who have known risk factors, such as size of greater than 4 cm or rete testes involvement in seminomas. However, validation of these prognostic factors was equally disput ed. Regardless, surveillance would be the preferred option in this patient with no apparent risk factors."
He underwent a brain MRI and was found to have  a solitary parietal lesion. He proceeded with resection and  primary standard chemotherapy with BEP . Which factors  would predict worse overall survival in this patient with  brain metastasis,D,"Men with GCTs who present with brain metastases have poor overall survival. In an analysis from the global germ cell cancer group, data from 523 men who presented with primary or relapsed metastatic brain disease were found to have poor overall survival. However, the group of men who had brain metastases present at the initial diagnosis fared better than those who had it at relapse (OS at 3 years was 48% vs. 27%). Other independent adverse prognostic fac tors also included elevations of AFP greater than 100 ng/ mL and bhCG > 5000 mIU/mL, primary mediastinal non seminoma, and receipt of only single modality therapy."
5 cm with  markers all still within normal limits. What is the next  appropriate step,B,Continue surveillance. This patient was initially diagnosed with a stage II seminoma and was treated with standard doses of BEP ×
5-cm retroperitoneal mass and other  smaller sub-centimeter RP adenopathy. His tumor mark - ers showed the following,D,"RPLND with surgical resection of the retroperitoneal domi nant mass. This patient has a mixed nonseminoma, interme diate risk tumor, based on the International Germ Cell Cancer Consensus Group (IGCCCG) criteria. This patient had a good response to BEP with a decline in his tumor markers along with shrinkage of the known RP mass. Therefore, switch ing to TIP or performing high dose therapy and transplant would not be appropriate. The lung nodules and ground glass appearance likely were secondary to bleomycin toxicity. Obtaining a lung biopsy or resecting this would not be ben eficial. However, findings of a residual mass in a patient with negative markers would entail resection of the RP mass."
"A 38-year-old male patient presented with a testicular mass.  Radical orchiectomy of the left revealed a pure seminoma,  pathology T2 with lymphovascular invasion and size of 8  cm with rete testis involvement. He had negative disease on  staging scans and negative tumor markers. He comes for con - sultation regarding adjuvant therapy. You discuss the follow - ing regarding adjuvant therapy for stage IB seminoma:  ",B,"Recommendation for adjuvant radiation entails the use of 20 Gy of radiation. While some clinicians would advocate adjuvant treatment in a risk adapted manner, such as those patients who have increased size of greater than 4 cm or rete testes involvement, some discourage the risk adapted approach with surveillance being the main therapeutic ap proach in stage I seminoma patients. For patients who opt for adjuvant therapy, the principles of adjuvant therapy for pure seminoma includes consideration for 1 cycle of carbo platin AUC of 7 or radiation using 10 fractions of 2 Gy each, with equivalent relapse free survival rates for both groups."
A 35-year-old male presents with a 6-cm retroperitoneal  mass on CT scan after presenting with mild abdominal  pain. His history includes prior treatment with BEP 7 years  ago for a stage II mixed nonseminoma. His tumor markers  were not elevated. A biopsy of the mass reveals pathology  consistent with germ cell tumor. What would be the next  step in management,D,"Recommend surgical resection. Late relapse for nonsemino mas occurs in a minority of patients (about 2%–3%), and the behavior is often clinically different and aggressive. The pri mary sites of involvement include the retroperitoneum or the lungs, and AFP is the primary tumor marker that is elevated. While these tumors may remain chemotherapy sensitive, they rarely respond to or are cured with chemotherapy alone, and surgical resection would be considered the definitive therapy. Patients who were treated with surgical resection had a higher likelihood of being disease free compared with those who are treated with chemotherapy alone."
You  discuss the following treatment with him:  ,C,"Recommend chemotherapy with BEP × 3; he has stage IS disease. While his pathology on orchiectomy does show pT1 disease, which would put him at a stage IA, his post orchiectomy markers have not declined according to specified half lives, and the elevated markers at 6 weeks post orchiectomy are worrisome for persistent disease, despite a seemingly negative scan. Therefore, he would be best treated with systemic chemotherapy that follows good risk disease per the IGCCCG criteria."
A 27-year-old man recently diagnosed with testicular non - seminoma comes to you for consultation. He is concerned  about the etiology of his testicular cancer and the risk fac - tors associated with it. You discuss the following regarding  known risk factors for testicular cancer:  ,A,"His personal history of testicular cancer confers an increased risk of developing cancer in the contralateral testis. There are varying risk factors that contribute to the development of testicular cancer. Having had a personal history of testicular cancer results in a 12 fold increased risk, although this occurs in only approximately 2%–3% of all testicular cancer survi vors. Other risk factors include cryptorchidism, family history (though this may be confounded by a shared environmental history), intratubular germ cell neoplasia, race (highest among Caucasians and lowest among African Americans or Asians), environmental exposures, and infertility."
What is your next course of  management,D,Continue supportive therapy; repeat tumor markers and LFTs in a month. Patients who have a prior history of treat ed testicular cancer who present with isolated elevated AFP in the absence of any other signs or symptoms of re current testicular cancer has to be ruled out for conditions that could give rise to high AFP . Elevation of AFP could be secondary to hepatitis and it would be important to rule out this condition before starting them on salvage treat ment for relapsed testicular cancer.
"A 30-year-old white male was diagnosed with testicular  cancer and a mediastinal tumor that was biopsied to show  a germ cell tumor. He had elevated tumor markers with  AFP of 120 ng/mL and hCG of 75 mIU/mL, and LDH of  600 post-orchiectomy. He underwent chemotherapy with  BEP and after 2 cycles of chemotherapy had normalized  tumor markers. He went to an urgent care center as he  had a cold and cough and underwent a chest radiograph,  which showed an increased size of the tumor compared  with when he started, with some tracheal shift. His lung  fields were otherwise clear. Which is the ideal next step in  management",C,"Recommend surgical resection of the mass. Growing teratoma syndrome describes a rare phenomenon with a prevalence of 1.9%–7.6%, where patients with germ cell tumors could have enlarging sites of metastases despite an appropriate response to systemic chemotherapy with decline or even normalization of tumor markers. Histology of these lesions, once resected, often reveals benign teratomas, which are important to recog nize and resect given the nonresponse to chemotherapy."
"An 18-year-old patient with known Klinefelter syndrome  was referred to you by the Pediatrics section after he pre - sented with worsening symptoms of shortness of breath,  dyspnea, and cough. A chest radiograph and subsequent  CT scan reveals a large anterior mediastinal mass. He has Germ Cell Tumor 187 no wheezing on examination, but with pronounced gyne - comastia and lack of bodily hair. You obtained basic labo - ratory tests, all of which were negative. He is accompanied  by his parents who asked you what this mass could likely  be. You respond that it is likely related to the following:  ",C,"Mediastinal germ cell tumor. While several tumors may oc cur in the mediastinum, the anterior mediastinum is usu ally a site for lymphomas, including Hodgkin disease and non Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as thymoma or thymic cysts, and mediastinal germ cell tumors. Klinefelter syn drome, otherwise known as XXY, is characterized by two or more X chromosomes in males with varying physical, en docrine, and developmental manifestations. An association between a primary mediastinal germ cell tumor and Kline felter syndrome exists. In patients with a primary medias tinal germ cell tumor, about 20% had karyotypic findings suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome, which often occurs in young males (median of 15 years of age). The findings of a young median age (18 years), nonseminomatous subtype, and a mediastinal location of the germ cell neoplasm is typically characteristic of mediastinal germ cell tumors."
Which of the following is associ - ated with this karyotypic abnormality,A,"Germ cell tumor. An isochromosome of the short arm of chromosome 12 [i (12p)] has been reported to be a frequent Germ Cell Tumor 189 nonrandom chromosomal marker of germ cell tumors. This is present in about 80% of male germ cell tumors with evaluable cytogenetic abnormalities, and is found to have diagnostic and prognostic significance. An abnormal karyotype was more frequently seen in nonseminomatous tumors compared with seminomas. An alteration of one or more copies of i(12p), an excess 12p copy number, or a de letion on the long arm of chromosome 12 was found in as much as 25% of midline tumors of uncertain histogenesis in a study, thereby helping to establish diagnosis."
"5 cm mass in the retroperitoneum.  All his tumor markers are now negative. He asks you of  the likelihood that he would have a persistent, viable tu - mor if he were to undergo post-chemotherapy RPLND.  You answer him with the following:  ",D,"It is most likely necrosis around 50%, teratoma around 35%, or viable tumor around 15%. Post chemotherapy RPLND remains an important treatment modality for patients who undergo primary chemotherapy and have residual disease. Several series have found that the most common histology in post chemotherapy RPLND remains to be necrosis, in half of the cases. However, up to one third can have a tera toma and about 10%–15% can have a viable tumor."
"5 to 11 ng/ mL (normal of <8 ng/mL) with normal bhCG and LDH.  He also had been undergoing surveillance CT scans, which  showed no adenopathy and no change. You recommend  the following:  ",E,"Continue observation and surveillance. Persistently elevat ed AFP post cisplatin based chemotherapy have usually been considered a contraindication to surgery because of presumed presence of persistent, active, germ cell elements, and post chemotherapy RPLND is often reserved for those with negative markers and residual disease. On the other hand, second or third line chemotherapy is often recom mended after increasing serum tumor markers. However, this patient has neither residual disease on scans, nor per sistently increasing tumor markers. He has had persistently slightly elevated AFP with no indication of disease for the past 4 years now. In addition, there is the phenomenon of hereditary persistence of AFP , which may be considered, and for which no further active treatment is necessary."
A 25-year-old male with prior diagnosis 5 years ago with  stage II nonseminoma treated with primary chemotherapy  would like to go to the survivorship clinic. Which of the  following is true regarding surveillance and follow-up for  this patient,D,"The risk for a secondary malignant neoplasm still exists since he received chemotherapy. Patients with testicular cancer who undergo treatment with chemotherapy or ra diation therapy can incur risks of treatment, which include second malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity, pulmonary complications, hypogonadism, and nephrotoxicity. Therefore, continued long term follow up is essential in these patients."
Which of the following is true regarding infertility and tes - ticular cancers,E,"All of the above. The association between infertility and cancer is particularly strong for testicular cancer, with an increased risk in men with oligozoospermia, in those who have demonstrated decreased paternity, or in the setting of subnormal semen quality or CIS. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and counsel men for infertility even when they are diagnosed with testicular cancer. BIBLIOGRAPHY"
"A 45-year-old female has a history of stage II cervical can - cer, for which she was treated with cisplatin-based chem - oradiation. She has done well over the past 3 years, but  she re-presents now with vaginal bleeding. Her pelvic ex - amination shows a mass at the vaginal cuff, and a biopsy  confirms recurrent disease. She undergoes repeat staging,  and it unfortunately shows metastatic disease in her liver.  A biopsy of the liver confirms the presence of metastatic  squamous cell carcinoma, consistent with her primary cer - vical cancer. The most appropriate treatment for this pa - tient consists of:  ",D,"For patients with metastatic cervical cancer who have pre viously been treated with chemoradiation, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab affords a survival advantage, so the cor rect answer would be D. This was shown in Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial, which enrolled over 450 women with primary stage 4B cervical cancer or recurrent or persistent disease (all of whom were chemotherapy na ïve) and randomly assigned them to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Compared with chemotherapy alone, the incorporation of bevacizumab significantly improved overall survival by almost 4 months (16.8 vs. 12.9 months, respectively; P = 0.0132). Therefore, the cor rect option is cisplatin, paclitaxel, plus bevacizumab. For those who are not candidates for bevacizumab therapy, a separate trial conducted by the Japanese Gynecologic On cology Group (JGOG 0505) suggests that carboplatin plus paclitaxel is equivalent to cisplatin and paclitaxel and not as toxic. Hence, such patients can be spared the toxicity of cisplatin and proceed with carboplatin and paclitaxel."
"5  cm in size. After presentation at a multidisciplinary  tumor board, she undergoes surgical resection and  node staging. The final pathology shows a 6-cm squa - mous cell carcinoma of the vulva with evidence for  lymphovascular invasion. The margins are close, and  she has no evidence of pelvic-node metastases. Which  of the following statements about adjuvant therapy   applies",B,"She has multiple high risk factors for recurrence, includ ing large tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and close surgical margins. For these patients, the standard treatment consists of adjuvant RT (B). There are no rand omized trials to support this recommendation, but a large retrospective study that included more than 1600 patients reported that compared with no postoperative RT, adju vant RT was associated with a significant improvement in progression free survival (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.88). While it also improved overall survival at 3 years (57 vs. 51%, re spectively), this was not statistically significant. There are no data to inform the use of combined modality treatment in vulvar carcinoma. However, some experts prefer chemo radiation to RT alone as an extrapolation from the treatment of cervical cancer. In the absence of data, though, RT alone should be the standard treatment approach."
"A 67-year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding.  On direct questioning, she also reported a recent onset of  urinary frequency, often accompanied by pain. On pelvic  examination, a 5-cm mass was identified in the upper third  of the vagina. Examination of the inguinal node basins  showed bilateral inguinal adenopathy with nodes up to   3 cm in size appreciated. A biopsy of the vaginal mass con - firmed a primary vaginal squamous cell carcinoma and  a subsequent FNA of the left inguinal node was positive.  Which is the most appropriate next step in her manage - ment",B,"Of the listed options above, the most appropriate treatment is primary chemoradiation with 5 FU and/or cisplatin (B). Although only informed by low quality data, single insti tution studies consistently report improved locoregional control rates. As an example, one small study included 20 patients treated with RT alone versus 51 treated with chemoradiation. Compared with RT alone, patients treat ed with combined modality therapy had a higher 3 year disease free survival rate (73% vs. 43%, P = .011) and overall survival (79% vs. 56%, P = 0.037). Given the local extent of disease, surgical resection is not recommended as she would likely not achieve a complete resection. In general, chemotherapy has a limited role in vulvar cancer management, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy would only be appropriate on a clinical trial."
"5 cm in  size, and biopsy of this lesion showed a grade 3 squamous  cell carcinoma. She underwent surgery for cervical cancer,  and final pathology showed a deeply invasive cervical le - sion, 2 cm in size with evidence of lymphovascular space  invasion. There was no evidence of pelvic node invasion,  and surgical margins were negative. Which of the follow - ing is the most appropriate recommendation for adjuvant  treatment",A,"This patient meets Sedlis’ criteria for intermediate risk dis ease and should proceed with whole pelvic RT (A). The pre cise criteria include the presence of LVSI plus deep one third cervical stromal invasion and tumor of any size; presence of LVSI plus middle one third stromal invasion and tumor size ≥2 cm; presence of LVSI plus superficial one third stromal invasion and tumor size ≥5 cm; no LVSI but deep or mid dle one third stromal invasion and tumor size ≥4 cm. These criteria were used in a randomized trial of whole pelvic RT or no further treatment. Compared with follow up only, ad juvant RT resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence (RR = 0.53, P = .008). Because she has undergone hysterectomy, she is not able to have vaginal brachytherapy, which requires an intact cervix for placement of the brachy therapy device. While chemoradiation has shown benefits for more advanced disease, its role for women who meet Sedlis’ criteria is not yet clear, and an ongoing clinical trial being conducted by NRG Oncology hopes to address this is sue. Systemic chemotherapy is not utilized in patients with intermediate risk disease."
A 45-year-old woman underwent surgery with curative  intent for a 3-cm cervical cancer. Final pathology showed  that the parametria were microscopically involved and Gynecological Malignancies 198 3/17 pelvic nodes contained metastatic disease. She sees  you for treatment recommendations. What is your recom - mendation,C,"This patient meets Peters’ criteria for high risk cervical cancer. The precise criteria include positive surgical mar gins; pathologically confirmed involvement of the pelvic lymph nodes; and/or microscopic involvement of the parametrium. For women with high risk disease, adjuvant treatment consisting of chemoradiation is recommended; therefore, the correct answer is C. This is based on a trial in this population where over 100 women were randomly assigned to RT alone or RT with chemotherapy (consist ing of cisplatin and 5 FU). RT resulted in a significantly lower 4 year rate of progression free survival and overall survival. Because of toxicity, cisplatin is often used rather than cisplatin and 5 FU."
"A 39-year-old female was treated for early-stage cervical  cancer 2 years previously. At that time, she was diagnosed  with stage IB2 disease and received definitive chemoradia - tion using weekly cisplatin. She tolerated treatment with - out major side effects and then entered follow-up. She was  doing well, until she recently presented with pelvic pain  and intermittent spotting after intercourse. A pelvic exami - nation revealed a mass at the vaginal cuff that was fixed in  position. She had no evidence of lymphadenopathy. A bi - opsy of the mass was positive for recurrent cervical cancer  and subsequent staging with FDG-PET scan was negative  for metastatic disease. Treatment for this patient with cura - tive intent would entail:  ",A,"For patients with a central pelvic recurrence, as in this woman, curative treatment requires pelvic exenteration (A). The chance of cure (assuming resection to negative surgical margins and the absence of metastatic disease) approaches 50%. However, treatment is not without its risks, which include operative mortality of 3%–5% and Gynecological Malignancies 202 treatment related morbidity exceeds 50%. She is not a can didate for re irradiation after prior chemoradiation due to the risk of severe toxicities to normal tissue, and there is no curative role for chemotherapy in this circumstance."
"A 47-year-old woman is diagnosed with vaginal can - cer, stage I. She undergoes surgery and is told she  needs no further treatment. She enters surveillance and  wants to know about how this might have developed.  Which of the following is not a risk factor for vaginal   cancer",E,"Vulvar carcinoma shares the same risk factors as for cer vical cancer, including multiple lifetime sexual partners, early age at intercourse, and smoking. In addition, most vaginal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas and are likely mediated by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In one study that included almost 190 cases of invasive vaginal cancer, HPV DNA was detected in 74% of cancers with the highest detection rates in warty basaloid sub types of squamous cell carcinomas.

Which is the  most appropriate recommendation for this patient",E,"This patient has end stage vulvar cancer and should be referred for hospice and end of life care (E). Her perfor mance status disqualifies her from clinical trials and, in general, the role for chemotherapy in vulvar cancer is exceedingly limited. While treatment with chemothera py plus bevacizumab, vinorelbine, and then pemetrexed represent reasonable extrapolations of data on their role in the management of metastatic cervical cancer, there are no data to inform the benefits of continuing with treatment after progression on multiple lines of therapy. Her symp toms are also systemic, which makes it unlikely that there is a reasonable target for treatment with radiation therapy."
"A 60-year-old woman presented with abdominal bloating  and pelvic pain. On exam, she had obvious abdominal  distention and a sense of fullness in the pelvis, though no  discrete mass was identified on pelvic exam. A subsequent  CT scan showed a large uterine mass but no other findings.  Therefore, she underwent surgical staging, including a total  abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,  and pelvic and para-aortic node dissection. The final pa - thology showed a deeply invasive serous carcinoma of the  uterus. There was evidence of pelvic and para-aortic node  involvement with 3/10 pelvic and 2/12 para-aortic nodes positive for metastatic disease. What do you recommend as  adjuvant therapy",D,"This patient has stage IIIC endometrial cancer with serous histology and is at high risk for recurrence and death from disease. Therefore, she requires chemotherapy. The current standard treatment utilizes carboplatin and paclitaxel (D), which was shown to be as effective and better tolerated than the three drug combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel in a randomized clinical trial. While some clinicians favor multimodality treatment, there are no prospective randomized trials that show it is superior to chemotherapy alone."
"A previously healthy 68-year-old female underwent hys - terectomy for a uterine mass. The final pathology revealed  a leiomyosarcoma, which was confined to the uterus. She  is worried about dying from this tumor and seeks your  opinion regarding adjuvant therapy. Which of the follow - ing do you recommend",A,"The most appropriate answer is A. This patient has a stage I uterine leiomyosarcoma, and there are no data to inform the benefits of any treatment versus the almost certain tox icities. Doxorubicin was compared with no further treat ment in one trial; patients treated with doxorubicin had a lower recurrence risk, but this treatment showed no ben efit in either progression free or overall survival. Docetax el and gemcitabine has been evaluated in a phase II trial (n = 25) and reported a 3 year progression free survival rate of 59%. However, there was no control arm; hence, it is not possible to conclude that it should be standard of care. Final ly, RT has no role in the adjuvant context. This was shown in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial"
A 66-year-old female presents with pulmonary metasta - ses. She has a history of stage I leiomyosarcoma for which  she underwent a total hysterectomy 5 years previously. A  biopsy of her lung metastasis was consistent with uterine  leiomyosarcoma. What is her next best step,A,"For patients with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, the first line treatment of choice is docetaxel and gemcitabine (A). This is based on a phase II trial from the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG 87L) that included 42 women. Docetaxel and gemcitabine resulted in an overall response rate of 36%. Doxorubicin is a reasonable alternative to docetaxel and gemcitabine, but it is usually reserved for the second line setting. Carboplatin has minimal activity in sarcoma and plays no role in treatment of leiomyosarcoma. Trabectidin is approved for use in leiomyosarcoma following disease progression on doxorubicin; hence, is often used in third line treatment."
"A 42-year-old woman presented after having a seizure at a  mall. Head CT showed a solitary lesion in her left parietal lobe.  Bloodwork showed an elevated hCG >1,000,000 mIU/mL.   Pelvic ultrasound was negative for pregnancy, but it did re - veal an 8-cm uterine mass and bilateral ovarian theca-lutein  cysts. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed two liver  lesions measuring 2 and 3 cm, respectively, and at least four  lung metastases, measuring 1–2 cm in size. Per her husband,  she had undergone a D&E for an early second trimester preg - nancy loss about 7 months previously. He recalled the doctor  telling him that the placenta was “very abnormal.” Based on  the picture, she was diagnosed with GTN stage IV . What is  the most appropriate treatment for this patient",A,"This patient has a grade 2 endometrioid cancer with less than 50% myometrial invasion, consistent with stage IA endometrial cancer. These patients do not generally re quire lymph node dissection given that their risk of nodal metastases is no higher than 5 percent. As a result of their excellent prognosis, no adjuvant therapy is required and the correct answer is that she should proceed with surveil lance (A). While radiation therapy (RT) can reduce the risk of a local recurrence, there is no improvement in overall survival outcomes, since as stated above, the outcomes are excellent already with surgery alone. In addition, both pelvic RT and vaginal brachytherapy carry small toxic ity risks, including a higher risk of secondary malignan cies with pelvic RT13 and an increase in GU complications (e.g., dysuria, frequency, and incontinence) with vaginal brachytherapy.14"
"A 60-year-old woman has a history of a stage IB endome - trial cancer, endometrioid type, for which she underwent  adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). She did well until this past  month, when she developed abdominal bloating. A work-up   was pursued, which included CT scan of the chest, abdo - men, and pelvis. Unfortunately, this revealed omental carci - nomatosis and ascites. A biopsy of the omental disease was  consistent with recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  She is not a surgical candidate and hence, is sent to you for Gynecological Malignancies 199 treatment recommendations. Given she has never received  chemotherapy in the past, your recommendation is:  ",A,"The most appropriate treatment for this patient is carbopl atin and paclitaxel (A). The data to support its use comes from Gynecologic Oncology Group trial 209 (GOG 209), which randomly assigned 1300 women to carboplatin and paclitaxel or to cisplatin, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin (TAP).17 Compared with TAP , carboplatin and paclitaxel resulted in a similar overall response rate (51% in both arms), median progression free survival (13 months), and overall survival (37 vs. 40 months). However, carboplatin and paclitaxel was significantly less toxic, with much lower neuropathy rates (19 vs. 26%), thrombocytopenia (12 vs. 23%), and GI side effects (6 vs. 13%)."
A 66-year-old female presents with pulmonary metasta - ses. She has a history of stage I leiomyosarcoma for which  she underwent a total hysterectomy 5 years previously. A  biopsy of her lung metastasis was consistent with uterine  leiomyosarcoma. What is her next best step,A,"For patients with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, the first line treatment of choice is docetaxel and gemcitabine (A). This is based on a phase II trial from the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG 87L) that included 42 women. Docetaxel and gemcitabine resulted in an overall response rate of 36%. Doxorubicin is a reasonable alternative to docetaxel and gemcitabine, but it is usually reserved for the second line setting. Carboplatin has minimal activity in sarcoma and plays no role in treatment of leiomyosarcoma. Trabectidin is approved for use in leiomyosarcoma following disease progression on doxorubicin; hence, it is often used in third line treatment."
"A 32-year-old female presents with bleeding after intercourse.  On pelvic examination, she has a 5-cm cervical lesion, which  is friable and bleeds easily on palpation. A biopsy shows a  high-grade squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Pelvic MRI  confirms a bulky cervical cancer extending into the posterior  wall of the uterine body ( Fig. 27B.1 ). A staging FDG-PET scan  shows no evidence of lymphadenopathy or metastatic dis - ease. Your recommendation for treatment consists of:  ",B,"This patient presents with a stage IB cervical cancer. For these patients, definitive treatment consists of chemo radiation using weekly cisplatin (B). Compared with RT alone, chemoradiation results in a 30% relative reduction in the risk of death, 34% reduction in the risk of disease progression, 41% reduction in the risk of a local recurrent, and an almost 20% reduction in the risk of a distant recur rence. Given her large cervical cancer, radical hysterecto my would likely show evidence of parametrial invasion or positive margins, and this would require use of adjuvant chemoradiation in the adjuvant setting that would subject Gynecological Malignancies 203 her to significant risk for treatment related toxicities. Neo adjuvant chemotherapy is not utilized in such a scenario when chemoradiation can be offered with curative intent. If used, however, the proper surgery for invasive cervical cancer consists of a radical hysterectomy. While bevaci zumab is an active agent in cervical cancer, the data sup port its use in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel as a first line treatment for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer."
"A 56-year-old woman comes to you for a second opinion.  She has been diagnosed with a stage II vulvar carcinoma  and has recovered well from her surgical procedure 6 weeks  previously. On review of pathology, she had excision of a  3-cm vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, the margins were  clear, and there was no evidence of lymphovascular inva - sion. However, she only had a sentinel node biopsy, which  was negative (0 of 3 nodes). Regarding further nodal evalu - ation, the most appropriate recommendation would be:  ",A,"For patients with vulvar cancer who undergo surgical resection and have a negative sentinel node biopsy, no further nodal evaluation is required (A). A 2005 system atic review lends support to this recommendation, with a pooled sensitivity of 97% with technectium and 95% with blue dye. In contrast, other tests for nodal evalua tion (including imaging) had poorer sensitivities, rang ing from 45% to less than 90%. If she had not undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or if the technical capabilities to perform it were not available, the stand ard approach would be inguinofemoral lymphadenec tomy. A repeat SLNB is never performed, and given her final pathologic findings, she does not require adjuvant treatment."
"A 58-year-old woman has been diagnosed with recurrent  vulvar cancer. Her prior treatment consisted of surgical re - section and bilateral inguinofemoral node dissection, after  which she received adjuvant RT based on high-risk path - ologic features. It has been 15 months since end of treat - ment, and she is found with recurrent disease involving  the residual vulva. A multidisciplinary tumor board has  recommended she proceed with re-excision. Prior to sur - gery, she should undergo:  ",E,"Patients with recurrent vulvar cancer should undergo full body imaging to rule out distant metastases, which are present in up to 15% of these patients. Of the imaging modalities listed, the appropriate one is E. While the data regarding PET is limited in metastatic vulvar cancer, data in preoperative staging and radiation therapy planning for women with vulvar cancer shows that it has a high speci ficity of 95% and is better at identifying extranodal disease rather than disease in lymph nodes."
A 67-year-old woman is referred for a newly diagnosed  vulvar melanoma. She initially presented with nonspecific  discomfort and vulvar itching. Examination showed a pig - mented lesion involving the labia minora. She underwent  surgery and was ultimately diagnosed with a T2aN0M0  melanoma (stage IB). She wants to know more about this  disease. Which of the following are true statements about  vulvar melanoma,E,"All of the above (E). Only 644 cases of vulvar melanoma were identified within the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 1973 and 2003, which is a testament to the rarity of these diseases. The average age of diagnosis is 60 years, with median be tween 54 and 68. However, there are case reports of vul var melanoma being diagnosed in girls as young as"
"A 75-year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding, and  a biopsy showed a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  She also underwent full surgical staging, including a total  abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorecto - my, pelvic and para-aortic node dissection. The final pa - thology showed a grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma with  evidence of lymphovascular invasion. The tumor was also  deeply invasive to the myometrium. Her lymph nodes  showed no evidence of malignancy. What do you recom - mend as adjuvant therapy",B,"This patient meets criteria for intermediate risk endo metrial cancer. One classification comes from the Gy necologic Oncology Group (GOG) and based on age and any of three pathologic factors: deep myometrial invasion, grade 2 or 3 histology, or the evidence for lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI). Intermediate risk is characterized by the presence of any one factor in women 70 years and older; two risk factors in a woman 50–69 years; and all three factors in women 18–49 years. Patients with an intermediate risk endometrial cancer should proceed with vaginal brachytherapy (B). RT is associated with a reduction in the risk of local recur rence compared with surveillance alone (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21–0.83) though there is no associated improve ment in overall survival. The seminal Post Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Cancer (PORTEC 2) trial provides justification for the use of vaginal brachy therapy rather than whole pelvic RT. In this trial, there were no differences in recurrence free survival, rate of distant metastases, or 5 year survival outcomes. How ever, vaginal brachytherapy resulted in lower rates of treatment related toxicity, including diarrhea."
"A 70-year-old woman has metastatic uterine leiomyosar - coma, having progressed on docetaxel and gemcitabine  and then on doxorubicin. She maintains an excellent per - formance status and desires further treatment. What do  you recommend",E,"All these options represent reasonable options for this patient. Eribulin was evaluated in a phase III trial against dacarbazine for patients with soft tissue leiomyosarcoma or adipocytic sarcoma. All patients had received at least two prior lines of therapy. Compared with dacarbazine, eribulin resulted in a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS, 13.5 vs. 11.5 months, respectively; P = .0169), although there was no statistically significant difference in progression free survival (PFS, 5 vs. 2 months). Demetri et al. reported the phase III results comparing tra bectidin to dacarbazine in patients with previously treated liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. Compared with dacar bazine, trabectidin resulted in a significant improvement in PFS (4.2 vs. 1.5 months, P < .001) though no benefit was reported in OS (median 12.4 vs. 12.9 months, P = .37). Finally, pazopanib was compared to placebo in a phase III trial for patients with non adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma. Compared with placebo, there was a statistically signifi cant benefit associated with pazopanib in terms of PFS (4.6 vs. 1.6 months, P < 0.0001) but not in OS (12.5 vs. 10.7 months, P = 0.25). Hence, the lack of an overall survival advantage with any of these therapies makes the option for supportive care an option. In addition, it is entirely rea sonable to offer palliative care even if she opts to proceed with third line therapy."
"A 20-year-old female had undergone a dilatation and cu - rettage for molar pregnancy 10 months ago. Her hCG had  normalized as expected but most recently started to rise  once more and increased exponentially from 15 to 1725  mIU/mL. Her exam showed an enlarged uterus but no  other findings. This prompted a pelvic ultrasound that  showed a 6-cm, complicated uterine mass. What further  studies are required to formally stage this patient",A,"This patient has gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which is diagnosed by her history of mole and re elevation of her hCG level. GTN is staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system:  Stage I—Persistently elevated human chorionic gon adotropin (hCG) levels; tumor confined to the uterine corpus  Stage II—Tumor outside of the uterus, but is not be yond the pelvis and/or vagina  Stage III—Pulmonary metastases with or without uter ine, pelvic, or vaginal involvement. Note: Detection of pulmonary metastases is determined by chest x ray, not chest CT scan  Stage IV—Metastatic disease beyond the lungs and pel vis and/or vagina In addition to FIGO staging, a risk score is assigned using the World Health Organization (WHO) Prognostic Scoring System ( Table 27.2 ), which considers eight factors: age, antecedent pregnancy, interval from last pregnancy, pretreatment serum hCG level (taken from the most recent rise), site of metastases, number of metastases, and prior systemic therapy administered. Imaging of GTN requires a pelvic ultrasound and a chest x ray (A). Other imaging is indicated based on the re sults of these two studies. If the chest x ray is negative, she will not require additional imaging, especially since her pelvic exam was negative for vaginal extension of disease. Importantly, lesions suspected of being GTN should not be biopsied as this carries high risk of hemorrhage.Gynecological Malignancies 204"
"A 32-year-old woman presents with excess vaginal bleeding  over the past 2 weeks, with onset 6 months after a normal  spontaneous vaginal delivery. A pelvic ultrasound showed  a thickened endometrium, which prompted a dilatation and Gynecological Malignancies 200 curettage. Pathology from that procedure showed endome - trial proliferation and evidence of intermediate trophoblast  cells ( Fig. 27B.2 ). hCG was elevated to 400 mIU/mL and  subsequent staging CT of the chest and abdomen showed  at least five pulmonary lesions greater than 2 cm in size. She  was taken for a total abdominal hysterectomy due to bleed - ing, and the final pathology showed a diffuse infiltration of  intermediate trophoblasts between muscle fibers and vascu - lar channels. The cells diffusely stained positive for human  placental lactogen (hPL) but less so for hCG. Immunohis - tochemistry was positive for alpha-inhibin and cytokeratin  8/18, but it was negative for smooth muscle markers. These  characteristics are most consistent with:  ",D,"The presentation, relatively low hCG level (in consid eration of the diffuse disease) and immunohistochemical stains (particularly for hPL), is consistent with a diagnosis of placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). These tumors are more chemoresistant than other forms of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN); hence, both surgery and chemotherapy are the mainstays of treatment. Complete moles are typically hydropic diffusely and surrounded by hyperplastic trophoblasts. These tumors carry two sets of parental chromosomes (46XX or 46XY) and do not contain scalloping chorionic villi. In contrast, partial moles have scalloped chorionic villi and have an extra set of chromo somes attached (69XXY or 69XXX). Choriocarcinoma is made of sheets of anaplastic cytotrophoblasts and synciti otrophoblasts and is absent of chorionic villi. The absence of smooth muscle markers essentially rules out uterine sarcoma."

Which of the following  are indicative that she has a uterine leiomyosarcoma,E,"There are no features on imaging that reliably distinguish a leiomyoma from a uterine sarcoma. Features sugges tive of sarcoma on ultrasound, such as mixed echogenic ity, central necrosis, and irregular vessel distribution, may also be found in leiomyomas.18 In addition, the size of the mass does not reliably predict a uterine sarcoma. Finally, CT scan does not reliably differentiate a sarcoma from a leiomyoma. While the mean age at diagnosis of a uterine sarcoma is 60, these tumors can arise in women as young as 20 years. Hence, age should not be used to predict the presence of sarcomas of the uterus."

The most common molecular alteration seen in cutaneous  melanoma involves which of the following genes,D,"Somatic mutations are the most common molecular al teration in cutaneous melanoma, with the majority being V600E located in exon 15. The single amino acid substi tution of valine by glutamic acid in this mutation results in constitutional activation of the MAP kinase pathway causing cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Lesser common variants at BRAF V600 have also been identified. Mutations in NRAS occur in about 22% of cutaneous mela noma, while KIT mutations are seen more commonly in acral lentiginous and mucosal melanomas."
Which of the following is true regarding the cyclin- dependent  kinase inhibitor 2A ( CDNK2A ) gene in melanoma,E,"All of the listed statements are correct. The CDNK2A gene is located on chromosome 9p21 and encodes for two tumor suppressor proteins, p16 and p14. It is a highly penetrant predisposition gene, and the risk for developing melano ma in a mutation carrier is as high as 67% by age 80 years."
"3 mm Breslow  depth, ulcerated, and with brisk tumor infiltrating lympho - cytes. What is the appropriate next step in management",A,"The appropriate next step in management of an interme diate thickness melanoma without clinical evidence of nodal metastatic disease is wide excision with adequate margins plus sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy. Prospective surgical trials in melanoma have shown that 2 cm margins are adequate for tumors with Breslow thickness greater than 2 mm without any difference in lo cal recurrence or OS when compared with surgery with wider margins than 2 cm. Only one study from the UK has demonstrated improvement in melanoma specific survival but not in OS for surgical margin resection of 3 cm compared with 1 cm for tumors greater than 2 mm in depth. However, whether this is superior to a 2 cm mar gin is not known and thus has not been considered to be practice altering."

High dose interferon is also approved for melanomas thicker than 4 mm without nodal involvement. The other listed op tions are not approved at this time, although trials exam ining their efficacy in the adjuvant setting are ongoing or have completed accrual.

What would you  recommend at this time",E,"Toxicity is common with the use of adjuvant interferon in melanoma. Most commonly manifest as flu like symp toms, fatigue, myelosuppression, elevated liver enzymes, thyroid dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in cluding depression. Approximately 50% of patients in the original Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trials of adjuvant interferon required dose interruption or dose reduction. Liver toxicity is common and needs close vigilance during administration. For grade 3 elevation in transaminases (as in this case), treatment should be held until resolution with resumption at 50% dose attenuation per the approval labeling for this agent. An alternate ap proach based on the cumulative ECOG/Intergroup expe rience is 33% dose reduction upon resolution of toxicity. A second occurrence of a dose limiting toxicity would war rant dose reduction by 66% compared with baseline, while a third occurrence would mandate discontinuation of in terferon therapy."

In the phase III TROG 02.01 trial, 250 patients with palpable nodal disease (at presentation or at relapse; and without distant metasta ses) were randomized to receive adjuvant radiation or observation. There was significant improvement in local control with radiotherapy (adjusted hazard ratio 0.52, P = .023) but no difference in RFS or OS. This observation is also supported by retrospective data. There was signifi cant increase in lower limb volumes with radiotherapy compared with placebo secondary to lymphedema ( P = .014).

What is the next appropriate step in  management",E,"After confirmation of the diagnosis of metastatic mela noma, it is important to assess the tissue for potentially actionable mutations such as BRAF and KIT. The latter is found more commonly in acral and mucosal melanomas (∼20%) and may lend itself to intervention with KIT target ing agents such as imatinib. Brain imaging must be per formed at baseline for newly diagnosed metastatic mela noma due to the high propensity of melanoma to spread to the central nervous system. Serum LDH is an important adverse prognostic marker and is incorporated into the staging of metastatic melanoma."
5 cm). He is asymptomatic. Brain imaging does  not reveal metastatic disease. Molecular analysis reveals a  BRAF V600K mutation. All of the following are appropri - ate options for first-line therapy except:  ,A,"Ipilimumab was approved for therapy naïve metastatic melanoma in 2011 as the first agent to improve survival in this setting. However, randomized trials conducted since then have rapidly established anti PD1 based therapy as the standard first line option, either singly (pembroli zumab or nivolumab) or in combination with ipilimumab (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) based on improvements in response rate, PFS, and/or OS. As this patient’s tumor is BRAF V600K mutant, combination targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors is also an appropriate first line choice. Mutations in BRAF V600K are far less frequent than V600E but lend themselves to therapeutic inhibition by inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway. The approved combinations are dabrafenib plus trametinib or vemu rafenib plus cobimetinib."

This is a common side effect of combi nation immunotherapy using these agents, and any grade diarrhea was reported in 44% of patients treated with this regimen in the phase III Checkmate 067 trial. The incidence of grade 3–4 diarrhea was 9.3%. The most appropriate step in the management of this patients’ grade 3 diarrhea is prompt institution of high dose steroids (equivalent of prednisone 1–2 mg/kg per day) along with appropriate supportive care including fluid resuscitation, bowel rest (in select cases), and excluding an infectious etiology such as clostridium difficile colitis (where clinical suspicion ex ists). For cases nonresponsive to steroids, other immuno suppressants such as infliximab should be given (provided there is no evidence of gastrointestinal perforation).Melanoma and Other Skin Cancers 211"
Which of the following are common toxicities associated  with the administration of high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2),E,"High dose IL 2 causes a capillary leak syndrome that contributes to many of its toxic effects. Common adverse events include fever, chills, nausea, emesis, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria, elevated creatinine, hyperbiliru binemia, peripheral edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and pul monary congestion. High dose IL 2 requires appropriate cardiopulmonary screening for eligibility and has the po tential to induce durable responses in a small percentage of patients (less than 10%)."
Which of the following is true regarding the use of com - bination ipilimumab and nivolumab in advanced mela - noma,C,"The combination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab was first approved in 2015 for unresectable or metastatic mela noma that did not harbor a BRAF V600 mutation. This indication was expanded in 2016 to advanced melanoma regardless of the BRAF status of the tumor. In Check mate 067, the combination improved the response rate and PFS compared with ipilimumab. However, an effect on OS has yet to be reported from this phase III study. In a previous randomized phase II trial comparing the combination with ipilimumab, the OS at 2 years with the former was numerically higher than with ipilimumab alone (63.8% vs. 53.6%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. More than half the patients on the ipilimumab arm received subsequent anti PD1 therapy upon progression in this trial. Responses to checkpoint inhibitors have been seen in melanoma tumors with and without PD L1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Hence, the use of this test to ascertain eligibility for com bination anti CTLA4 and anti PD1 blockade in melanoma is not recommended."
Which of the following mutations are common in primary  uveal melanoma,A,Mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 occur in approximately 83% of uveal melanomas. This results in activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Other listed mutations are distinct ly uncommon in uveal melanoma. The BRCA1 associated protein 1 ( BAP1 ) is another common mutation reported in uveal melanoma and is associated with high risk of metas tases.
A 58-year-old female with melanoma of the right calf and  metastatic adenopathy in the pelvic and retroperitoneal  nodes was treated with nivolumab for 7 months before de - veloping clear evidence of disease progression in the nodal  basins plus new metastatic disease in the lungs. She is in good health otherwise. Next-generation sequencing of her  tumor does not reveal any mutations. What would you  consider for second-line therapy,A,"Options for patients with BRAF wild type metastatic melanoma progressing on anti PD1 therapy are limited. In the absence of a mutation in BRAF V600, vemurafenib, cobimetinib, or trametinib would not be indicated. Ipili mumab as a single agent is the most appropriate choice in this case. In a randomized phase II trial of planned sequencing of nivolumab for 12 weeks followed by ip ilimumab for 12 weeks or the reverse sequence (both fol lowed by maintenance nivolumab), the response rate and OS was higher in the former schedule. Prospective data on combination ipilimumab with an anti PD1 agent after progression on single agent anti PD1 therapy are lacking at this time."
4  times upper limit of normal). Brain MRI is normal. Molec - ular analysis confirms the presence of BRAF V600E muta - tion. What would you recommend as first-line therapy for  this patient,D,"This is a young patient with symptomatic metastatic melanoma and an elevated LDH, which is a poor prog nostic marker. Of the listed options, combined inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway with vemurafenib plus co bimetinib is the appropriate choice as first line therapy. Combination BRAF and MEK inhibition has a higher re sponse rate compared with single agent BRAF inhibitor therapy, and improves PFS and OS. In the phase III co BRIM trial, the median PFS for combination vemurafenib plus cobimetinib was 12.3 months compared with 7.2 months with vemurafenib plus placebo (hazard ratio 0.58; P < .001). Similarly, median OS was also improved from 17.4 months to 22.3 months with the combination (HR 0.70; P = .005). Similar results have been reported for combina tion dabrafenib plus trametinib versus dabrafenib alone. This reinforces that a BRAF inhibitor should no longer be used as a single agent in metastatic melanoma unless there a contraindication exists for combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy. Responses to the combination are often rapid leading to symptomatic improvement. While the combination of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib plus atezolizumab has demonstrated excellent preliminary ef ficacy in a phase 1b trial in advanced melanoma, its use remains investigational at this time and cannot be rec ommended outside of a clinical trial. A phase III trial of this triplet combination compared with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib has been initiated. The combination of ipili mumab and vemurafenib was shown to have a high rate of hepatotoxicity and should not be used."

Multidisciplinary discussion  deems this mass to be unresectable at this time. Which of Melanoma and Other Skin Cancers 209 the following systemic options would you consider for this  patient as first-line treatment",A,"Identification of the critical role of the Hedgehog signal ing pathway in the genesis of BCC has permitted the de velopment of targeted inhibitors of Smoothened homolog (SMO), with resultant inhibition of the Hh pathway. There are two approved oral agents for locally advanced or met astatic BCC—vismodegib and sonidegib. In an open label international trial, the response rate in BCC to vismodeg ib was 66.7% for locally advanced disease and 37.9% for metastatic BCC. Complete responses were observed in ap proximately half of the locally advanced cases. Common side effects associated with vismodegib include muscle spasms, dysgeusia, anorexia, fatigue, and alopecia. Trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors in nonmelanoma cutane ous cancers are ongoing. Cetuximab targets the epidermal growth factor receptor and has activity in cutaneous SCC. Bevacizumab is an inhibitor of VEGF and has no role in the management of advanced BCC outside of a clinical trial."

What is the most  likely histological diagnosis",C,"This is a typical clinical and histological appearance for MCC. This most closely resembles a high grade neuroen docrine carcinoma of the skin with small, round, basophilic cells, often with frequent mitotic figures. The perinuclear dot like pattern for CK 20 staining is typical for MCC and seen in 80%–90% of these tumors ( Fig. 28.3 ). These tumors are often dermal based with involvement of the subcu taneous tissue. They have a high propensity for regional nodal and disseminated metastases."
"The patient in Question 23 undergoes wide excision  of the primary tumor on the thigh along with senti - nel lymph node mapping and sampling. One of three  lymph nodes in the right superficial inguinal basin is  positive for micrometastatic disease. Staging contrast- enhanced CT imaging of the torso is negative for  metastatic spread. Complete blood count and compre - hensive metabolic panel, including serum LDH, are  normal. What would you recommend as the next step  in his management",D,"This patient has stage IIIa (T1N1aM0) MCC of the ex tremity based on the size of the primary tumor and microscopic involvement of the sentinel node. These tu mors are highly radiosensitive, and the use of adjuvant radiotherapy can decrease the risk of locoregional relapse. A retrospective analysis of MCC in the SEER database demonstrated improved OS with postoperative radiation compared with patients who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Hence this modality is commonly consid ered as part of the multimodal management of localized MCC. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is not well de fined in the setting of micrometastatic nodal disease. Re cent anti PD1 or anti PDL1 therapy with pembrolizumab or avelumab has shown promising results in advanced MCC. Regulatory approval is anticipated in this setting. However, its use in the adjuvant arena is still investiga tional.

Several sarcomas are associated with specific chromosomal  translocations. Which translocation is matched with the  correct sarcoma,B,Ewing sarcoma is most commonly associated with an 11;22 translocation. Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is associated with a 12;16 fusion of FUS with DDIT
Which of the following are characteristics of radiation-   induced sarcomas,E,"Radiation induced sarcomas, until recently, were thought to have somewhat of a worse prognosis. They usually occur be tween 10 and 40 years after previous radiation. Common his tological subtypes include osteogenic sarcoma, MFH of bone, and angiosarcoma. They are usually treated with chemother apy, in addition to surgery. LFS, an autosomal dominant con dition, is associated with an increased risk for sarcoma, glio mas, breast carcinomas, leukemia, and adrenocortical cancer."
"An 18-year-old male presents to his local emergency room  following a contact injury in his athletics class. Because the  patient is non-weight bearing, additional studies are or - dered. Plain x-rays reveal a lytic lesion (with pathological  fracture) in the distal femur with a small soft tissue compo - nent. When the attending physician discusses the findings  with the patient’s father, he notes that the young man has  had one eye removed. Following further gentle probing,  the father revealed that he had been diagnosed with ret - inoblastoma of the eye as a young child, which was treated  with chemotherapy and radiation.

"An ambitious medical resident was entering data into a  cancer research registry and noted multiple patients with  the same unusual last name. Because all patients had au - thorized Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act (HIPAA) waivers for research purposes, the resident  probed the records for additional information. His research  yielded that the seven patients were related. Diagnoses in - cluded one patient with leukemia, one with osteosarcoma,  two breast cancers, one soft tissue sarcoma of the thigh, one  colon cancer, and one adrenocortical cancer. Given the fa - milial nature and the specific diagnoses, what is most likely  responsible for this high incidence of malignancies",A,"Leukemia, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and soft tissue sarcoma are all represented in one family. These malig nancies are seen in families that have LFS, which is as sociated with mutations in TP53 , a gene present on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1). The cancers noted above are hallmark cancers in LFS and typically occur before the age of 45."
"When comparing preoperative to postoperative radiation  therapy (RT) for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extrem- ity, preoperative RT is associated with:  ",C,The National Cancer Institute of Canada performed a ran domized trial of preoperative versus postoperative radia tion therapy for extremity soft tissue sarcoma. It was found that preoperative radiation therapy is associated with more wound complications. Local control and survival is the same for either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy. Postoperative treatment results in more late tissue fibrosis and possible bone fracture. The radiation port size is smaller with preoperative treatment. Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma 217
A 42-year-old female patient presents with an 8-cm mass  within the left thigh. The mass is felt to be consistent  with a high-grade sarcoma on MRI scan. She is referred  to an orthopedic oncologist for evaluation. How should  a biopsy be obtained to confirm the diagnosis,B,"and E Biopsy of the primary tumor is essential for most patients with soft tissue masses. The preferred biopsy approach is generally the least invasive technique required to allow a definitive histological diagnosis and assessment of grade. In most centers, core needle biopsy provides satisfactory tissue for a diagnosis and usually provides adequate ma terial for molecular testing. If done under CT guidance, one can obtain multiple passes in areas where there is a solid tumor component as well as necrosis. Another option would be an incisional biopsy oriented longitudinally for extremity lesions, which facilitates a definitive wide lo cal excision and removal of the biopsy tract in situ. Care should be taken for meticulous hemostasis to prevent dis semination of tumor cells into adjacent tissue. Fine needle aspiration is helpful in confirming suspected recurrent dis ease, but does not usually yield enough tissue for a defini tive diagnosis and/or molecular testing."
Which sarcoma subtype commonly metastasizes to non - pulmonary sites,C,"Myxoid/round cell liposarcomas are characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 12 and 16, and they display a curious tendency to metastasize to soft tissue sites other than the lungs. Therefore, it is recom mended for this specific sarcoma subtype to obtain a CT scan not only of the chest, but also of the abdomen and pelvis, and MRI of the spine."
Which of the following soft tissue sarcomas carries a greater  risk of lymph node involvement at the time of initial pres - entation,D,"The prevalence of lymph node metastasis in adults with most sarcomas is very low; therefore, there is no role for routine regional lymph node dissection. However, patients specifically with angiosarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosar coma, epithelioid sarcoma, and clear cell sarcoma have an increased incidence of lymph node metastasis and should be carefully examined for adenopathy by physical examina tion, imaging, and possible sentinel lymph node sampling."
"A 67-year-old woman is diagnosed with a high-grade,  6-cm, synovial sarcoma of the right thigh. She has no evi - dence of metastases and undergoes limb-sparing surgery  followed by adjuvant radiation. You would recommend  the following surveillance studies:  ",D,"Soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity usually recur local ly or metastasize to the lung. It is unlikely for soft tissue sarcomas to metastasize elsewhere, with the exception of myxoid liposarcoma, which can spread to multiple non pulmonary sites, and alveolar soft part sarcoma, which has a propensity to metastasize to the brain. The role, cost ef fectiveness, and feasibility of a PET scan in the staging and surveillance of soft tissue sarcomas remain to be defined; further prospective studies are needed. For low grade soft tissue sarcomas, one usually follows the patient with chest radiograph and MRI; high grade soft tissue sarcomas are followed with chest CT and MRI."
Which  treatment would you recommend now,E,"This retroperitoneal tumor mass is consistent with a leiomyosarcoma, based on immunohistochemical stain ing. The standard of treatment for a retroperitoneal leio myosarcoma is surgical resection. There is no definitive evidence for the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/ or radiation. The use of imatinib is typically reserved for a GIST. Retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPSs) are relatively uncommon, constituting 10%–15% of all soft tissue sarcomas, with the most common histologies in adults being leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma. Surgical resection has traditionally been the only curative approach for localized, potentially resectable RPS. However, these tumors are usually diagnosed late with a large size and anatomic complexity. A complete resection with micro scopically negative margins (R0 resection) is required but not always achieved, and locoregional recurrence is common. Management by physicians experienced in the treatment of this entity is crucial. Adjunctive RT can reduce the risk of lo cal recurrence but has not been shown to improve overall survival. Due to the complexity of treatment and potential toxicity, preoperative RT also should only be performed at centers proficient in the treatment of these sarcomas. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) is currently performing a prospective randomized phase III trial (NCT01344018, STRASS Trial) of preoperative RT and surgery versus surgery alone, which hopefully should determine the role of preoperative RT in the management of RPS."
"A 68-year-old man is being examined by his primary care  doctor for a swollen left thigh and calf. Because the man  has had a DVT in the past, the physician utilizes a hand - held Doppler and carefully palpates both calves. A large,  deep-seated mass is palpated in the area of the left me - dial gastrocnemius. An MRI was performed, and the T2- weighted image showed a heterogeneous mass with a cen - tral region of necrosis. A needle biopsy in the outpatient  clinic was performed, and benign hemorrhagic soft tissue  was obtained. The next course of action for this patient  would be:  ",C,This patient history should be cause for suspicion of a hem orrhagic thigh sarcoma. Undergoing a needle biopsy in the clinic could miss areas of a tumor and only obtain areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. It is advised that the patient under go multiple CT guided Tru cut core biopsies. The CT guid ance allows better visualization of the mass and therefore increases the likelihood that not only necrotic and hemor rhagic areas will be biopsied but also the solid tumor area.
A 60-year-old female patient presents to her internist com - plaining of shortness of breath. The physical exam is oth - erwise normal. She has recently retired after working as  a gardener in a commercial greenhouse for 40 years. Her  surgical history is significant for cholecystectomy for gall - stones 8 years ago and a morcellator myomectomy 3 years  ago. She is a nonsmoker. Her family history is positive for  lung cancer in her father; her mother died of pancreatic  cancer; and an older sister had colon cancer. A CT scan of  her chest reveals small (<1 cm) bilateral pulmonary nod - ules. The most probable sarcoma on a differential diagno - sis list would be:  ,B,"This is an unfortunate woman who had a morcellator my omectomy procedure. Women with symptomatic uterine fibroids may have chosen to undergo this procedure be cause of the benefits of shorter postoperative recovery time and reduced infection risk compared with abdominal hys terectomy and myomectomy. However, recent reports and FDA guidelines now suggest that this can carry the risk of spreading cancerous tissues, which were not detected during the initial pathological examination, namely uter ine leiomyosarcoma. The patient is now presenting with bilateral pulmonary nodules, which are most consistent with metastatic leiomyosarcoma. The treatment of choice for this patient would be chemotherapy with either gem citabine/docetaxel or a doxorubicin containing regimen."
"A 42-year-old female marathon runner notes pain in the  lower right thigh and a questionable mass. She sees a  general surgeon who feels that this is a lipoma.

Pathology reveals a  high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with  lateral and posterior margins that are positive. Which  of the following would now be the appropriate treat - ment",C,"This is a middle aged woman with a mass found in her thigh where an excisional procedure has been performed with positive margins. The treatment of choice, if possible, would be re resection. Studies have shown there is resid ual disease in approximately 50% of patients. Following resection, the patient should receive adjuvant radiation. These patients can still be treated with a limb sparing procedure and do not require an above knee amputation. Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities is still controversial and is decided on an in dividual patient basis, based on the patient’s age, organ function and performance status, tumor size, and grade."
Which treatment would you recommend,C,"AIDS associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common malignancy occurring in patients with HIV . For those pa tients not already on HAART, it is indicated as the first treatment (regardless of CD4 count). Immune reconstitution can often result in regression of KS lesions without additional treatments. For extensive cutaneous, rapidly progressive disease, and/or visceral involvement, systemic chemotherapy is indicated, liposo mal doxorubicin being the treatment of choice. It is associ ated with a high response rate and very good tolerability; it is superior and safer compared with combination chemo therapy. For patients intolerant or refractory to liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel in a weekly or biweekly regimen is preferred as a second line treatment.Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma 218"
Imatinib is highly efficacious for many patients with gastro - intestinal stromal tumor (GIST). For which other sarcoma  with a specific chromosomal translocation has it also been  shown to be effective,A,"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare sarco ma involving the soft tissue characterized by a 17;22 chro mosomal translocation involving the COL1 A1 and PDGFB genes, causing upregulation of the PGFF beta receptor. Imatinib has activity against the PDGF beta pathway, and it has been shown to be effective in patients with advanced DFSP . Alveolar soft part sarcoma is highly vascular but is a chemoresistant histology. Responses with both sunitinib and cediranib (both potent vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] inhibitors) have been seen."
"A 64-year-old man is evaluated for worsening left hip  pain. He has a history of multiple hereditary exostosis, and  a plain radiograph shows a large, aggressive, destructive  secondary chondrosarcoma arising from a previous lesion  in the left proximal femur. The patient has a wide surgical  resection with a limb-sparing prosthesis reconstruction.  Pathology shows stage II chondrosarcoma; the margins  of resection are negative. Following surgery, this patient’s  management should include:  ",E,"This is an older male with a conventional chondrosarco ma. These are usually treated with surgical resection and are resistant to standard chemotherapy. Those chondro sarcomas that are treated with chemotherapy include ded ifferentiated chondrosarcoma, using a multidisciplinary approach similar to that used for osteosarcoma, as well as mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, which has a biphasic histology with cellular areas composed of small anaplas tic cells reminiscent of Ewing sarcoma interspersed with islands of bland appearing chondroid matrix. They are treated with therapy similar to Ewing sarcoma."
It is increasingly recognized that different pathological  subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas have variable patterns  of chemosensitivity. Match the sarcoma subtype with the  appropriate known chemotherapy sensitivity.  ,D,"Synovial sarcomas are known to be sensitive to ifosfamide. Leiomyosarcomas are sensitive to doxorubicin and gem citabine/docetaxel. Myxoid/round cell liposarcomas are treated with Adriamycin (doxorubicin), gemcitabine/doc etaxel. Most recently, trabectedin has been FDA approved for both leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma with a significant improvement in progression free survival. Scalp angiosarco mas are sensitive to paclitaxel. Finally, alveolar cell sarcomas are chemotherapy resistant. More recently, they have been treated with Cediranib or sunitinib."
"An 18-year-old student is receiving high-dose methotrex - ate (MTX) during treatment for an osteosarcoma of the dis - tal femur. He has a history of gastritis and was previously  on a proton pump inhibitor. He is also a vegan and has had  a poor appetite. As part of the treatment with MTX, what  would you recommend",C,"One has to be very careful when treating patients with high dose MTX, since patients are at risk for both renal and other toxicities. Recommendations include maintain ing a urine pH greater than or equal to 7.0 (alkalinizing the urine) and vigorous hydration with adequate urine output, so the drug will not precipitate in the renal tu bules. Co administration of proton pump inhibitors is as sociated with delayed elimination of MTX, and therefore should be avoided, if possible, during treatment. Twenty four hours after starting MTX, the patient should begin to receive calcium leucovorin every 6 hours until the MTX level is below 0.05–0.1 μM. Glucarpidase (carboxypepti dase G2) was FDA approved in 2012 for the treatment of toxic MTX plasma concentrations (>1 μM) in patients with delayed MTX clearance due to impaired renal func tion. Although the indications for its use are not fully established, one should consider the use of this drug in a patient with early renal dysfunction if the serum MTX level is greater than 10 μM beyond 42–48 hours. Glucarpi dase metabolizes folic acid (and leucovorin) and other chemically similar antifolates (i.e., MTX) to their inactive metabolites. A single dose can rapidly decrease MTX lev els by 98% in the first 30 minutes, which, in the major ity of patients, is sustained. Adverse effects are minimal. Another name for calcium leucovorin is folinic acid. One should never use this name, since it is similar to folic acid and can be confused with it. Folic acid will not rescue nor mal cells; it does not enter into the folic acid cycle beyond the MTX block."
"In addition  to continuing hydration and urine alkalinization, you would:  ",D,"This woman has high risk features for ifosfamide induced encephalopathy. The factors associated with increased risk for ifosfamide induced encephalopathy include a large pelvic lesion, elevated creatinine, a low albumin, prior cisplatin treatment, and/or concomitant aprepitant use. The encephalopathy is thought to be secondary to the ac cumulation of chloracetaldehyde, one of the breakdown products of ifosfamide. Treatment of choice for this patient would be to stop the ifosfamide, continue IV hydration and alkalinization of the urine, and consider starting the patient on methylene blue. All patients treated with ifos famide should have a G6PD deficiency assay performed prior to starting the drug, since the use of methylene blue can cause massive hemolysis in a G6PD deficient patient. If the patient is G6PD deficient, one could consider treat ment with either valium or thiamine. Phenobarbital is con traindicated since several reports have shown worsening of the encephalopathy."
"A 59-year-old female with a previous history of hepatitis,  who was otherwise healthy, had a 6 cm high-grade undif - ferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma resected 4 years ago from  the left thigh, followed by adjuvant radiation. Surveil - lance chest CT now shows 15 small bilateral pulmonary  metastases. MRI of the thigh is negative. CBC, creatinine,  and liver function tests are all normal. The patient wishes  to pursue treatment. In your discussion with her, which  statement would be true about comparing the below-listed  treatments to single-agent doxorubicin",D,"Single agent doxorubicin is the benchmark against which single and multiagent regimens should be tested. In the EORTC trial 62012, which randomized patients to doxoru bicin single agent versus doxorubicin plus ifosfamide for advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, the doublet was associated with a doubling in response rate and increased toxicity, but it was not associated with an overall survival benefit. The GeDDiS trial presented at ASCO 2015 randomized patients with advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma to doxorubicin or gemcitabine/docetaxel. The doublet showed no benefit in progression free or overall survival, and was associated with increased toxicity. Pazopanib, un like doxorubicin, carries a risk of hepatotoxicity (which is occasionally life threatening). Given this risk, close moni toring of liver function tests is recommended, specifically for the first 9 weeks of treatment. There is no overall survival benefit in metastatic soft tissue sarcoma from combination chemotherapy. Single agent doxorubicin is still recommended for palliation and as a reference for newly designed randomized trials. Since the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide showed dou ble the response rate, it should be considered for patients in the neoadjuvant setting, for tumor shrinkage requiring symptom control, and for imminently life threatening dis ease. These decisions need to be made on an individual basis with the patient."

The patient is now short of breath with a low oxygen saturation. She is afebrile, with a normal white blood count and no evidence of pulmonary embo li. Chest x ray and CT findings are most consistent with gemcitabine induced pulmonary toxicity. The treatment of choice for this patient is to stop the gemcitabine and start the patient on corticosteroids. Early recognition is impor tant because there have been fatalities from this condition reported in the literature.

Which  is the most important variable in helping to determine  whether this patient should receive adjuvant imatinib  therapy",C,"The primary determination of whether a patient should receive adjuvant therapy for a primary resected GIST is based on the tumor site, size, and mitotic rate. Tumor rup ture predisposes a patient to a higher risk of recurrence. The most important factor for GIST recurrence after sur gery is a high tumor mitotic rate (>5 mitoses per 50 high power fields)."
"An  endoscopic biopsy is immunohistochemically positive for  CD117 and DOG1, and the mitotic index is three mitoses  per 50 high-power fields.

What would you relate to the patient about con - sidering treatment with adjuvant imatinib",C,"When considering adjuvant imatinib for a patient follow ing surgical resection of a primary GIST, gastric GISTs have a somewhat better prognosis. Tumor size and mi totic rate are important in determining the use of adjuvant imatinib; however, they are not important in predicting the response. Imatinib is recommended at 400 mg for 3 years, based on long term data from a Scandinavian study. Pa tients with the PDGFR D842V mutation do not respond well to imatinib. A mutational analysis can be helpful in assessing those patients who will respond to imatinib."
"An 18-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain  and fullness of 5 months’ duration. The pregnancy test  is negative. She has had a history of long-term gastritis.  She undergoes an endoscopy, which reveals several tumor  nodules, the largest of which is 3 cm in diameter. Pathol - ogy of the tumors is consistent with an epithelioid GIST,  CKIT and DOG1 positive.

"A 64-year-old man with an 8-cm gastric GIST and three  liver metastases is started on imatinib 400 mg daily. Mu - tational analysis reveals an Exon 11 KIT mutation. He is  very anxious and asks for a CT scan to be repeated at 6  weeks. The CT scan shows no change in the size of the  gastric mass, but an increase in size of the liver metasta - ses and two new small liver lesions, all with decreased  density. What is the next best step in management for this  patient",A,"This male patient with a metastatic gastric GIST to the liver receiving imatinib has had CT scans performed fairly ear ly. One does not always see a decrease in tumor size at this point in time. Following imaging of liver metastasis, one can see an increase in size but with decreased density, sug gesting necrosis and a response to imatinib. In addition, smaller liver metastases, which were not seen in an earlier scan, once necrosed, can also appear with a low density. A PET scan at this time showed no FDG activity. Therefore, this patient appears to be having a response to imatinib, and one would continue this patient on 400 mg and not increase to 800 mg or switch to sunitinib."
"A 65-year-old man is referred to the Medical Oncology  Department after undergoing resection of a 5-cm gastric  GIST. Pathology reveals a tumor that is CD117 and CD34  positive with one mitosis per 50 high-power fields, and Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma 216 the margin of resection is 1 mm. Mutational analysis was  sent and shows a KIT Exon 11 mutation. You would recom - mend:  ",C,"For patients who have an initial resection of a primary GIST, the decision to recommend adjuvant imatinib is dependent on the risk of recurrence, which is based on tumor size, mitotic index, anatomic location, and the occurrence or absence of tumor rupture (spontaneous or during surgery). It is also recommended to obtain mu tational analysis, since patients with a PGFRA D842V , SDH deficient, or NF 1 related tumor are usually imatinib insensitive. There are several risk stratification models. A modification of the National Institutes of Health Consensus Criteria in corporates both site and tumor rupture, as well as size and mitotic index. An alternative to these risk stratifications systems, which classify patients into discrete categories (very low risk to very high risk), is attempting to quantify the risk of disease recurrence as a continuous variable with the use of a GIST prognostic nomogram (MSKCC website). Most guidelines recommend adjuvant imatinib for “high risk” category patients, and those who have an estimated risk of recurrence that is greater than 30%–50%. However, each patient must be assessed individually, balancing age, performance status, and comorbid medical problems with the estimated likelihood of recurrence. The standard of care treatment is 3 years of adjuvant imatinib at 400 mg daily, based on the SSG XVIII rand omized trial of 1 year versus 3 years. There is no adjuvant data on 800 mg imatinib or the use of other tyrosine ki nase inhibitors. SSG XVIII defined “high risk” as a tumor size greater than 10 cm, mitotic index greater than 10 per 50 high power fields, or tumor size greater than 5 cm and greater than 5 mitoses per 50 high power fields. This patient, by consensus criteria, would be classified as low risk and by the MSKCC GIST nomogram would have a 2 year and 5 year recurrence free survival, after sur gery, of 95% and 91%, respectively. Therefore, no adjuvant imatinib would be recommended."
The following is characteristic of patients with Ewing  sarcoma:  ,E,"Ewing sarcoma is more common in Caucasians, and rare in patients of African or Asian descent. It is most commonly associated with an 11;22 chromosomal translocation. Both classical Ewing sarcoma and PNET are felt to be similar entities, and both are now classified as part of the Ewing family of tumors and treated similarly. Ewing sarcoma can commonly present with a soft tissue mass. The pathologi cal response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be predic tive of survival."
The following is true regarding classic chondrosarcoma:  ,A,"Chondrosarcomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors that characteristically produce a cartilage matrix with calcification and myxoid changes. Clinical behavior is de pendent on grade, and treatment is predominantly surgi cal resection. They are the second most common primary tumor of bone and predominantly arise in older individu als (>50 years of age), with an equal distribution amongst males and females. The pelvis is most commonly affected; the femur, ribs, and humerus are other common sites. They can arise in preexisting benign lesions, such as multiple enchondromas (Ollier disease or Maffucci disease) or with multiple hereditary osteochondromas."
What factor has been shown to correlate with survival  benefit regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy for osteosar - coma,E,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be of benefit for patients with primary osteosarcoma. Those patients who, on histopathological review, have greater than 90% tumor necrosis appear to have an improved survival. Adding ifosfamide for patients with a poor pathological response has not been shown to be benefi cial. Although approved in Europe, the addition of mi furmatide has not definitively been shown to add to im proved survival, especially in those patients with a poor pathological response. Pegylated interferon in the EURA MOS Randomized Study was not shown to be of benefit for pathological good responders. A significant number of patients were unable to complete the 2 years of treat ment because of toxicity."

Further workup for this patient should include:  ",A,"After diagnosis of a primary osteosarcoma, further workup should include a CT scan of the chest and a bone scan. The patient is at risk for the development of lung metastases as well as skip bone lesions. It is extremely rare for osteosarcoma to involve lymph nodes or metastasize to the abdomen or brain.Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma 220"
"An 18-year-old college student presents to the health  center with shoulder pain, swelling, and a low-grade fe - ver. Physical exam reveals a large and firm scapular mass.  Blood work is significant for both the elevated erythrocyte  sedimentation rate and a high lactate dehydrogenase con - centration. Radiographic evaluation of the mass shows a  very large permeative lucent lesion of the scapula with evi - dence of soft tissue involvement. Pathological examination  of the patient’s tumor will most likely reveal:  ",C,"This young man’s history of a fast growing tumor of the scapula, an elevated sedimentation rate and LDH, and x rays showing a permeative lucent lesion are suggestive of a small round blue cell tumor consistent with Ewing sar coma. Immunohistochemical staining for CD99 (mic2 anti gen) and glycogen is usually positive. In order to confirm the diagnosis, one should send out tissue for chromosomal analysis. Ewing sarcoma is most often associated with a t11;22 chromosomal translocation. The treatment of choice should be aggressive chemotherapy with vincristine, adri amycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) alternating with IE for several cycles, followed by surgical resection and then ad ditional alternating chemotherapy with VAC/IE.

"A 72-year-old man with no significant past medical history  presents with worsening pain in his lower back. Computed  tomography (CT) and bone scans show innumerable os - teoblastic lesions throughout the appendicular skeleton.  MRI of the spine reveals no evidence of cord compression.  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is elevated at 107 ng/mL.  Multiple attempts are made to biopsy the bone lesions, but  insufficient samples are obtained for histological diagnosis.  Which of the following is the next best step in management",B,"The patient has metastatic prostate cancer with multiple bone metastases and should be treated with combined ADT and docetaxel per the results of the CHAARTED trial, which demonstrated significant improvement in overall survival compared with ADT alone. Tissue diagno sis is typically preferable before initiating chemotherapy; however, an elevated PSA with osteoblastic lesions in an older man is consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic pros tate cancer. Enzalutamide and abiraterone are approved in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer only. Carbopl atin and paclitaxel would be an appropriate regimen for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary."
Which of the following should be included in the  further evaluation of this patient,C,"This patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with a stage III embryonal carcinoma, a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, due to nonregional nodal metastatic disease. Recognition of the diagnosis of a germ cell tumor is im portant, as it is often curable with systemic chemotherapy despite the presence of metastatic disease. OCT3/4 and SOX2 are most commonly expressed in embryonal carci noma. Upfront PET and bone scans are not indicated in the workup for patients with germ cell tumors (PET CT scans can be useful later on in the evaluation of residual masses following primary chemotherapy). Pleural biopsy has no role in the evaluation of this patient. Retroperito neal lymph node dissection is indicated in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors with residual retrop eritoneal masses following systemic chemotherapy."
Bilateral diagnostic  mammography and breast MRI are negative. The patient is  currently deemed too high of a surgical risk for any surgi - cal interventions given her recent myocardial infarction. A  colonoscopy 1 year ago was unremarkable. Which of the  following is the most appropriate management,B,"The patient has an adenocarcinoma of unknown primary with peritoneal carcinomatosis and elevated CA 125. Giv en this presentation, the patient should be treated as if she has an ovarian primary. Treatment would ideally involve optimal surgical debulking with overall curative intent; however, any potential surgical intervention will have to be postponed in this patient due to a recent myocardial infarction. Thus, systemic therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel is most appropriate at this time. FOLFOX chem otherapy would be a good choice if she had metastatic colorectal cancer, but her presentation is more consistent with ovarian cancer, and treatment for metastatic colorec tal cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis would be with palliative intent. Intraperitoneal cisplatin is only indicated for patients with optimally debulked stage II or III ovarian cancer, and is generally given in combination with intrave nous cisplatin and paclitaxel. Olaparib would be indicated only after failure of multiple lines of therapy for ovarian cancer. Capecitabine would be an appropriate choice for metastatic breast cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis."
5 cm node and do not reveal any other suspicious  lesions. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan  shows focal uptake in the left axilla (SUVmax 15) but in no  other locations. Which of the following is the next best step  in management,C,"Adenocarcinoma within an isolated axillary lymph node frequently represents occult breast cancer in women. This patient with clinical T0N1M0 disease should undergo ei ther mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection, or axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiation. En doscopies may be useful in evaluating an occult primary in a cervical lymph node, but they should not be utilized in this patient. A bone scan is unlikely to reveal occult osse ous metastases in the setting of a negative PET CT. Medi astinoscopy is used to evaluate mediastinal nodal disease in patients with lung cancer and does not have a role in this scenario. Skin examination may be useful in finding a primary melanoma lesion, but it is more likely that this patient has axillary breast cancer given histology consist ent with adenocarcinoma."
"A 64-year-old man with a 40-pack-year smoking history,  multivessel coronary artery disease, and congestive heart  failure (left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%) presents  with dyspnea and nonproductive cough from a recurrent  right-sided pleural effusion. Pleural fluid cytology from a  thoracentesis specimen reveals epithelioid cells with posi - tive immunohistochemical stains for CK5/6, WT1, and  calretinin. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows no  other abnormalities other than the effusion. The patient is  deemed not a surgical candidate due to his cardiac comor - bidities. He has normal renal and hepatic function. Which of  the following is the best treatment option for this patient",A,"The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with ma lignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) as evidenced by pleural fluid cytology positive for CK5/6, WT1, and cal retinin. Mesothelin would also likely be positive. Diagno sis may also warrant a video assisted thoracoscopic sur gery (VATS) with pleural biopsy; however, this patient has been deemed not to be a surgical candidate. The standard of care treatment for inoperable MPM consists of plati num plus pemetrexed, with or without bevacizumab. In this patient with multiple comorbidities, carboplatin may be used instead of cisplatin, based on multiple phase II studies. Carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel, gem citabine, or etoposide would be appropriate treatments in metastatic non small cell lung cancer (in the absence of an actionable EGFR mutation and ALK or ROS1 rearrange ments). Pembrolizumab is indicated in untreated patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with PD L1 expres sion above 50% and negative or unknown EGFR , ALK , and ROS1 status."
No viable tumor specimen remains for further analy - sis. Serum PSA is within normal limits. Colonoscopy and  upper endoscopy are performed with no significant find - ings noted. What is the next best step in management,C,"The patient has an adenocarcinoma of unknown primary with multiple liver metastases. Given the immunohisto chemical staining pattern, the patient most likely has met astatic colorectal cancer. Thus, the patient should receive systemic chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine based reg imen. A repeat liver biopsy is unlikely to yield additional in formation. Liver MRI may help distinguish metastases from multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma, but this diagnosis is unlikely as the tumor is CK20 negative. It is unlikely that an exploratory laparotomy would reveal new diagnostic infor mation, and it would not change the staging as metastatic disease has already been demonstrated. Fecal occult blood testing is not indicated in the setting of negative endosco pies, and metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma would be managed similarly to metastatic colorectal cancer.Unknown Primary Site 226"

This  malignancy should be approached most similarly to which  of the following primary tumor sites",E,"The patient’s isolated p16 positive squamous cell carcino ma in a cervical lymph node most likely reflects a human papillomavirus (HPV) associated head and neck primary tumor. Thus, management options for this patient include primary neck dissection followed by adjuvant radiation with or without chemotherapy or upfront chemoradiation followed by observation or neck dissection. Cervical and anal squamous cell carcinoma may also be HPV associated and stain positive for p16, but there would likely be other evidence of regional lymphadenopathy.

"A 72-year-old man with a 30-pack-year smoking history  presents with a 20-pound unintentional weight loss over  the last 3 months. He is physically active and continues  to walk 1 mile every day. PET-CT reveals multiple FDG- avid bilobar liver lesions (SUVmax 18), but no other areas  of abnormal FDG uptake. Core biopsy of one of the liver  lesions reveals poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and  immunohistochemical stains are positive for TTF-1, CK7,  and napsin A, and negative for chromogranin and synap - tophysin. Testing for EGFR  mutations, ALK , and ROS-1   rearrangements are negative. PD-L1 staining is 0%. Brain  MRI shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the  next best step in management",A,"The patient has multiple liver metastases from an occult lung adenocarcinoma, manifested by positive TTF 1, CK7, and napsin A staining in a patient with a heavy smoking history. As the PD L1 expression is below 50%, first line pembrolizumab is not indicated. Standard of care for pre viously untreated metastatic non small lung cancer would thus consist of a platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) in com bination with bevacizumab and paclitaxel or pemetrexed. Chromogranin and synaptophysin stains would be posi tive in a patient with small cell lung cancer, in which case cisplatin and etoposide would be appropriate treatment for extensive stage disease. Gemcitabine and nab pacli taxel or FOLFOX and bevacizumab would be appropriate regimens for patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma or metastatic colorectal adeno carcinoma, respectively."

Which of the following is the next  best step in management,D,"The patient has squamous cell carcinoma of unknown pri mary, manifested by positive staining for CK5/6 and p63, and negative for CK7 and CK20. This cancer likely arose from the anogenital tract. He only has one isolated area of unilateral inguinal lymph node involvement, but extranod al extension places him at a higher risk of cancer recurrence; thus, adjuvant radiation therapy to the nodal basin should be offered. Carboplatin and paclitaxel could be an appro priate option following radiation therapy. Doxorubicin is an appropriate treatment for systemic Kaposi sarcoma, which this patient does not have. Retroperitoneal dissection may be indicated in germ cell tumors, but not in this case. Observation would be inappropriate given extranodal ex tension seen at the time of lymph node dissection."

It is a high grade, aggressive tumor with a high Ki67 proliferation index of 70%. Regimens designed for extensive stage small cell lung cancer (platinum and etoposide) are generally used for treatment of this disease. Octreotide can be used in patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinoma or carcinoid syndrome, but would be inappropriate in this patient with aggressive small cell histology. Everolimus and temozolomide and capecitabine are options in refrac tory unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal neuroen docrine carcinoma, and gemcitabine and nab paclitaxel is a treatment option in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma."

Cerebrospinal fluid  cytology is negative. PET-CT does not reveal any signifi - cant findings. Which of the following is the most appropri - ate initial treatment for this patient,A,"The patient has a primary central nervous system lym phoma (PCNSL) as evidenced by characteristic findings on MRI and immunohistochemical staining pattern. Appropri ate induction therapy consists of high dose methotrexate (MTX) plus rituximab (temozolomide can also be included). Another induction option is MTX 3.5 g/m2 with radiation and either vincristine, procarbazine, and cytarabine (with or without rituximab), or ifosfamide. Chemoradiation with temozolomide is appropriate for the treatment of glioblasto ma multiforme following surgical resection. Surgery has no established role in the management of PCNSL in the absence of impending herniation. Whole brain radiation therapy is a viable option for patients who would not tolerate chemo therapy, and a high dose chemotherapy regimen with stem cell rescue can be used as consolidation therapy for patients in complete remission following high dose MTX."
Which of the following is true regarding the use of molecu - lar profiling in the management of patients with a carci - noma of unknown primary,B,"Molecular profiling has become more commonplace in the clinic for use in carcinomas of unknown primary. In a single arm prospective study, a 92 gene assay was as sociated with a median overall survival of 12.5 months in carcinoma of unknown primary patients treated with assay directed therapy. However, there are no prospective randomized trials demonstrating such a survival benefit compared with immunohistochemical analysis, and no cost effectiveness has been shown. BRAF V600E mutations can predict the response to single agent vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma, but this finding does not hold true for metastatic BRAF mutant colorectal cancer.

"She had been in remis - sion for 5 years and presented with progressive headaches  for 1 month, and for the last 2 days, she developed with  nausea, vomiting, and blurry vision. On the exam, she has  papilledema and her gait is impaired. A brain MRI with  gadolinium showed a noncommunicating hydrocephalus  and leptomeningeal enhancement but no brain metasta - ses. She then underwent a lumbar puncture with opening  pressure of 30 cm of water, and CSF cytology was positive  for carcinoma. Which of the following is correct about in - trathecal chemotherapy",A,"The correct response is intra CSF chemotherapy through lumbar puncture or through an Ommaya reservoir is con traindicated because of the increased intracranial pres sure and hydrocephalus. Increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus are contraindications for intrathecal or intra Ommaya chemotherapy, because they imply abnor mal CSF flow, which compromises CSF drug distribution, treatment efficacy, and significantly increases neurotoxic ity at the site of CSF injection. Intra CSF chemotherapy is more established in certain subtypes of leukemias and lymphomas, and no randomized trial has cleared demon strated a survival benefit in leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors. Intrathecal trastuzumab is currently in early phase trials for HER2 positive leptomeningeal metastases, but no efficacy data are available. Leptome ningeal metastases tend to be a terminal event in meta static cancer patients; the median survival of solid tumors leptomeningeal metastases was only 2.3 months in a large retrospective series."
"A 61-year-old woman presented with progressive apa - thy, personality changes, and aphasia and underwent  a brain MRI, which showed a large left-frontal mass  originating from the dura mater but invading the brain  and causing vasogenic brain edema. She underwent a  craniotomy and partial tumor resection because the por - tion of the tumor invading the brain could not be safely  resected. Pathology was compatible with a WHO grade  3 (anaplastic) meningioma. The tumor had rhabdoid fea -tures and ≥20 mitoses per high-powered field. What is  the recommended next step for this patient",C,"The correct answer is involved field radiation to the residual tumor and tumor margin. Meningiomas are graded in the WHO classification as benign (grade I, about 80% of cases), atypical (grade II, 17% of cases), and anaplastic (grade III, 3% of cases). Malignant meningiomas are locally aggressive neoplasms with a very high rate of recurrence or progression, even after gross total resection. Distant systemic metastases are uncommon. Adjuvant focal RT is a standard component of initial management for all malignant meningiomas, regardless of the extent of resection, to improve local control and over all survival. In a series of 63 patients with anaplastic (WHO grade III) meningiomas treated with surgery and radiation, recurrence free survival rates at 2, 5, and 10 years after initial therapy were 80%, 57%, and 40%, respectively, and overall survival rates were 82%, 61%, and 40%.

5  cm on the immediate postsurgical scan. What is the best  next step for this patient,B,"The correct answer is to proceed with adjuvant temozolo mide and consider TTFields with early MRI follow up in 1–2 months. It is well known that chemoradiotherapy with te mozolomide for glioblastoma patients is associated with pro gressive and enhancing lesions on MRI, noted immediately after the end of treatment, which are not related to tumor progression, but which are a treatment effect. This so called pseudoprogression can occur in up to 20% of patients who have been treated with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy and can explain about half of all cases of increasing lesions after the end of this treatment. These lesions decrease in size or stabilize without additional treatments and often remain clinically asymptomatic. Pseudoprogression occurs more of ten in glioblastomas with methylated MGMT promoter and continuation of temozolomide and clinical confirmation of pseudoprogression may be associated with better outcomes. Moving to a second line therapy too quickly based on first MRI post chemoradiotherapy is not recommended in this situation, especially when MRI changes are asymptomatic. The recent trial EF 14 showed that addition of TTFields to adjuvant temozolomide after chemoradiotherapy improves outcomes. Median overall survival was 20.5 months in the TTFields plus temozolomide group ( n = 196) and 15.6 months in the temozolomide alone group ( n = 84) (HR = 0.64, P = 0.004). TTFields have been FDA approved for the first line glioblastoma therapy based on these results. There are no targeted drugs with proven activity against EGFRviii glioblastomas, and trials of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and peptide vaccine rindopepimut have been disappointing."

LassmanMalignancies of the Central Nervous System 229 symptoms. What are the most likely diagnosis and the next  diagnostic procedure",E,"The correct response is ocular involvement by lymphoma and slit lamp exam by an ophthalmologist. About 30% of the recurrences of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma involve the eyes. Visual floaters, uveitis, and visual loss are the most common presentations. Slit lamp is a low power microscope combined with a high intensity light source that can be focused as a thin beam to better exam the eye. Ocular involvement usually affects the posterior seg ment of the eye, including the vitreous, choroid, or retina, with subsequent development of uveitis, exudative retinal detachment, and retinal or vitreous hemorrhages. Diag nosis can be made clinically with the slit lamp in patients with known primary CNS lymphoma or by biopsy of the involved vitreous, choroid, or retina in less typical cases."

Patients older than 3 years of age at diagnosis with totally or near totally resected, non disseminated disease (average risk) still need to undergo craniospinal radiation because of the high risk of neuroaxis tumor dissemination. Younger patients are at highest risk of severe cognitive, developmental, and endocrinological abnormalities with craniospinal radiation. Over the last few decades, craniospinal radiation doses have been re duced from 3600 cGy to 2340 cGy and chemotherapy has been added.

Extent of dis - ease workup showed no ocular involvement by a slit-lamp  exam, CSF cytology and flow cytometry were negative,  and body PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy were negative.   Patient was started on dexamethasone with neurological  and performance status improvement. He had no history  of iatrogenic immunosuppression, his serum HIV was  negative,  and the diagnosis was compatible with a prima - ry central nervous system lymphoma in an immunocom - petent individual. What is the best first step in treatment",D,"The correct is answer is high dose methotrexate in combination with other drugs such as rituximab, high dose cytarabine, and thiotepa. Until the 1990s, primary central nervous system lymphoma was often treated with whole brain radiation (WBRT) alone. Although this is a radiosensitive tumor, relapses were frequent, and the median survival on the RTOG 8315 trial was only 11.6 months. The addition of a high dose methotrexate based regimen to WBRT on the single arm RTOG 9310 trial increased the median overall survival to 36.9 months. The best combination of drugs in addition to high dose metho trexate is not defined, but randomized trials through the IESLG showed that addition of high dose cytarabine, ritux imab, and thiotepa improved outcomes. CHOP has no role in PCNSL due to poor blood brain barrier penetration and a negative randomized trial showing its lack of efficacy. In tra CSF therapy has very limited penetration into the brain parenchyma disease but could be useful in patients with positive CSF. Autologous stem cell transplant is under in vestigation as a consolidation regimen after induction with high dose methotrexate based regimens."

His brain MRI showed a 5-cm dif - fusely enhancing lesion in the deep right cerebral hemi - sphere and mild hydrocephalus. Patient underwent a par - tial resection of the tumor. Pathology was compatible with  a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. What is the best  next step for this patient",E,"The correct answer is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus. Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder leading to constitutive activation of mTOR and growth of benign tumors in several organs. In the brain, growth of subependymal giant cell astrocyto mas can cause life threatening symptoms such as hydro cephalus, requiring surgery. EXIST 1 was a double blind, placebo controlled, phase 3 trial, where patients (aged 0–65 years) were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio to oral everoli mus 4·5 mg/m2 per day (titrated to achieve blood trough concentrations of 5–15 ng/mL) or placebo.

"A 45-year-old woman had a seizure. Noncontrast CT of  the head shows a hypodense abnormality in the right  frontal lobe with small internal foci of calcification. Brain  MRI shows a 3-cm lesion that is hyperintense on T2 se - quences with subtle enhancement following injection of  gadolinium contrast. Gross-total resection demonstrates  anaplastic oligodendroglioma (World Health Organiza - tion grade III). Molecular analyses demonstrate 1p19q  co-deletion, IDH1 mutation, and MGMT promoter meth - ylation. Seizures are well controlled with levetiracetam  without other signs or symptoms. Performance status is  normal. What phase III supported treatment do you rec - ommend",B,"The correct answer is RT before/after chemotherapy with PCV . Observation would not be appropriate for a high grade (WHO grade III, anaplastic) glioma. 1p19q co deletion is a diagnostic marker of oligodendroglioma histology and is rare in astrocytomas or other glioma subtypes. It is also a favorable prognostic marker regardless of treatment. Finally, it is predictive of benefit from DNA alkylator chem otherapy as demonstrated by long term results of RTOG and EORTC phase III studies. Patients with 1p19q co delet ed anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors lived about twice as long following RT+PCV than RT alone. In RTOG 9402 sur vival was 14.7 versus 7.3 years ( P = .03, hazard ratio 0.59), and in EORTC 26951 survival was not reached versus 9.3 years ( P = .0594, hazard ratio 0.56). Although the EORTC results didn’t quite reach traditional measures of statistical significance ( P < .05), this analysis (survival in 1p19q de leted cases) was not preplanned or powered for survival, as the importance of 1p19q deletion was not elucidated until after the trial was designed. Of note, the RTOG trial used four cycles of “neoadjuvant” (pre RT) “intensive” PCV (with higher doses of each drug and shorter cycles) and the EORTC trial used up to 6 cycles of post RT adjuvant PCV at standard dosing. Accordingly, RT alone is inadequate. Bevacizumab prolongs progression free survival in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, and may have a role in other gliomas, but bevacizumab alone would not be appropriate treatment. Some investigators would ad vocate for chemotherapy alone and would replace PCV by temozolomide. The Phase III Intergroup Study of RT versus Temozolomide Alone versus RT with Concomitant and Ad juvant Temozolomide for Patients with 1p/19q Codeleted Anaplastic Glioma (the “CODEL” trial) led by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (formerly the North Central Cancer Treatment Group) originally randomized patients to RT alone, RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolo mide, or temozolomide alone in an exploratory arm. After mature results from RTOG 9402 (and then EORTC 26951) became available, that trial was redesigned, and the RT arm was replaced by RT and PCV (at standard dosing)."
She is  on phenytoin for seizures. Her performance status is nor - mal. Which of the following do you recommend,C,"The correct answer is RT and concurrent temozolomide fol lowed by adjuvant temozolomide and GBM and NovoTTF. EORTC trial 22981 26981 NCIC trial CE.3 demonstrated that RT with concurrent temozolomide followed by 6 cy cles of temozolomide improved survival versus RT alone; thus, RT alone is inadequate (median survival 14.6 vs. 12.1 months, hazard ratio 0.63, P < .001). The 5 year follow up also demonstrated a sustained benefit from temozolomide. Of note, PCP prophylaxis is recommended during concur rent treatment. GBM is a highly vascular tumor, but beva cizumab has not been shown to improve survival in newly diagnosed or recurrent disease. For example, two rand omized studies for newly diagnosed GBM (RTOG 0825 and AVAglio) found prolonged progression free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) by adding bevacizumab to RT and TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM versus placebo. Similarly, EORTC trial 26101 found improved PFS but not OS for bevacizumab added to lomustine versus lomustine alone for recurrent GBM. Regardless, bevacizumab alone without RT or temozolomide is not supported by clinical trial data. Studies in elderly patients have suggested the temozolomide alone in the context of MGMT methyla tion is a reasonable option, but it is not a reasonable op tion in younger patients such as in this case. Checkpoint and PD1 inhibitors are under investigation in various clini cal trials for gliomas. Finally, a recent phase III trial also demonstrated improved PFS and OS from the addition of NovoTTF, a device that delivers low intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields when worn on the scalp (median PFS 7.1 months vs. 4.0 months, hazard ratio 0.62, P = .001; median OS 20.5 months vs. 15.6 months, hazard ration 0.64, P = .004). However, that trial has been criticized for lack ing a placebo control, and it has not gained widespread use yet. Therefore, RT and concurrent temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide without NovoTTF remains the most commonly used approach."
What do you  recommend,A,"The correct answer is lomustine. The combination of beva cizumab and lomustine was studied definitively in Eu ropean Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 26101; patients were randomized to lomustine or lomustine and bevacizumab. There was im proved progression free survival from the addition of bev acizumab but not overall survival. Therefore, controversy remains whether the risks and costs of bevacizumab are warranted versus lomustine alone. Notwithstanding such controversy, bevacizumab increases the risk of surgical wound dehiscence and should be deferred until 4 weeks or more postoperatively. Carboplatin alone has limited to Malignancies of the Central Nervous System 233 no efficacy in recurrent GBM. Lomustine alone is the most reasonable choice of the options presented, but has limited efficacy (median PFS ∼2 months, median OS ∼9 months); accordingly, a clinical trial may be preferable."
What do you rec - ommend,C,"Of the options presented, treatment as a WHO grade IV GBM with RT and temozolomide is the most appropriate. There is no data to support bevacizumab alone, although small studies suggest prolonged PFS in recurrent ana plastic astrocytoma from bevacizumab. In the absence of MGMT methylation, temozolomide alone will likely have limited efficacy and is not a widely accepted treatment, although one study from the Neurooncology Working Group of the German Cancer Society (NOA 04) suggested noninferiority of primary chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy at recurrence. As a high grade tumor, obser vation is not appropriate. There is no data to suggest ipili mumab monotherapy is effective in gliomas. An ongoing international trial (phase III trial on concurrent and adju vant temozolomide chemotherapy in non 1p/19q deleted anaplastic glioma: the CATNON intergroup trial) led by the EORTC (trial 26053 22054) will definitively address the efficacy of RT and temozolomide versus RT alone for anaplastic (WHO grade III) gliomas without 1p19q co deletion."

Incom - plete resection demonstrates a low-grade (WHO-grade II)  oligodendroglioma with 1p19q co-deletion, IDH  mutation,  and MGMT  promoter methylation. Seizures are well con - trolled with levetiracetam, and performance status is nor - mal. What do you recommend",E,"The correct answer is 54 Gy radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy with PCV . RTOG 9802 randomized patients with low grade gliomas who either were over 40 or had in complete resection to RT or RT followed by PCV . The addi tion of PCV prolonged both PFS and OS on long term anal ysis (median survival 13.3 vs. 7.8 years, hazard ratio, P = .03). The benefit was most striking in oligodendrogliomas. Therefore, RT alone is inadequate. Bevacizumab has no es tablished role in the treatment of low grade (WHO grade II) gliomas. Similarly, carboplatin alone is not supported by available data. As opposed to high grade (WHO grade III– IV) gliomas that are typically treated with approximately 60 Gy of RT, low grade (WHO grade II) gliomas are typi cally treated with a lower RT dose. EORTC trial 22844 dem onstrated no PFS or OS benefit in patients randomized to 59.4 Gy versus 45 Gy of RT (median OS 6.6 years in both arms). An intergroup trial similarly showed no OS benefit but increased toxicity from a 64.8 Gy versus 50.4 Gy. There fore, 60 Gy is generally considered excessive for WHO grade II gliomas. Younger patients (under 40 years) with completely resected small tumors may have long survival and experience late toxicities from aggressive early thera py; observation, or chemotherapy alone for those patients may be reasonable, but clear randomized data is lacking as reviewed elsewhere."

Brain imaging by contrast enhanced MRI discloses one en - hancing lesion near the surface of the left frontal lobe. Sys - temic restaging is stable without any other sites of disease  outside the lungs or the brain. What do you recommend  for treatment of the brain metastasis",D,"The correct answer is Resection followed by 30 Gy of WBRT. WBRT is an accepted treatment for brain metastases (BMs). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conducted a series of trials in the 1970s–1990s, and none demonstrated a fractionation or treatment schedule clearly superior to 30–35 Gy in 10–15 fractions. The use of surgery was studied in three randomized trials in combination with WBRT ver sus WBRT alone. The most widely cited trial demonstrated that survival was prolonged and functional independence maintained for longer in patients with one BM who un derwent resection and WBRT compared with WBRT alone (median survival 9.2 vs. 3.5 months, P = .01). In addition, functional independence was maintained for a longer duration, and recurrence of the local BM was lower in the patients who underwent surgery. Although other trials showed conflicting results, surgery followed by WBRT is widely accepted as appropriate for patients with one resect able BM. Whether patients with two or more metastases should undergo resection is more controversial; radiosur gery is also considered an acceptable treatment and likely superior to WBRT alone for patients with one BM. Whether WBRT itself can be omitted in patients who undergo resec tion of (or radiosurgery treatment to) one BM is an area of controversy. In the absence of an EGFR mutation, erlotinib is not a preferred choice."

Brain  imaging by contrast enhanced MRI discloses three deep en - hancing lesions, each in different lobes. The largest diameter  is 3 cm for 1 lesion and 2 cm for the other 2 lesions. Systemic  restaging shows no new sites of extracranial metastases and  improved disease in the right lung. What do you recom - mend for treatment of the brain metastasis",D,"The correct answer is radiosurgery to each lesion followed by active surveillance with contrast enhanced brain MRI scans every 2–3 months. WBRT is an accepted treatment for brain metastases (BMs). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conducted a series of trials in the 1970s–1990s, and none demonstrated a fractionation or treatment schedule clearly superior to 30–35 Gy in 10–15 fractions. As the lesions are deep in the brain and multiple, SRS rather than resection is reasonable. Several randomized trials compared WBRT with or without radiosurgery. The addition of SRS to WBRT may not improve survival, but it reduces the risk of recurrence at the original sites and throughout the brain. Select subsets also live longer following combination therapy. Therefore, SRS and WBRT is preferable over WBRT alone. Concerns over neurocognitive injury from WBRT led to further stud ies that omitted WBRT following surgery or SRS and deter mined whether WBRT itself can be omitted in patients who undergo resection of (or radiosurgery treatment to) 1–3 BMs is an area of controversy. Although WBRT following SRS to 1–3 BMs may not improve survival, it reduces the local rate of recurrence and the risk of new BMs developing. Some studies suggest the risk of neurocognitive deterioration from recurrent BMs is higher than from WBRT. Accordingly, SRS to each lesion followed by WBRT would also represent a reasonable choice, although that was not among the op tions listed. In the absence of an EGFR mutation, erlotinib is not a preferred choice. PD 1 inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of brain metastases, but they are not presently approved for that indication. Leaving two of the lesions un treated would not be appropriate."

Reviewing the peripheral smear can be help ful in identifying disorders leading to thrombocytope nia. The constellation of macrothrombocytopenia and Döhle bodies raises the possibility of the May Hegglin anomaly, a congenital disorder due to mutations in the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain gene (MYH9). May Hegglin is typically a benign disorder that does not re quire treatment. CALR mutations have been associated with JAK2 wild type myeloproliferative neoplasms. ADAMTS13 levels are reduced in TTP .

Many second line options for chronic ITP exist and the choice of therapy should be based on patient comorbidities and preference. Splenectomy, rituximab, and TPO receptor agonists are all considered reason able second line therapies for chronic ITP . This patient’s morbid obesity, CAD with angina, as well as oxygen dependent COPD make him a suboptimal surgical can didate (choice B). Based on his liver function tests and hepatitis studies he likely has chronic hepatitis B, and therefore rituximab would not be an optimal choice, due to the risk or hepatitis B reactivation. Romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, is FDA approved for second line therapy of ITP with an expected response rate of 60%–80% and would be a reasonable, albeit un likely curative, option (choice C). Many other drugs including danazol and azathioprine have been used in chronic ITP , but response rates are generally less than 20%, and use is typically reserved to those refractory to the aforementioned second line therapies."

Two types of tests utilized for the diagnosis of HIT include enzyme immunoassays for the antiplatelet factor 4 (PF4)/ heparin antibodies and functional assays such as the sero tonin release assay (SRA) and heparin induced platelet ag gregation assay. Sensitivity of the enzyme immunoassay is high (close to 99%); therefore clinically insignificant anti bodies may be detected. Functional assays such as SRA or heparin induced platelet aggregation assay are performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIT in the setting of a positive enzyme immunoassay. Thus answer B is the appropriate first step in the laboratory evaluation of HIT in this case scenario. Answers D and E are incorrect, as the platelet function assay and platelet aggregation tests are utilized to measure platelet adhesion and aggregation and has no role in the diagnosis of HIT."

What is the most appropriate next step in management",B,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is an autosomal recessive disorder with normal coagulation laboratory testing and platelet count. It is caused by defects, either qualitative or quantitative, in the receptor for fibrinogen on platelets, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, a.k.a., α2bβ3 in the integrin nomen clature. The hallmark diagnostic finding is the failure for platelets to aggregate in response to platelet agonists, such as collagen, arachidonic acid, or ADP . The response of platelets to ristocetin is preserved.1 Bernard Soulier is another autosomal recessive plate let disorder that presents with lifelong bleeding that is caused by defects in the platelet receptor complex, glyco protein Ib/IX/V2. Since this receptor binds to ristocetin, which causes platelet agglutination , as opposed to aggre gation , on platelet aggregation testing only the response to ristocetin is impaired, with the response to all other platelet agonists intact. In addition, it is characterized by TABLE 33.19 Answer Options: Question 146 Factor V Leiden APC Resistance A Negative Negative B Negative Positive C Positive Negative D Positive PositiveCoagulation 269 a macrothrombocytopenia , further differentiating it from Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Platelets from patients who have ingested aspirin or who have an aspirin like defect, will not respond to ara chidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is eventually converted into thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which leads to platelet aggregation. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxyge nase 1 and 2, which is the first step in TXA2 synthesis. The addition of TXA2 bypasses this block and leads to normal platelet aggregation, confirming the presence of either aspirin or an aspirin like defect. Platelet respons es to collagen, ADP , and TXA2 would still expected to be normal. Clopidogrel, along with similar agents such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and ticlopdine, inhibit the ADP receptor on platelets, P2Y 12. Thus, only a blunted re sponse to ADP in a platelet aggregation assay would be expected. The May Hegglin anomaly is an MYH9 related disor der, and is characterized by a macrothrombocytopenia and Döhle like bodies in neutrophils, along with the variable presence of sensorineural hearing loss, glomerular dis ease, and/or cataracts. Response to platelet aggregation is typically preserved.3"

It is frequently misdiagnosed as ITP , with affected patients commonly receiving a number of treatments for ITP that are frequently ineffective. While the precise mechanism(s) for cyclic thrombocytopenia remain(s) un known, a hormonal effect is noted, as affected women typically experience nadir platelet counts with their men strual cycles.

Quebec platelet disorder is a very rare genetic dis ease that can manifest with a mild thrombocytopenia, although platelet counts can be normal, and occurs with out thrombocytosis. It is associated with postsurgical bleeding, although affected patients can have many other bleeding symptoms. It is caused by a duplication of the urokinase plasminogen activator gene, PLAU. It is treated with the use of antifibrinolytics, such as ε aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid. Scott syndrome is another very rare platelet disorder that is characterized by an inability of platelets to translo cate phosphatidylserine to the platelet surface. This leads to a severe hemorrhagic phenotype that is associated with completely normal coagulation testing and normal platelet counts. The only known treatment is with platelet transfusions.

The prevalence of a platelet count of less than 100,000 × 109/L is observed in only 1% of pregnant women. Causes of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy may or may not be pregnancy specific. The most common cause of thrombocytopenia during preg nancy is gestational thrombocytopenia (GT), which ac counts for 70%–80% of cases. The mechanism of GT is unknown, but accelerated clearance and hemodilution may play a role. GT commonly occurs during the sec ond or third trimester and is associated with a platelet count greater than 70,000/ μL. No special management is required, and thrombocytopenia resolves within 6 weeks postpartum. GT is not associated with neona tal thrombocytopenia. This patient’s clinical picture is most consistent with GT, and therefore no treatment is indicated. The mode of delivery should be based on obstetric indications. Prednisone and IVIG are first line therapies for immune mediated thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. ITP usually presents earlier in gestation and with lower platelet counts. Treatment for ITP is indicat ed for clinically relevant bleeding or platelet count less than 30,000/ μL. Other rare causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy include severe preeclampsia, HELLP syn drome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The treat ment for these conditions after 34 weeks gestation is delivery and supportive care."

He is asymp tomatic. Given a prior normal CBC 1 year ago and cur rent isolated thrombocytopenia, this patient likely has immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Therapy consists of treating and preventing bleeding episodes. The deci sion to treat ITP should be based on an individual pa tient’s symptoms, bleeding risk (based on prior bleeding episodes and other risk factors for bleeding), potential side effects from treatment, and upcoming surgeries/ procedures. In adults, treatment may be indicated in the absence of bleeding if the platelet count is very low (<30,000 × 109/L). For this patient, the degree of throm bocytopenia he has should not put him at increased risk for bleeding for minor surgeries like upcoming wisdom tooth extraction. Therefore no treatment is indicated at this time. Instead, a conservative approach with follow up of her platelet count should be sufficient. Helicobacter pylori infection is rarely associated with ITP , most fre quently in patients from endemic areas such as Japan and parts of Europe. In this setting, without specific symptoms associated with H. pylori infection, testing would be of low yield. More extensive testing such as a bone marrow biopsy is generally not indicated in young, otherwise asymptomatic patients with isolated mild thrombocytopenia."

Regarding chest tube place - ment and the patient’s coagulopathy, what is the most ap - propriate course of action",B,"Drug induced thrombocytopenic pupura (DITP) should be considered in any patient with acute onset thrombo cytopenia. Many mechanisms of DITP exist. In the case of sulfonamide antibiotics, an antibody is produced that binds to normal platelets only in the presence of the sensi tizing drug. The diagnosis is suspected by establishing that the candidate drug preceded the thrombocytopenia, with drawing the drug results in complete and sustained recov ery of platelet count, and when other causes of thrombo cytopenia are ruled out. Typically 5–7 days of exposure is needed to produce sensitization in a patient given the drug for the first time. A detailed medication history (prescrip tion and over the counter medications) should be elicited when evaluating such patients. Negative antibody test ing does not rule out the diagnosis. Many patients do not Coagulation 270 require targeted therapy other than stopping the offending drug . For patients with severe thrombocytopenia or “wet purpura,” platelet transfusions should be considered. Cor ticosteroids are often given, but there is no role in DITP , un like idiopathic ITP .

The diagnosis of TTP is secured by the pathognomonic low ADAMTS 13 activity of less than 5% due to either a congenital or acquired defi ciency of this von Willebrand factor cleaving protease. Lack of ADAMTS13 leads to unusually large von Wille brand multimers and the risk of platelet thrombi in mi crovasculature with high shear stress. An ADAMTS13 activity less than 5% is not seen with other thrombotic microangiopathies such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is caused by complement dysregu lation. Further, aHUS can be distinguished from TTP based on the degree of renal insufficiency, with the for mer leading to more pronounced dysfunction. Type 2B von Willebrand disease is characterized by a “gain of function mutation,” leading to increased binding of the vWF to platelets with resultant thrombocytopenia from increased clearance.

Similarly, it is not necessary to administer furosemide or calcium gluconate if the potassium is not truly elevated."
"A 55-year-old man with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is  known to have chronic thrombocytopenia with a baseline  platelet count in the 40,000 × 106/L range. He was recently  diagnosed with a large cerebellar glioma requiring surgi - cal resection, and he presents for recommendations about  perioperative management of his thrombocytopenia.  PMHx includes peptic ulcer disease, grade 2 esophageal  varices, splenomegaly, and internal hemorrhoids. He nei - ther drinks nor smokes. He refuses transfusion since he is  a Jehovah’s Witness. Ultrasound shows a spleen size of 19  cm and portal hypertension. He is treated with eltrombop - ag at 25 mg daily for 2 weeks, with his platelet count rising  from 45,000 to 110,000 × 106/L. His surgery is scheduled  for 2 days from now. The patient is planned to remain on  eltrombopag for 10 days postoperatively and then taper  off over the next week.     Which of the following is the most frequent risk of this  medical therapy in this patient",B,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is caused by an inhibitor to ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand factor cleaving protease, should respond to corticoster oids + plasma exchange within 4–7 days. The presence of such an inhibitor in this case strongly favors the di agnosis of TTP rather than an alternative explanation. In such cases of refractory TTP , rituximab is expected to be of clinical benefit in most cases, often within 2 weeks of administration. Twice daily plasma exchange has also been proposed, although there is less data on this option. Splenectomy may be of use, but with the significant as sociated morbidity, rituximab would be the first choice. There are case reports to demonstrate the efficacy of bort ezomib; however, there are no trials of this agent in refrac tory TTP ."

Which is the most appropriate anticoagulant at this time",B,"This patient has delayed heparin induced thrombocyto penia with thrombosis (HIT/T). Antibodies in patients with HIT form against complexes of heparin and PF4 (platelet factor 4) and lead to drops in platelet counts of 50% or more. Paradoxically, HIT patients may go on to develop arterial or venous thrombosis. HIT is reported to occur in up to 1% of individuals who have been treated with unfractionated heparin. While classic HIT occurs 5–10 days after start of heparin therapy, HIT may also oc cur after heparin cessation. Delayed onset HIT should be considered when a patient presents with thrombosis with or without thrombocytopenia up to 3 weeks after the end of heparin therapy.Coagulation 272 Patients with HIT/T should be treated with a direct thrombin inhibitor such as argatroban. While certain patients may be treated with fondaparinux, this patient has worsening renal insufficiency, and thus a renally cleared anticoagulant such as fondaparinux would not be appropriate therapy. Patients with HIT should not receive further heparin therapy. The patient’s throm bosis was caused by HIT, and thus further hypercoag ulable testing would not be useful. Lastly, a D dimer would add nothing to the management of this patient, who has already been diagnosed with thrombosis and is recently postop."

Which of the following is the most appropriate action to  take at this point,D,"Eltrombopag is a small molecule agonist of the TPO re ceptor and is indicated for treatment of immune throm bocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and hepatitis C associ ated thrombocytopenia requiring interferon therapy. Eltrombopag has also been used to raise platelet counts in patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia prior to invasive procedures. In this latter group, however, an increased rate of portal vein thrombosis was noted, necessitating early termination of the study. Hepatic laboratory abnormalities (increased serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bili rubin) are frequent (up to 10% in the EXTEND study), usually mild, and reversible with drug discontinuation; moreover, they are infrequently associated with clinical ly significant symptoms. At the current time, no avail able data show an increased risk of either development or progression of hematologic malignancies or cataracts with either short or long term treatment. Development of myelofibrosis is reversible with drug discontinuation and may be more related to the increased megakaryo cyte load in ITP patients, rather than other patient popu lations."

Twelve patients were treated with plasma exchange. All patients recov ered. Miller and colleagues subsequently reported 18 cases of thrombotic microangiopathy in 15 patients, all of who were treated with supportive care only for infections and renal dysfunction.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in  management",D,"The patient has developed a new thrombosis while thera peutic on warfarin anticoagulation. This could certainly be a warfarin failure due to malignancy (in which case we might change her warfarin back to long term enoxapa rin or other low molecular weight heparin), but notably, the patient has thrombocytopenia in conjunction with the thrombosis. The thrombocytopenia was noted 9 days af ter starting therapy with low molecular weight heparin. There are no other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, and this gives the patient a 4T score of 8—putting her at very high probability of having heparin induced throm bocytopenia. The best treatment at this time is argatroban. Heparin or LMWH is contraindicated. The patient has al ready clotted through therapeutic warfarin. Rivaroxaban is indicated neither for HITT nor for cancer associated malignancy, and would also not be the correct answer. A reasonable choice might be fondaparinux, but this was not given as an option."
9 aPTT 36 seconds      How should the patient be treated at this time,E,"Pseudothrombocytopenia occurs in certain individu als who make a substance, which leads to platelet clumping in the presence of EDTA anticoagulation. The clumping can be seen on examination of the peripheral blood smear. The clumped platelets are not recognized as individual platelets by the Coulter counter, and the platelet count is thus falsely depressed. In many cases, rechecking the platelet count on blood drawn into a citrate anticoagulated tube may lead to a more accu rate platelet count by blocking the platelet clumping. The thrombocytopenia is artifactual, and does not need therapy, so treatment with corticosteroids would not be indicated. The platelet clumping occurs only in vitro, so antiplatelet agents are also not indicated. Stopping medications will not necessarily have an effect on this benign condition. Patients should be reassured about this condition and counseled about informing future health care providers about their spurious laboratory values."
"In addition to stopping warfarin and giving vitamin K,  which of the following should be given to stop her bleeding",B,"Thrombocytopenia during pregnancy is a common finding. Gestational thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of a low platelet count in a pregnant woman. It is most common during the third trimester and does not cause a platelet count of below 50,000 × 109/L. When the platelet count falls below, then ITP should be suspected. Barring that, treatment with cor ticosteroids of gammaglobulin is not indicated. There is no thrombotic microangiopathy (TTP , eclampsia, or HELLP) necessitating emergent delivery of the fetus. Once thrombocytopenia is identified, careful platelet monitoring is warranted. Antiplatelet antibody titers will not aid in the diagnosis."

In addition, concomitant use of NSAIDs and SSRIs increase the bleeding risk due to the fact that some SSRIs inhibit p450, which helps metabolize certain NSAIDs. A recent metaanalysis confirmed the in creased risk of GI bleed in patients taking SSRIs. Flutica sone, fexofenadine, and levothyroxine do not increase the risk for bleeding.

In addition to endoscopy and consideration of PRBC  transfusion, which of the following interventions would  be most successful in controlling bleeding",B,"Type 2b von Willebrand disease accounts for less than 5% of all cases of vWD. The disease is due to a gain of function mutation in the A1 domain in the vWF protein, which subsequently results in increased binding to gly coprotein Ib α on platelets. This subsequently leads to increased clearance and loss of high molecular weight vWF multimers. In type 2b and type 2a vWD, there is a disproportionate decrease in the Ristocetin cofactor activity as compared with the level of von Willebrand antigen (vWF:RCO:vWF Ag; choice B). In type 2b vWD there is also a decrease in only the high molecular weight von Willebrand factor multimers due to in creased binding of larger multimers to platelet glyco proteins, rather than a decrease in all vWF multimers (choice A). Thrombocytopenia is seen in 40% of cases of type 2b vWD due to increased clearance and seques tration of small platelet aggregates that are formed (choice C). RIPA is increased as the abnormal vWF binds to platelets at lower concentration of ristocetin as compared with normal vWF, leading to aggregation of platelets to low dose ristocetin, which is unique to type 2b vWD (choice D). The pattern described in choice E would be consistent with Glanzmann thrombasthenia and not vWD."

Fac tors VIII and IX are normal, thereby making factor XI deficiency (Hemophilia C) the most likely diagnosis. Deficiencies in factor XII and contact factors such as prekallikrein or high molecular weight kininogen could lead to an elevated aPTT, but would not lead to bleed ing. Of the choices listed, only FFP would have utility in treating FXI deficiency (choice A). In Europe, but not the Coagulation 274 United States, a factor XI concentrate is available. Cryo precipitate would be effective in fibrinogen deficiency or dysfunction, as well as in hemophilia A or vWD when specific products are not available (choice B).

6 ). A normal tracing is shown on top  of her results as a comparison.       Her TEG tracing (bottom) is most consistent with:  ,D,"The aPTT is an in vitro assay used to monitor heparin therapy and to evaluate for bleeding disorders. Many conditions that do not cause bleeding can prolong the aPTT, including a lupus anticoagulant, factor XII deficien cy (choice B), and deficiency of contact factors. The best predictor of operative bleeding is a patient’s prior bleed ing history in the face of hemostatic challenges, which was quite benign in this patient. Given that hemophilia A, B, and C have been ruled out, a lupus anticoagulant is the most likely diagnosis. The lack of correction of the aPTT on 1:1 dilution with fresh frozen plasma is also sup portive and also serves to rule out factor XII deficiency. As a lupus anticoagulant is typically not associated with bleeding, it would be safe to proceed with surgery (choice D). When faced with an unexpected elevated aPTT, the most important thing is to rule out a deficiency or ac quired inhibitor to factor VIII, which has been done in this case by the normal factor VIII assay, and thus a fac tor VIII inhibitor assay would not be indicated (choice C). Hemophilia B or C had also been ruled out, and the semi urgent surgery should proceed as planned (choice A). The prolongation of the aPTT in this case is most likely sec ondary to a lupus anticoagulant, and while labs should be sent to evaluate this, there is no reason to delay surgery while waiting results (choice E)."

Of the choices listed, IVIg (choice E) would be indicated for treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired vWD secondary to a paraproteinemia. DDAVP could also be considered, but it is often ineffective and was not listed as a choice. Factor VIII infusion would not be effective, as hemophilia A is unlikely with a normal aPTT (choice A). Despite the abnormal PFA, platelet transfusion is unlikely to be helpful as the defect in acquired vWD is due to a lack of vWF and ability to bind platelets to the endotheli um (choice B). FFP is not indicated as there is no evidence of a factor deficiency or fibrinogen deficit (choices C and D). Recombinant factor VIIa is not indicated for this situ ation."

His current level is 10%, and you plan to dose him to a target of 80%. Based on the fact that it takes two units of factor IX (as opposed to 1 unit for factor VIII) to raise the level in 1 mL of plasma from 0% to 100%, the fol lowing formula can be used to approximate the proper dosing: Dose of factor IX = weight (kg) × (desired % increase). As the recovery is not as great with recom binant factor IX, this dose is usually multiplied by 1.2– 1.4, depending on the product. Thus in this patient the dose would be 100 × (80–10) × approx. 1.2 = 8400 units (choice D). Choices B and C would only be appropri ate if there was evidence of an inhibitor, which is rare with hemophilia B and made even less likely in this case where the aPTT corrects on 1:1 dilution. The dos ing in choices A and E are incorrect. Note that dosing for factor VIII is weight (kg) × (desired % increase) × 0.5.

While there are case reports of spontaneous remis sions in patients with acquired hemophilia, this is rather uncommon. As noted previously, it is recommended in the elderly to make an attempt to eradicate the inhibitor."

This is based upon the observation that many patients with vWD do not respond fully to DDAVP . If the patient is noted to be responsive to DDAVP , then a dose of 0.3 μg/kg should be administered immedi ately prior to her procedure. For minor procedures such as this, the intranasal formulation can be given, which should be the 1.5 mg/mL concentration. A generic form of intranasal DDAVP should be avoided, as this is a dilute concentration (0.1 mg/mL), and is used for the treatment of diabetes insipidus and enuresis. While the use of either vWF:FVIII concentrates or rvWF would be reasonable if a patient was unresponsive to DDAVP , given the minor nature of the procedure, this would not the first choice of prophylaxis against bleeding prior to her procedure. Although the use of ε aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid is very effective in patients with vWD, this is typically limited to areas with increased rates of fibrinolysis, such as the oral, nasopharyngeal mucosa, or genital tract."

His diagnosis was made in the United States 3 months  ago. He has a known family history of a bleeding disorder.  He was given a dose of rFIX for a right knee bleed, with - out any adverse events. There had been one prior episode  of a left buttock hematoma, which occurred when he fell  down on a step, which was treated with a single-dose of  rFIX. Most recently, he developed another lump in his left  buttock and presented for evaluation. Immediately follow - ing completion of the infusion, the ER nurse noted “red- splotches” and that he started wheezing shortly thereafter.  Hematology is consulted.       Based upon this history, which of the following is the most  likely explanation for the reaction",B,"Based upon the history provided, the most likely cause for the patient’s intermittent thrombocytopenia is the presence of type 2B von Willebrand disease. This is char acterized in part by an exacerbation of thrombocytope nia with pregnancy and DDAVP administration. Type 2B vWD is caused by a gain of function mutation in the 2A domain of vWF that leads to spontaneous platelet binding, leading to thrombocytopenia and loss of high molecular weight multimers of vWF. Type 2A vWD shows the loss of high molecular weight vWF multim ers but not the thrombocytopenia. While sequencing of VWF typically shows a mutation in exon 28, the RIPA, which should show an increased response at lower doses of ristocetin, is typically performed first. While the role of DDAVP in the treatment of type 2B vWD is controversial, it has been noted to decrease the platelet count further. Flow cytometry for gpIB/IX/V expression is per formed to test for Bernard Soulier syndrome. Given the history of normal platelet counts, this is not the cause for the patient’s thrombocytopenia, as these patients have a lifelong and constant thrombocytopenia. Staining neutrophils for NMMHC IIA is a screen ing test for the MYH9 related disorders, such as the May Hegglin anomaly. If there is abnormal localiza tion, characterized by a co localization with inclusion bodies, this is diagnostic of an MYH9 disorder. While there may be a range of platelet counts, like Bernard Soulier, normal platelet counts are not observed, and this is not typically associated with a hemorrhagic phenotype. While antibody mediated destruction of platelets has long been considered to be one of the main causes of ITP , due to the low sensitivity and specificity of platelet antibody testing, this is not recommended in the evalu ation of a patient with thrombocytopenia. Furthermore, the reported lack of response to IVIG and steroids casts doubt on an immune mediated cause of this patient’s thrombocytopenia. In any pregnant patient presenting with thrombo cytopenia, attention should be paid toward potentially fatal consumptive disorders, such as preeclampsia, HELLP , or TTP . While TTP can present in pregnancy, it would not be expected for someone to have recurrent events and survive without treatment. As there is no history of therapeutic plasma exchange, testing for AD AMTS13 deficiency, which would be seen in TTP , is not the correct option."

As a result of their online research, during  a scheduled clinic visit, they inquire about the role of im - mune tolerance therapy (ITT) to eradicate Justin’s inhibi - tor. The risks and benefits of embarking upon this course,  which include the lower rates of success with ITT, recur - rence of his inhibitor to FIX, costs, and possible need for  central access, are discussed.       Which of the following is another important possible com - plication of ITT",D,"Patients who have a ventricular device placed are at an increased risk for bleeding, not only from the use of anti coagulants and/or antiplatelet agents, but from acquired von Willebrand disease. In a significant number of LVAD patients, loss of high molecular weight multimers of vWF is noted. This is felt to be due to the increased shear and pressures through the device. Platelet aggregometry would be expected to be ab normal, not only due to the presence of aspirin, but from the presence of a ventricular assist device. This would not be expected to offer any worthwhile information. A thrombin time would likewise be expected to be abnormal due to the recent use of heparin and would not provide any useful information. Although the patient was on heparin, there is no his tory of thrombocytopenia or thrombosis. Testing for hep arin/PF4 antibodies in the postbypass setting could yield a false positive result."

While the use of antiplatelet therapy or new onset thrombocytopenia remains possible, this is not supported by the history and is a less likely cause. Prior to increasing the dose of his infusions or switch ing to a different product, the presence of an inhibitor Coagulation 276 needs to be evaluated. It is not likely that a weight in crease over the course of 6–12 months would account for his lack of response to therapy. The use of fibrinolytic inhibitors is very useful in sites of increased fibrinolytic activity. However, in a patient with a joint bleed and suspected inhibitor, this interven tion is not likely to benefit the patient."

As a result, it has been recommended that the initial doses of replacement FIX be administered in a monitored environment. The remaining choices are not likely to cause allergic type reactions."
1)       Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in  management,D,"As noted previously, immune tolerance therapy (ITT) for inhibitors in hemophilia B are fraught with more complications than ITT in hemophilia A. This includes the development of nephrotic range proteinuria during ITT, so that regular measurements of renal function and urine protein are recommended.

"A 63-year-old woman with ischemic cardiomyopathy  was admitted for worsening heart failure symptoms,  ultimately requiring intubation and placement of an  intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). With aggressive diu - resis and optimization of her inotropic agents, she re - quired less support, allowing for extubation, with her  IABP to be discontinued after shift change. However,  she suddenly developed a severe headache with pho - tophobia and meningeal signs. A stat head CT showed  the presence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, felt to be  due to a ruptured aneurysm. Neurosurgery is ready  to take her to the OR for coil embolization of the an - eurysm and another one noted nearby. However, they  cannot do so until the effect of her heparinization for  the IABP is reversed. An urgent hematology consult is   requested.       Which of the following is the most appropriate recommen - dation",A,"The patient has factor XII deficiency, which despite the markedly elevated aPTT, is not associated with any hem orrhagic manifestations. In addition, deficiencies of high molecular weight kininogen and prekallikrein, which also have prolonged aPTT levels, are devoid of bleeding mani festations. As such, there is no indication for any replace ment therapy."
"3), what is the most likely etiology of the bleeding   problem",B,"This patient represents a typical presentation for vita min C deficiency, although anyone with a diet devoid of citrus or vitamin C intake is at risk for developing scur vy. While there are numerous manifestations of scurvy, such as weakness, fatigue, anorexia, and myalgias, the hemorrhagic symptoms are often pronounced. This can be characterized by widespread ecchymoses, with a pre dilection for the legs, perifollicular hemorrhages (that can be confused for petechia), gingival swelling and bleeding, as well as increased vascular fragility, which can lead to a misdiagnosis of palpable purpura or vas culitis. While there is a history for alcohol abuse, with the macrocytosis and thrombocytopenia supporting the ef fects of long term use, regardless of the measured level, ethanol would not explain his findings. Similarly, the likely marginal diet and macrocytosis can increase the risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. However, this would not lead to hemorrhagic manifestations. The prolonged PT is due to a combination of liver disease from ethanol abuse and poor nutrition. Although the patient has a macrocytosis and throm bocytopenia, a primary hematologic disorder such as my elodysplasia would not lead to his physical examination findings. 58. F Use of a four factor PCC is indicated, as this will allow rapid reversal of the effect of warfarin in a patient with a history of heart failure. Co administration with vitamin K is recommended to allow for the resynthesis of the vita min K dependent clotting factors. Given the urgency of the need for reversal of the anti coagulant effect, administration of vitamin K alone would not provide adequate hemostasis in time, regardless of the mode of administration. While FFP will replace the necessary coagulation factors, the volume that is needed for restoration of hemostasis would be prohibitive in a patient with a history of cardiomyopathy, particularly as repeated infusions of FFP are typically required."

Platelet aggrega - tion studies reveal normal platelet aggregation in the  presence of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic  acid (AA), epinephrine, and collagen, but decreased   aggregation with ristocetin. What is the most likely di - agnosis",A,"This patient has type 1 vWD, which is a mild quan titative deficiency of vWF characterized by mucocu taneous bleeding. Type 1 vWD is characterized by a von Willebrand activity:antigen ratio of greater than 0.5–0.7. Further, since type 1 vWD is a quantitative de ficiency, all von Willebrand multimers are present but simply in decreased amounts. In contrast, patients with type 2 vWD have a qualitative deficiency of vWF. All type 2 vWD subtypes (type 2A, 2B, 2M) except for 2N have a vWF activity:antigen ratio of less than 0.5–0.7 due to the dysfunctional von Willebrand protein. Mul timers are variably present depending on the subtype. Type 2A is characterized by a preferential loss of inter mediate and high molecular weight vWF multimers. In type 2B vWD there is a gain of function mutation in vWF that leads to enhanced binding of vWF to its platelet receptor glycoprotein 1b. This increased bind ing leads to rapid clearance of the vWF platelet com plex and resultant thrombocytopenia and loss of high molecular weight multimers. Type 3 vWD is due to a complete quantitative deficiency of vWF, and therefore patients have significantly reduced von Willebrand activity and von Willebrand antigen levels, as well as absent multimers."

What is  the most likely diagnosis",C,"This patient has a history of both mucocutaneous bleed ing and hemarthrosis that could be consistent with he mophilia. In addition, she has a family history of “he mophilia.” However, hemophilia is an X linked disorder passed down on the maternal side. Further, her paternal uncle does not respond well to FVIII concentrates, which is likely due to his misdiagnosis as a hemophilic. The pa tient and probably her uncle have type 2N vWD, which is due to a rare mutation in the factor VIII binding site of vWF. This leads to accelerated clearance of unbound FVIII and therefore severely low FVIII activity. Type 2N patients can have mildly low or normal vWF activity and antigen levels if they have inherited a type 1 allele, along with the type 2N allele. Von Willebrand multimers are typically normal. Patients are often misdiagnosed as having hemophilia. The definitive diagnosis is made by measuring the vWF:FVIII binding capacity (which is low) and can then be confirmed by genetic testing.Coagulation 277"
5 .       Which of the following is the most appropriate product to  administer preoperatively,D,"The patient described has bleeding consistent with pri mary hemostasis defect (i.e., platelet type bleeding). Her laboratory markers reveal normal aPTT and PT, further making secondary coagulation defects less likely (e.g., he mophilia). While thrombocytopenia can be seen in type 2B von Willebrand disease (vWD), type 1 vWD does not present with thrombocytopenia. Glanzmann thrombas thenia is a congenital qualitative platelet disorder due to a mutation in the GP IIb/IIa receptor that leads to de fective platelet aggregation. Bernard Soulier syndrome is both a qualitative and quantitative platelet disorder characterized by defective GP 1b/IX platelet receptor and “giant” platelets, which are also decreased in num ber. Platelet aggregation studies in Glanzmann thrombas thenia reveal absent aggregation in the presence of ADP , AA, epinephrine, and collagen, but normal agglutination with ristocetin. In contrast, platelet aggregation studies in Bernard Soulier patients show normal platelet aggrega tion in the presence of all stimulants but decreased ag glutination in the presence of ristocetin. Since both Glan zmann thrombasthenia and Bernard Soulier are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, family history may not be apparent. Therefore this clinical presentation and labo ratory findings are most consistent with Bernard Soulier syndrome."

Her D dimer is normal. Hemophilia A and B are characterized by a prolonged PTT and usually affect males, as they are X linked disorders (although fe male carriers can have bleeding symptoms). Fibrinogen disorders, either quantitative or qualitative, can present with similar symptoms, as in this patient, but are char acterized by a prolonged aPTT, PT, and thrombin time. This patient has FXIII deficiency, a rare bleeding disor der with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2 million. Diag nosis can be challenging as initial screening labs are nor mal (aPTT, PT, and thrombin time). Relying on increased clot solubility in 5 M urea, dilute monochloroacetic acid, or acetic acid can lead to underdiagnosis as this test only detects activity levels less than 5%. The diagnosis of FXIII deficiency is made by checking FXIII activity; more specific tests such as molecular analysis should be used for confirmation. Umbilical stump bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage are hallmarks of FXIII defi ciency. Women with FXIII deficiency are particularly at risk for miscarriages. Consequently, prophylaxis is often used during pregnancy to prevent fetal loss. Treatment includes FXIII concentrate and, if unavailable, cryopre cipitate, which has a higher concentration of FXIII than fresh frozen plasma."

The diagnosis of FXI deficiency is suspected by a prolonged aPTT, normal PT, and normal thrombin time. The diagnosis is confirmed by check ing FXI activity. Treatment is based on antifibrinolytic agents (especially if surgery or bleeding in an area of high fibrinolytic activity), fresh frozen plasma, and FXI concentrate.

For this reason, FXII is not thought to play a critical role in in vivo hemostasis. Due to the lack of clinical manifestations from FXII deficiency, it is often diagnosed incidentally on blood work drawn preoperatively or routine clinic visits. The aPTT in XII deficiency patients is often markedly pro longed well beyond what is expected in hemophilia A, he mophilia B, or FXI deficiency. Patients are not at increased risk of bleeding with surgery and therefore can proceed without any preoperative treatment once the diagnosis is confirmed by checking FXII activity levels."

Over the last 2 months he and  his wife have noticed increased spontaneous joint bleed - ing with minor activity. He has had two ankle bleeds last  month, which resolved with two doses of FVIII concen - trate each. This morning he developed a spontaneous knee  bleed, and after taking one dose of FVIII concentrate 25 u/ kg this morning, his FVIII activity is 70% in clinic.     Which of the following should be recommended at this  point",D,"Heyde syndrome is described as an association be tween aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, usually due to angiodysplastic sites.

Which of the following is the best recommendation for  treatment of the patient’s bleeding,C,"This patient’s immunologic assay for heparin/PF4 an tibodies was negative, therefore ruling out heparin in duced thrombocytopenia. Instead, the cause of her drug induced thrombocytopenia is abciximab, a chimeric (human murine) Fab fragment that is specific for plate let GPIIb/IIIa. Abciximab blocks binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb/IIIa. Thrombocytopenia can occur in 12% of patients on recurrent exposure and up to 2% of patients on first exposure due to naturally occurring antibod ies that recognize the murine component of this drug. More common mechanisms of drug induced immune thrombocytopenia include drug dependent platelet an tibodies (e.g., quinine), hapten induced antibodies (e.g., penicillin), fiban dependent antibodies (e.g., tirofiban and eptifibatide), drug independent platelet autoan tibodies (e.g., gold, procainamide, sulfonamides), and formation of immune complexes (e.g., unfractionated heparin)."

Other causes of a prolonged thrombin time include dissemi nated intravascular coagulation, anticoagulants that in hibit thrombin such as heparin or direct thrombin inhibi tors, or acquired antibodies to thrombin. Cryoprecipitate contains higher concentrations of fibrinogen than FFP and is a preferred treatment in fibrinogen disorders. Fibrinogen concentrate would also be a correct option for management. FVIII/vWF concentrate is used in the treatment of von Willebrand disease. DDVP is used in the treatment of mild hemophilia A. rVIIa is used for treatment of hemophilia with inhibitors or for congenital FVII deficiency."
A 58-year-old man with a history of type I von Willebrand  disease plans to have two teeth extracted in 1 week. He  has utilized epsilon aminocaproic acid (Amicar) follow - ing previous dental extractions with adequate control of  bleeding. Which statement best describes the mechanism  of action of epsilon aminocaproic acid,C,"This patient has no prior history of bleeding and now presents with life threatening bleeding. This clinical history combined with a prolonged PTT that does not completely correct on 1:1 mixing study should raise the flag for an acquired FVIII autoantibody. While uncom mon (1 in a million), this disease is associated with a high mortality between 8% and 22%. Approximately 50% of cases are associated with a predisposing con dition such as an autoimmune disease, pregnancy, underlying hematologic malignancy or solid tumor, infections, or use of certain medications. Interestingly the bleeding pattern is different than that of congeni tal hemophilia patients with acquired alloantibodies, presenting with subcutaneous, mucosal, gastrointesti nal, and CNS hemorrhages, rather than hemarthrosis. The treatment of an acquired FVIII inhibitor is two fold: treatment of the underlying bleed and treatment to eradicate the inhibitor. In cases of life threatening bleeding, bypassing agents such as rFVIIa or prothrom bin complex concentrates should be used to stop bleed ing, as even large dose FVIII concentrates will not be effective. Treatment directed at eradicating the under lying inhibitor typically includes immunosuppressive agents (e.g., steroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, cy closporine, or vincristine). While these agents should be started concurrently with bypassing agents, response in inhibitor titers may take weeks, and therefore the best first line treatment remains bypassing agents for treat ment of a life threatening bleed."

Since he is having minor dental surgery and the target peak FVIII activity is 30%–50%, DDAVP should suffice for preoperative management. Caution should be used in choosing the right dose of DDAVP for hemophilia patients. A low concentration formula tion of intranasal DDAVP of 0.1 mg/mL (vs. 1.5 mg/mL used in hemophilia or von Willebrand disease) is avail able for the treatment of diabetes insipidus and prima ry nocturnal enuresis. This formulation is not effective for the treatment of hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease. DDAVP should be used whenever possible to avoid the high cost and minimize the exogenous FVIII concentrate exposure and thus risk of inhibitor devel opment. As an adjunct to DDAVP , the patient can also be treated postoperatively with an oral antifibrinolytic such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for 3–5 days. Antifibrinolytics are particularly useful in the prevention of mucous membrane bleeding of the nose, oropharynx, and genitourinary tract, because secretions from these sites naturally contain fibrinolytic enzymes."

When the PT is only 2 second prolonged, it will likely correct on 1:1 mixing, even if there is a mild inhibitor present. However, an isolated prolongation of a PT with a normal aPTT and a history of bleeding are consistent with factor VII deficiency. The clinical phenotypes of factor VII deficient individuals range from asymptomatic to severe characterized by life threatening and disabling symptoms. In females, menorrhagia affects approximately two thirds of indi viduals. The PTT 1:1 mix would not be helpful as the PTT was normal. The thrombin time reflects the conver sion of fibrinogen to fibrin and is typically prolonged as a result of unfractionated heparin exposure, elevated D dimer/fibrin split products, or acquired or congenital deficiencies of fibrinogen, none of which are consistent with this patient’s history.

In fact, given the advances in clotting fac tor replacement over the last decades, many patients with hemophilia are living well beyond age 60 and are facing issues on how to best manage underlying cardi ovascular risk. Just as in patients without hemophilia, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation poses a risk for thrombo embolism, which can be stratified based upon underly ing risk factors using the CHADS 2 or CHADS2 Vasc scoring system. This patient has a CHADS 2 score of 4, corresponding to an 11%/year risk of stroke. Given this high risk, he can be considered for prophylaxis for stroke prevention. Aspirin has not been effective in preventing stroke in high risk patients and is there fore not the best option in this case. Similarly, using warfarin to target a subtherapeutic INR has not been shown effective. A reasonable approach would there fore include warfarin targeting an INR of 2.0–3.0 or a direct oral anticoagulant, as was recently put forward by an expert consensus panel. There remains debate about the use of direct oral anticoagulants in the set ting of hemophilia. While they have been shown effec tive to reduce stroke risk in atrial fibrillation and have short half lives, the current lack of reversal agent and monitoring target may make warfarin more ideal in the hemophilic population."
A 31-year-old G1P0 with severe type 1 von Willebrand  disease presents in active labor at 38 weeks gestation  while on vacation to visit her family. She has been under  the care of a high-risk obstetrician during her pregnancy  and has not had any complications. Your hospital does  not have the ability to rapidly determine vWF antigen  or activity levels. Her CBC is normal. The patient tells  you that her baseline vWF activity level is “10%” and  that she has had levels of “56% to 70%” throughout her  pregnancy.     What is the next best step in the management of this pa - tient’s imminent delivery,B,"This patient has what appears to be an autosomal rather than an X linked disorder, making hemophilia A carrier status less likely. Type 2 N von Willebrand disease can mimic the phenotype of mild hemophilia A, with soft tis sue and joint bleeds. The disorder is inherited in an au tosomal recessive fashion as compared with hemophilia A, which is inherited in a sex linked recessive fashion, and therefore affects men and women equally. In the plasma, FVIII is protected from degradation by vWF. In type 2N vWD, von Willebrand factor is unable to bind FVIII, thereby leading to a decreased half life of FVIII in the plasma. Because 2N VWD arises from a point muta tion in vWF, affecting only the FVIII binding site, vWF antigen and activity and multimeric analysis remains normal. When one does genetic analysis of hemophilia A, one starts with testing for the intron 22 mutation, which is present in about one third of individuals, so whole gene sequencing would not be the correct answer. Platelet ag gregation studies would not be abnormal in any disorder affecting FVIII levels."
"A 68-year-old with type 1 von Willebrand disease pre - sents with a recent diagnosis of nephrolithiasis after the  onset of abdominal pain and gross hematuria. Of late,  he has also noted some melena and epistaxis. His hemo - globin has not changed from baseline values. He has  had a colonoscopy 2 weeks ago that was of good pre - parative quality and did not show any polyps or masses.   His vWF activity level is 15%. He has previously re - sponded well to DDAVP . He is not taking aspirin or  NSAIDs.     Which of the following is the best treatment option for the  vWF-associated mucocutaneous bleeding in this male pa - tient",D,"Type 1 von Willebrand disease manifests with low levels of von Willebrand activity and antigen levels. These lev els are impacted positively by estrogen and subsequently rise with pregnancy. Postpartum levels drop precipi tously and reach baseline levels by 3 weeks. While this patient likely does not require administration of DDAVP or vWF replacement since her prepartum vWF levels are greater than 50 IU/L, she may require administration of replacement products in the postpartum period in order to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. As type I vWD is autosomal dominant, the baby is also at risk of having vWD, and forceps and vacuum extraction are relatively contraindicated."
12   best fits those of a patient with coagulopathy secondary to  liver disease,C,"The ureters contain a high amount of fibrinolytic activ ity due to an abundant supply of urokinase. Inhibiting fibrinolytic activity with agents such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid in patients with gross hematuria can therefore allow blood clots to form within the ureters, and therefore use of antifibrinolytic agents is cautioned in patients with known hematuria."
"6 g/dL, normal WBC, and  platelets of 560,000 × 109/L. MCV is 68 fL. The PFA-100  shows closure times of 280 seconds in the collagen/ epinephrine cartridge and 180 seconds in the collagen/ ADP cartridge. PT/INR are within reference ranges.  aPTT is 72 seconds and corrects fully with 1:1 mixing.     Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis",A,"Nearly all clotting factors are synthesized in the liver, with the exception of FVIII, which is at least in part syn thesized in endothelial cells. Because of this, in the coagu lopathy of liver disease, there will be deficiencies in all clotting factors, except FVIII. In disseminated intravas cular coagulation (such as in line C), there is a general consumption of clotting factors with increased PT and de crease in all clotting factors, including FVIII. In vitamin K deficiency (B), only the vitamin K dependent factors will be reduced (II, VII, IX, X, C, and S) and the PT will be prolonged."
A 55-year-old man with severe hemophilia A presents to  the emergency department with headache and vomiting  after falling and hitting his head on stone steps. He nor - mally self-administers 2000 units of recombinant factor  VIII for treatment of hemarthroses. The patient has normal  vital signs and is noted to have a large temporoparietal he - matoma of his scalp. Pupils are symmetric and reactive.  His weight is 80 kg.     Which is the most appropriate step to take in the manage - ment of this patient,B,"This patient appears to have a congenital bleeding dis order inherited in an autosomal rather than an X linked fashion, thus making hemophilia A or B less likely. The aPTT is quite prolonged and corrects with 1:1 mixing, suggesting there is a factor deficiency. While deficiency of factor XII can cause aPTT prolongation to this de gree, it is not associated with a hemorrhagic tendency. Factor XI deficiency leads to a bleeding pattern more Coagulation 280 characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding, including heavy menstrual bleeding and postsurgical bleeding. While this history is consistent with von Willebrand dis ease, the patient’s aPTT is too high for a patient with this disorder. The prolonged PFA 100 is a red herring, since this test is prolonged in patients with both anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <100,000 × 109/L). While essential thrombocy tosis can be associated with both platelet dysfunction as well as an acquired von Willebrand disease, this patient’s elevated platelet count is reactive because of bleeding and iron deficiency."
"5 seconds, aPTT 72 seconds. aPTT 1:1 mix is 42 seconds immediate and 64 seconds after 1 hour  incubation at 37°C.     Therapy with recombinant activated FVII is recommend - ed. Which of the following measurements is the best way  to follow the hemostatic efficacy of this therapy",B,"This patient has hemophilia A and has suffered head trauma. The patient should receive factor VIII emergent ly, and this should precede any imaging. In addition, pa tients with suspected intracranial hemorrhage should be given factor VIII sufficient to raise the FVIII level to 100%. Since each unit of administered FVIII will raise the pa tient’s factor VIII level by 2%, raising the current patient’s factor VIII level from a baseline, which we presume to be less than 1% (by definition, since he is known to have severe hemophilia A), we must administer 50 units per kg, or 4000 units. Home treatment of hemarthroses, by contrast, requires raising the FVIII level to only 30%–50%, so giving the patient his home dose would significantly underdose him for a suspected head bleed. Measuring a baseline FVIII level would take too long—treat first—test later. And imaging with either CT (preferred for suspect ed head bleed) or MRI should be deferred until factor VIII is administered."
"A 55-year-old man with mild hemophilia A and a base - line FVIII level of 12% to 15% presents with flank pain  and gross hematuria. PMHx is otherwise notable for a  history of renal calculi. He denies fever. Physical exami - nation shows a man, rocking in pain. He is afebrile, and  tachycardic to 110 bpm. The urinalysis shows 4+ blood,  no organisms, and no WBCs. The electrolytes, BUN, and  creatinine are normal.     Which of the following agents is currently contraindicated  in this patient",B,"This patient has acquired hemophilia, as evidenced by the absence of prior personal or family history of bleed ing. She has a normal PT, but a prolonged aPTT. The pro longation does not fully correct with 1:1 mixing (though the number does shorten, it does not return to the normal range), and incubation leads to re prolongation of the aPTT. These lab findings are pathognomonic of acquired hemophilia. rVIIa is approved for treatment of acquired hemophilia. When given in therapeutic doses, rVIIa can bind to the surface of activated (not resting) platelets, where it can substitute for the fVIIIa/IXa complex to gen erate fXa from fX. Administration of rfVIIa can lead to shortening of the PT and aPTT, but these effects are seen at doses far smaller than therapeutic doses, so following standard coagulation assays is not helpful. In addition, measuring fVII activity level is also not helpful, since measurement of the fVII activity does NOT correlate with the Xase activity on the surface of platelets. Lastly, rVIIa administration does not affect fVIII activity levels. The hemostatic effect is thus measured with crude measures, such as the dimensions of the hematoma, the degree of hematuria, and the measurement of the hemoglobin level."
"5 g/dL, platelets  120,000 × 109/L. The WBC and differential are normal.     Which of the following represents the best therapy to rec - ommend preoperatively",C,"Hemophilia A can be treated with either plasma de rived or recombinant fVIII. Desmopressin can also be used in mild hemophilia A, leading to release of pre formed stores of FVIII from endothelial cells. Cryo precipitate also contains factor VIII, in addition to von Willebrand factor, and can be used for hemostatic use in cases when there are no other options avail able, but its use carries the risk of nonpurified blood product transfusion, including TRALI and infectious transmission. Antifibrinolytic agents (epsilon amino caproic acid and tranexamic acid) are useful adjuncts for treatment of bleeding on mucosal surfaces, but their use is absolutely contraindicated in upper pole urinary bleeding, potentially leading to ureteral obstruction by clotted blood and resultant hydronephrosis."
13  is the most likely pattern of  vWF antigen and vWF activity for this patient,D,"The patient has a history of von Willebrand disease. She has a mismatch between vWF activity and antigen of less than 0.5, suggestive of a type 2 VWD. Though antigen lev els are within normal range, this may have been driven up by use of oral contraceptive agents, which can cause elevations in vWF levels. Type 2B vWD is associated with thrombocytopenia and is due to a “gain of function” mu tation, leading to a vWF molecule with an increased af finity for platelets, leading to inappropriate platelet bind ing and clearance. Notably, patients with type 2B vWD should not receive treatment with desmopressin, since it leads to release of this abnormally sticky vWF, with ex acerbation of thrombocytopenia. Again, cryoprecipitate can be used but is inferior to purified, virally inactivated von Willebrand factor concentrates. While antifibrinolytic treatment with either amino caproic acid or tranexamic acid would be useful adjunctive therapy, they should not be used as sole therapy for a patient with a type 2 vWD having surgery on a mucocutaneous surface involving the airway. Recombinant factor VIII contains no vWF and would not be appropriate treatment for type 2B vWD. Intermediate purity factor VIII concentrates have large quantities of vWF along with fVIII are virally inactivated and would be the treatment of choice."
"5 seconds,  aPTT 60 seconds, and 1:1 aPTT mix is 28 seconds.     Which of the following laboratory test is most likely to  lead to the correct diagnosis",B,"Severe cardiac aortic valvular disease has long been as sociated with development of gastrointestinal arterio venous malformations. This syndrome, known as Heyde syndrome, is now known to be due to shear destruction of the high molecular weight multimers of von Wille brand factor. This same pathophysiology underlies the bleeding seen in patients with continuous flow left ven tricular assist devices and is a problematic management problem. The pattern of vWF antigen and activity will be of a type 2 pattern, with activity much lower than antigen."
"She is treated with vitamin K and four-factor prothrombin  complex concentrate, with complete resolution of bleed - ing and correction of clotting times over the course of 3  days. Endoscopy shows no definitive source of bleeding.  She returns with recurrent bleeding and similar prolonga - tion of PT and aPTT, as well as coagulation factor activity  levels 5 days after discharge from the hospital.     Which of the following diagnostic tests is most likely to  lead to the correct diagnosis",E,"Acquired VWD is one of the bleeding disorders associ ated with plasma cell dyscrasias. It is caused by binding and clearance of von Willebrand factor by the mono clonal paraprotein. vWF levels tend to be severely de pressed, as is factor VIII. Because the cause of the low fVIII is decreased survival due to low/absent vWF lev els, the aPTT will be prolonged and will fully correct with 1:1 mix (as opposed to an autoantibody to fVIII as in acquired hemophilia). Factor X deficiency can result from amyloidosis, another plasma cell dyscrasia, but this factor deficiency leads to prolongation of both the PT as well as the aPTT. A lupus inhibitor would prolong the aPTT, but not correct with 1:1 mixing and not lead to bleeding."
"5  g/L. Bone marrow biopsy shows 3% monoclonal plasma  cells and pinkish material, which gives apple green bire - fringence on Congo red staining.     What is the most likely diagnosis",D,"Munchhausen syndrome manifesting as ingestion of superwarfarins is a well described clinical entity. Super warfarins are rodenticides that act as warfarin does (in hibition of vitamin K recycling) to lead to coagulopathy, Coagulation 281 but differ from warfarin in their extreme lipophilic nature, leading to prolonged half life. Patients present with bleeding and deficiency of the vitamin K depend ent clotting factors. They can respond initially to admin istration of vitamin K, but because of the very prolonged half life of the superwarfarins, the patients rapidly re lapse without prolonged therapy. Assays for warfarin and the many different superwarfarins are performed with HPLC and are individualized and do not cross re act with each other, so a negative warfarin level does not mean that a superwarfarin is not present. A superwar farin panel is offered at many commercial laboratories. Normal levels of factor V (or any other vitamin K de pendent clotting factor) suggest that liver failure is not the cause of the coagulopathy, and thus acetaminophen overdose or Budd Chiari syndrome are less likely poten tial diagnoses."
"9, 2 g lower than baseline. Platelet count  and WBC are normal. PT is normal. Factor VIII activity  level is less than 1%.     Which of the following is the most appropriate agent to  administer now",D,"The patient has systemic amyloidosis based on a mono clonal paraprotein and positive Congo red staining on bone marrow biopsy. The patient has a prolonged PT and aPTT, both of which correct with mixing, suggesting a de ficiency of a clotting factor in the common pathway (i.e., either fibrinogen, factor II, V , or X). Amyloidosis is known to be associated with acquired factor X deficiency. The mechanism is felt to be binding of factor X to the amyloid protein leading to accelerated clearance. There is not an inhibitor to factor X (as evidenced by the fact that the 1:1 mixing completely corrects the abnormalities). Acquired VWD can be associated with a plasma cell dyscrasia, but does not prolong the PT. A dysfibrinogenemia usually prolongs the TCT and is less associated with plasma cell dyscrasias."
3 μg/kg DDAVP . There is no family history  of any bleeding disorder. vWF antigen and activity levels  are both above 100%. Factor VIII genotyping shows no  mutations in the factor VIII gene.     Which of the following tests is the most likely to yield the  correct diagnosis,D,"Patients with hemophilia A are at risk for developing inhibitors to factor VIII, which are neutralizing alloan tibodies to FVIII activity. Such inhibitors develop in about 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A (base line factor VIII of <1%) and generally occur in child hood within the first 20–100 exposure days. Patients with mild hemophilia have factor VIII levels ranging between 5% and 25% at baseline, and thus mild hemo philiacs bleed only with surgery or trauma. Patients with mild hemophilia are exposed to less factor VIII, and thus when they do develop an inhibitor, they do so at a later age. This patient has developed an inhibitor, as evidenced by a factor VIII activity that is now unde tectable (i.e., <1%). Thus factor VIII administration is likely to be ineffective, as is cryoprecipitate or DDAVP . Recombinant activated factor VII is approved for treat ment of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia and inhibitors."
7 g/dL Hct 38% aPTT 89 seconds     Which of the following would best control his coagulopathy,D,"This woman has low levels of FVIII that initially rise, but then fall too quickly after DDAVP . This suggests a short ened FVIII half life that is characteristic of the Normandy type (2N) of vWD. In this disorder, there is a mutation in the FVIII binding site of vWF. The standard vWF anti gen and activity assays are normal, and the FVIII level is low due to accelerated clearance. It can be diagnosed by sequencing the D domain of the vWF gene (the fVIII bind ing site) or by doing assays of the ability of the patient’s vWF to bid FVIII. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Low factor VIII levels in a woman can be caused by extreme lyonization of a female carrier of the gene for hemophilia A, but we are told this woman’s FVIII geno type was normal. FVIII inhibitors block function and do not shorten half life. Abnormal sensitivity to low dose ristocetin is a hallmark of type 2B, not type 2N vWD. vWF propeptide levels that are higher than the vWF antigen levels are a hallmark of type 1 Vicenza vWD, characterized by shortened half life of vWF, not FVIII. The collagen binding assay is another functional assay for vWF that would not add to this patient’s diagnostic evaluation."
"A 65-year-old woman with a 20-year history of atrial  fibrillation managed with dabigatran for the past 2  years presents with acute appendicitis necessitating  surgical intervention. She reports her last dose of da - bigatran was 6 hours prior to surgery. Her physical  examination is remarkable for a temperature of 102°F,  pulse of 110, and guarding and rebound in her left  lower quadrant.     Which of the following tests would best predict her level  of anticoagulation",D,"Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds dabigatran with an affinity 350 times that of thrombin. As a consequence, idarucizumab binds both dabigatran and dabigatran bound thrombin, and has shown significant efficacy in reversing the effects of da bigatran. In one study, 100% of the patients studied had full reversal with the administration of idarucizumab. Four component pccs are useful in reversing warfa rin as is fresh frozen plasma. Cryoprecipitate does not contain thrombin and would not reverse dabigatran. Rituximab is sometimes useful in treating hemophilia patients with inhibitors, but would not be effective in this setting."
"A 27-year-old woman presents with pain and swelling in  her left leg 24 hours after beginning clomiphene for in - fertility. The patient has been otherwise healthy and cur - rently takes no other medications. She has no family his - tory of thrombosis. On exam she has a left thigh that is 4  cm larger than the right. She has edema in her ankle, and  all pulses are intact. She is not currently pregnant. A du - plex ultrasound confirms the presence of an acute DVT.  On further evaluation, she is found to be heterozygous  for the prothrombin 20210 mutation.     How should she be managed",E,"Information regarding the level of anticoagulation may be important, such as in the scenario presented where im minent surgery is needed in a patient on dabigatran. Un fortunately, common coagulation tests (PT, aPTT, ACT) are inadequate, especially in lower plasma levels of the drug. As such, the PT, aPTT, and activated clotting times are typically normal in the setting of therapeutic levels of dabigatran. The reptilase time is useful in diagnosing a dysfibrinogenemia but is not helpful in monitoring pa tients on dabigatran. The dilute thrombin time is able to accurately predict therapeutic and subtherapeutic dabi gatran serum concentrations over a wide range in a linear fashion."
She has no  family or personal history of thrombosis or miscarriage.  She has no rheumatologic disorder and does not smoke or  take oral contraceptives. She is not pregnant and does not  plan on becoming pregnant.     How should she be managed,B,"The patient has a DVT that was provoked by the admin istration of clomifene for infertility. Patients with a pro voked DVT have a lower risk of recurrence than those with an unprovoked DVT. Other factors that decrease the risk for recurrence include female gender, absence of an underlying malignancy, and younger age. Heterozygo sity for the prothrombin mutation does not appear to be a risk factor for recurrent thrombosis. As such, the patient should be managed with short term anticoagulation with enoxaparin followed by warfarin. Warfarin alone would be unacceptable, as the duration to anticoagulation with warfarin is several days, and warfarin will deplete pro tein C before it exerts its full anticoagulant effect. TPA is limited to patients with life or limb threatening throm bosis, and even then, the data on safety and efficacy are not clear."
"A 25-year-old woman is found to be heterozygous for the  MTHFR C677T mutation while being evaluated due to  a DVT and PE that occurred in her sister. The patient is  healthy, takes no medications, and is not pregnant. She  has never had a thrombotic episode. She eats a normal  diet. Further evaluation revealed a serum homocysteine level of 15 μm/L that was top normal for the laboratory  in which it was tested. The remainder of her workup for  thrombophilia was unremarkable.     How should she be managed",A,A prospective randomized double blind study compar ing low dose aspirin with placebo for the prevention of thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies found that aspirin was no more effective than placebo in the primary prevention of thrombotic events in patients Coagulation 282 who did not have SLE. There is similarly no evidence that warfarin is indicated to prevent thrombosis in patients with APL antibodies with a low risk of thrombosis. Rivar oxaban has not been adequately studied in the primary prevention of thrombosis in patients with asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies.
A 27-year-old woman at 33 weeks gestation presents  to the emergency room with crampy abdominal pain  and bleeding. She is found to have fetal demise in  utero. The obstetrician suspects antiphospholipid anti - body syndrome and begins the appropriate laboratory   evaluation.     Which of the following laboratory studies would support  the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome,E,"The C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene is common, found in more than 35% of the US population. Patients with this mutation may have modest elevations in se rum homocysteine levels. Metaanalyses show no corre lation with thrombosis in United States patients where grains are supplemented with folate. Although B vi tamin and folate supplementation may lower serum homocysteine levels, there is little evidence that such supplementation will lower the risk for thrombosis. As such, the MTHFR mutation should not be part of rou tine thrombophilia screening and should not be treated if detected."
9 mg/dL Serum electrolytes Normal Liver function tests Markedly elevated AST and ALT     Which of the following tests would be most likely to diag - nose the condition predisposing to hepatic vein thrombo - sis in this patient,C,"Classification criteria for the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome include both clinical and laboratory criteria. Clinical criteria include either vascular thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity. Laboratory criteria includes the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG and/or IgM present in medium or high titer (>40 MPL), and/or anti B2 glycoprotein IgG and/or IgM present in titer greater than 99th percentile. Of importance to meet the diagnostic criteria for APLS, there must be sustained abnormalities on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. The dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) is one of multiple tests used to detect a lupus anticoagulant. An elevated aPTT may be suggestive of a lupus antico agulant, but is nonspecific and may be caused by many etiologies."
"A healthy 23-year-old woman is pregnant with her first  child. She has no prior medical or surgical history. Her  sister recently developed a left lower extremity DVT  while on estrogen-containing contraceptives and was  found to be heterozygous for the prothrombin gene muta - tion (P20210).

You recommend:  ",A,"The Budd Chiari syndrome is due to thrombosis of the hepatic veins and/or intrahepatic or suprahepatic IVC. An underlying disorder can be identified in over 80% of the cases of Budd Chiari syndrome. As many as 50% of cases may be due to an underlying chronic myelopro liferative disorder, and JAK2 (V617F) testing is recom mended in any case where an obvious etiology is not identified. The women presented in this vignette had microcytosis in the setting of an elevated hemoglobin/ hematocrit, platelet count, and white count making pre viously undiagnosed polycythemia very likely. A JAK2 mutation can be identified in more than 90% of cases of polycythemia vera (Answer A). PNH, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, AT 3 deficiency, and factor V Lei den have all been identified as causes of hepatic vein thrombosis, but would be less likely in this case given the laboratory findings supporting the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (choices B–E)."
"A 54-year-old man was recently diagnosed with a pro - voked popliteal RLE DVT at the end of a prolonged  hospital course for cellulitis. His past medical history Coagulation 260 consists of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40%,  chronic kidney disease with a CrCl of 40 mL/min, and  hypertension on metoprolol. His appetite is poor, and he  is frequently on and off antibiotics. He is otherwise ready  to go home today and is anxious for discharge. He would  like to avoid injectable medications and to be discharged  as soon as possible. He is currently on no medications  that would interact with warfarin or any of the new oral  anticoagulants.     Which of the following anticoagulants do you recom - mend",C,"The American College of Physicians has produced evi dence based guidelines for anticoagulation in many clini cal situations, including for pregnant women with throm bophilia, but no prior thrombotic history. In pregnant women with a weak thrombophilic mutation, such as heterozygosity for the prothrombin gene mutation, and no prior or family history, only clinical surveillance is rec ommended (choice A). In pregnant women with no prior thrombotic history, but a positive family history, postpar tum prophylaxis is recommended (choice C). In pregnant women known to be homozygous for the factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210 mutation with a family history of thrombosis, antepartum prophylaxis with postpartum prophylaxis or intermediate dose anticoagulation has been recommended (choices B and E). Treatment doses of anticoagulation antepartum and postpartum are gener ally not recommended in the absence of prior thrombosis (choice D)."
"3 kg/m2, and an erythematous and swollen  right leg. A D-dimer was performed and noted to be  markedly elevated, prompting her referral to the emer - gency room. Once there, an ultrasound was performed  that showed the presence of a right popliteal DVT extend - ing into the trifurcation. She was instructed to stop her  estrogens and therapeutic anticoagulation with a low- molecular-weight heparin was initiated. Due to issues  with her insurance, she was bridged to warfarin, which  she has remained upon for the last 4 months without any  hemorrhagic complications. Review of the entirety of her  PT/INR values show that she has remained within the  therapeutic range.     Which of the following should be recommended",B,"The choice of a proper anticoagulant is very complex and depends on patient factors, patient preferences, as well as health care and social constraints. This patient has a com plex history and multiple comorbidities, including poor appetite, heart failure, and CKD. In addition, he is request ing prompt discharge and no injectable anticoagulants. Apixiban would be the best of the choices listed, as it has the least renal clearance and is approved as initial therapy for VTE without need for an initial parenteral agent (choice B). Warfarin use would be difficult with his poor diet and frequent antibiotic use (choice A). The FDA approved in dications for dabigatran and edoxaban require treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5–7 days prior to their introduction, based on the design of clinical trials leading to approval. Thus in this patient who requests discharge as soon as possible, neither of these agents would be the best choice (choices C and D). In addition, dabigatran has sig nificant renal clearance and therefore would again not be the best choice. Fondaparinux is an injectable agent and is also cleared renally, so would not be the best choice in this case (choice E)."
"The patient is a 39-year-old woman, with no significant  past medical history and on no medications, developed  vague right upper quadrant pain over the course of a  week. Her symptoms progressed to include malaise, ano - rexia, abdominal distention, and scleral icterus. She pre - sented to the emergency room, where marked transamini - tis and hyperbilirubinemia was noted. She was admitted  to medicine, where a full workup ensued, including Dop - pler ultrasound of her liver. This was significant for he - patic vein thrombosis in the absence of collateral forma - tion, prompting initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation  with unfractionated heparin. Hematology is called for a  hypercoagulable evaluation.     Which of the following is the most appropriate test to send",A,"Based upon her history, this patient’s thrombotic event was clearly provoked by the initiation of exogenous es trogens, further exacerbated by her age, morbid obesity, and use of tobacco. As a result, only 3 months of thera peutic anticoagulation is indicated. There is no indication for continuing with warfarin or transitioning to another anticoagulant. While the PREVENT trial, which used an INR range of 1.5–2.0, showed a reduction of recurrent ve nous thrombosis without an increase of bleeding, a larger and somewhat better designed study (ELATE) showed a higher rate of recurrence with no decrease in hemorrhage in the lower INR range cohort versus standard range. Thus the lower INR range is accompa nied by the same risks as standard therapy, but without the benefits. The use of a low dose direct oral anticoagulant for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism is (currently) FDA approved in patients with idiopathic VTE. As her DVT was clearly provoked, there is no indi cation for continued treatment."
"A 56-year-old man is admitted for additional treatment  of a pulmonary embolism. He was in his usual state of  good, having recently flown from Munich to Chicago,  when he developed progressive right-sided pleuritic  chest pain over the course of 2 days. He presented to  the ER, where a CT angiogram showed the presence of  extensive right main and upper lobar pulmonary artery  thrombus, with opacities in the right upper lung concern - ing for infarction, with radiographic findings of right  heart strain. The patient is admitted to the MICU, where  an emergent transthoracic echocardiogram showed no  evidence of right heart failure, with normal right ven - tricular pressures.

Which of the following is the most appropriate manage - ment at this time",C,"In general, there is a very limited utility in performing thrombophilia evaluations, particularly in the in patient and acute setting. However, there are particular instances where a deliberate evaluation for underlying thrombo philia may be useful. Specifically, in a patient with an abdominal vein thrombosis in the absence of other overt provocative events (surgery, injury, malignancy, etc.), test ing for the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation is indi cated, as this is commonly found. It is not uncommon for Coagulation 283 thrombotic manifestations to precede the development of polycythemia or thrombocytosis. The other hyperco agulable states are much less frequently associated with the Budd Chiari syndrome and can be falsely positive if the patient is on anticoagulation or has just had a recent thrombosis."

He was empirically placed on a bivalirudin infusion  and bridged to warfarin after his platelet count remained  greater than 150 for 2 days, which he remained upon since  that time.      While there have been no hemorrhagic complications  from the use of his warfarin, he has developed progres - sive dyspnea on exertion and was sent to the cardiovas - cular surgery clinic for an evaluation for mitral valve re - placement. Given his comorbidities, it was not felt that he  was an appropriate candidate for either a percutaneous  or minimally invasive laparoscopic approach for repair of  his valve. It was recommended that he undergo an open  mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve on by - pass. Due to his history, Mr. Thomas has been sent to the  Hematology Clinic for recommendations regarding his  use of warfarin and his prior exposure to heparin.Coagulation 261      As his planned surgical date is a month away, which of  the following is the most appropriate recommendation:  ",A,"While the use of unfractionated heparin would be accept able, concurrent administration with antiplatelet therapy is not indicated. Since the patient is without any objective finding of either hemodynamic compromise or severe limb dysfunction, the use of thrombolytics is not warrant ed. As for the placement of a filter, there is no contraindi cation to anticoagulation. In addition, while the presence of a DVT in the setting of “submassive” PE has been used as a justification for filter placement, in a randomized prospective clinical trial, compared with anticoagulation alone, placement of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter for 3 months in addition to anticoagulation provided no benefit in terms of pulmonary embolism recurrence or mortality in patients presenting acute symptomatic pul monary embolism."
278 OD.      Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation,A,"While it is unclear if this was truly a case of heparin induced thrombocytopenia, given the lack of reported thrombosis, only 4 weeks of anticoagulation is recom mended, with 3 months in total if there was a thrombosis. As such, the patient has received more than an adequate course of anticoagulation. For this reason there is no indi cation to either continue or transition to a higher target/ range of warfarin, regardless of what type of valve he is to receive, especially as this will have to stopped prior to surgery. The use of any direct oral anticoagulant is contrain dicated in patients with mechanical heart valves. It was observed in the RE ALIGN trial that the use of dabigatran led to a higher rate of bleeding and thrombosis, leading to the trial’s early discontinuation."
"A 43-year-old woman was diagnosed with a left leg DVT  4 months ago. She was seen at her local ER and started  on rivaroxaban, 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, followed  by 20 mg daily, which she has remained upon without  any hemorrhagic complications. Due to a reported fam - ily history of thrombosis, she underwent a thrombophilia  evaluation through her primary care physician, which  showed the following results",B,"Since the measured heparin/PF4 antibody has decayed to normal, the short term use of heparin for cardiac surgery is recommended. It has been observed that the intraop erative use of heparin is associated with a low risk of HIT, but can increase if used postoperatively. As warfarin will be necessary, bridging with an alternative agent is neces sary. Therefore the postoperative use of heparin or enoxa parin would not be recommended. While some centers will use a direct thrombin inhibi tor for anticoagulation while on bypass, the recommend ed INR target is 3.0, range 2.5–3.5, for a mechanical mitral valve."
8 Lupus anticoagulant Not detected ACA and anti-B2GP1 IgA/IgG/IgM Negative  Which of the following is the most appropriate recom- mendation,E,"While the direct oral anticoagulants are characterized by the lack of need of monitoring their anticoagulant effect, nonetheless, all of these agents exert an effect on many tests of hemostasis. Specifically in this case, the elevated values of protein C and S can be seen in clot based assays, whereas LA panels that employ the use of the chromog enic Xa based assays are particularly affected by the pres ence of an oral Xa inhibitor. Even though a lupus anticoagulant is “present,” (1) the presence of rivaroxaban confounds this diagnosis, and (2) the presence of an antiphospholipid antibody, such as a lupus anticoagulant, must be present after 12 weeks. The presence of a lupus anticoagulant can lead to a positive APCR assay, in the absence of factor V Leiden. However, this would not account for the elevated protein C and S levels, and as noted previously, it is far more like ly that an effect from rivaroxaban is being observed."

The patient has a lupus anticoagulant, as there is (1) the prolongation of a phospholipid dependent clot ting assay; (2) this is not overcome with mixing; (3) it shows phospholipid dependence; and (4) there is no specific factor inhibitor. However, she does not fulfill the criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome, as there are no clinical criteria to accompany the LA, such as re current pregnancy loss or documented thrombosis. As such, the empiric initiation of any treatment, be it an anticoagulant, antithrombotic, or antirheumatic thera py, is not indicated."
"A 34-year-old woman has been on combined oral con - traceptive therapy for 7 years following the birth of her  second child. She recently injured her ankle in a skiing  accident, for which she was placed in a cast. Two weeks  later, she was noted to have sustained thrombosis of  one of her paired tibial veins and a peroneal vein. No  proximal DVT was noted. She was started on enoxapa - rin, but her OB/gyn was concerned for thrombophilia  to explain the thrombosis, as she had been on estro - gens for years without any prior problems. This was  significant for showing heterozygosity for the C677T  mutation in MTHFR.  The OB/gyn has recommended  stopping her estrogen, started folate/B-vitamin sup - plementation, and indefinite anticoagulation. In addi - tion, she has been sent to hematology for evaluation  and treatment of her inherited thrombophilia.      Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation at this time",C,"The abnormal thrombin time is indicative of either a thrombin inhibitor (such as heparin or dabigatran, not the oral Xa inhibitors such as apixaban) or a disorder of fibrinogen. In the case of a patient with both throm botic and hemorrhagic manifestations, the presence of a dysfibrinogenemia should be suspected. Reptilase is snake venom that is insensitive to the presence of hepa rin, and the reptilase time is abnormal in the setting of a dysfibrinogenemia. If the reptilase assay is abnormal, this is highly suggestive of a dysfibrinogenemia, fol lowing which a fibrinogen antigen:activity ratio should be obtained. While an elevated FVIII level is observed and has been associated with thrombotic events, it is also an acute phase reactant. Furthermore, there are no known F8 sequence changes that are associated with elevated levels. Performing a lupus anticoagulant evaluation, as well as clot based protein C and S assays, are bound to be con founded by the presence of apixaban, and should not be performed."

Which of the following is the most important next step,D,"With respect to the heterozygosity for the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, at best, it can be said there is conflicting data on its relevance to thrombosis. However, it is widely felt that there is no relation of this polymorphism to cardi ovascular events, is not associated with venous thrombo sis, and that supplementation with folate/B6 compounds does nothing to alter future events. Her thrombosis was distal and provoked, which provides no justification for prolonged anticoagulation.Coagulation 284"
A 35-year-old woman develops an acute superficial femo - ral vein thrombosis 3 days after undergoing a hysterec - tomy for uterine fibroids. She has no prior personal or  family history of thrombosis. She is initially started on  weight-based low-molecular-weight heparin and tran - sitioned to a direct oral anticoagulant of discharge. She  comes to see you in clinic 2 weeks later for recommenda - tions on length of anticoagulation. Her physical exam and  laboratory results are normal.     What is the most appropriate recommendation for dura - tion of anticoagulation,C,"Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a unique cause of thrombocytopenia that is associated with throm bosis rather than bleeding. HIT should be considered for patients who have been exposed to heparin in the pre vious 100 days and in whom thrombocytopenia has de veloped, especially thrombocytopenia associated with thrombosis, as is suggested by this patient’s leg exam. The pathophysiology of HIT is characterized by autoanti bodies that develop against complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) with heparin. HIT generally occurs 5–10 days after heparin exposure, but can occur within 24 hours if there is a history of recent (<30 days) heparin exposure. The like lihood of HIT can be calculated using the 4T score. This patient has a high pretest probability based on a platelet count of at least 20 × 109/L and a 50% decline from base line, clear onset of 5–10 days, and no apparent other cause for the thrombocytopenia. If he is diagnosed with a DVT based on his leg symptoms, this would further increase the likelihood of HIT. The first and most important man agement step is discontinuation of all heparin products, including intravenous or subcutaneous forms or flushes. While heparin associated antibody testing (initially using the immunologic assay and subsequently the functional assay to confirm the diagnosis) can help confirm the di agnosis, the results can take several days to return. In the meantime, appropriate management should not be with held. Oral steroids such as prednisone is used for patients suspected of having immune thrombocytopenia, but does not have a role in the management of HIT. Platelet transfu sions are a relative contraindicated in HIT, and their use is debated."

VTE recurrence risk is highly dependent on the scenario in which the VTE occurred. Patients with a provoked VTE (e.g., by surgery, trauma, prolonged immobility) should be treated with 3 months of anticoagulation, since the recurrence risk is very low compared with unprovoked VTE (recurrence risk is ∼1%–7% compared with 20% at 2 years). Studies have shown that treatment for less than 3 months leads to increased recurrence rates after stopping anticoagulation. Conversely, treat ment for periods longer than 3 months (e.g., 6 months, 12 months, 24 months) does not decrease the recurrence risk once anticoagulation is stopped. Since male patients with an unprovoked VTE (or those with provoked VTE due to a persistent risk factor such as cancer) have a high risk of VTE recurrence, these patients should be offered indefinite anticoagulation. The duration of anticoagula tion for female patients with a first unprovoked VTE is still controversial."
0). He is not on an antiplatelet agent.     Which of the following is the best recommendation for  perioperative management of warfarin,A,"Thrombophilia testing is not indicated in adult patients with a clearly provoked VTE (e.g., VTE after surgery, trauma, or prolonged immobility). Thrombophilia test ing can result in harm if the duration of anticoagulation is inappropriately prolonged—for example, when a patient is mislabeled as having a thrombophilia. Further, nega tive thrombophilia testing could be misinterpreted to suggest a patient dies not have a risk of recurrent throm bosis leading to premature cessation of anticoagulation. Finally, thrombophilia testing is expensive. For VTE oc curring in the setting of a major transient risk factor, such as this patient, thrombophilia testing should not impact decisions on length of anticoagulant therapy. Instead, this patient should receive 3 months of anticoagulation due to the provoked nature of this VTE. The patient does not have protein S or protein C deficiency; rather, she has low protein C and protein S activities, as expected on warfarin therapy. This highlights the fact that if throm bophilia testing is undertaken, clinicians must be aware of scenarios in which thrombophilia results may be inac curate or misleading. Heterozygous FVL mutation does not significantly increase the risk of VTE recurrence and therefore should not impact length of anticoagulation in this patient."
A 64-year-old man is admitted for scheduled total hip ar - throplasty for severe osteoarthritis. He has no personal or  family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). There  is no evidence of bleeding.     Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation for VTE prophylaxis,C,"This patient has a CHADS 2 score (for atrial fibrillation risk of stroke) of 5 (age of at least 75 years, diabetes, hypertension, and history of stroke), which places him at high risk for recurrent thromboembolic event. At the same time, he is undergoing a colonoscopy, which has a low risk of bleeding. Until recently, most patients in this scenario were thought to benefit from bridging anticoag ulation perioperatively by minimizing the risk of throm boembolism without increasing the risk of perioperative bleeding. The recent BRIDGE trial evaluated the need for bridging anticoagulation with LMWH in patients with atrial fibrillation that required warfarin interruption for a procedure or surgery. Patients were randomized to re ceive LMWH bridging or no bridging. LMWH or match ing placebo was administered 3 days before the proce dure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5–10 days after the procedure. Warfarin treatment was stopped 5 days before the procedure and was resumed within 24 hours after the procedure. This study found that forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with LMWH for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of ma jor bleeding."
16 .     Which of the following should be recommended at this time,B,"Patients undergoing certain orthopedic procedures such as total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or hip fracture surgery are at increased risk for VTE. The 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guide lines recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis (Grade 1B) in addition to mechanical prophylaxis in the form of IPCD (Grade 2C). Inferior vena cava filters are being used increasingly for primary prophylaxis in patients at high risk for VTE (e.g., major trauma, orthopedic sur gery, bariatric surgery, and cancer). However, this prac tice is not supported by high level evidence, is costly, and is potentially harmful to the patient. Furthermore, although these filters are inserted for temporary proph ylaxis in this setting, the filter is seldom removed in these patients. The only indication for inferior vena cava filters that has received universal agreement by leading medical professional societies is for patients with acute venous thromboembolism and contraindication to anti coagulation."

Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation at this point,D,"T his patient is on the anticoagulant apixaban, a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor. In patients with life threatening bleeding such as CNS bleeding, patients on this medica tion should be treated with a bypassing agent such as prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant FVIIa. Since apixaban does not deplete but rather inhibits factor Coagulation 285 Xa, replacing factor Xa with fresh frozen plasma is not ex pected to provide hemostasis. Protamine is used for com plete reversal of unfractionated heparin or partial rever sal of low molecular weight heparin. Currently, only one true reversal agent is FDA approved for the direct oral anticoagulants. Idarucizumab is a humanized monoclo nal antibody fragment whose target is the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. It is anticipated that andexanet will be approved by the FDA for reversal of apixaban and ri varoxaban, but as of September 2017, there are no FDA approved reversal agents for the direct oral factor Xa in hibitors."

Which of the following is the most appropriate preopera - tive recommendation for his anticoagulation",D,"The direct oral anticoagulants have been studied and ap proved in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and therefore are not indicated for anticoagulation in patients with valvu lar atrial fibrillation. Further, a recent Phase II study (RE ALIGN) evaluating the efficacy and safety of dabigatran in mechanical heart valves was terminated prematurely due to increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications compared with warfarin. Therefore as yet, the direct oral anticoagulants should not be used in pa tients with mechanical heart valves. With an acceptable time in therapeutic range with warfarin and no bleeding complications on warfarin, this patient should remain on warfarin."
A 24-year-old female with h/o symptomatic right ili - ofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed at  age 22 while on drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol oral  contraceptive is now 8 weeks pregnant with her first  child.

You recommend the following for VTE prophylaxis dur - ing this pregnancy:  ,C,"Apixaban approximately 25% renally cleared. The half life of apixaban is 8–13 hours and prolonged further in renal impairment. Recommendations for cessation of the direct oral anticoagulants preoperatively are based on the pa tient’s renal function and the risk of bleeding with surgery. In this patient with mild renal insufficiency undergoing a surgery with high risk of bleeding, experts recommend stopping apixaban 72 hours prior to surgery. Because he has had no prior stroke or embolic event, does not have a known cardiac thrombus, and his CHADS2 score is less than 4, bridging anticoagulation is not required. The recent BRIDGE trial evaluated the need for bridging anticoagu lation with LMWH in patients with atrial fibrillation that required warfarin interruption for a procedure or surgery. Patients were randomized to receive LMWH bridging or no bridging. LMWH or matching placebo was adminis tered 3 days before the procedure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5–10 days after the procedure.

The ACCP 2012 guidelines recommend that in patients at moderate risk for recurrent VTE (pregnan cy or estrogen related) antepartum prophylactic or in termediate dose LMWH rather than clinical surveillance be used (GRADE 2C). Further, since the postpartum pe riod is the highest risk for VTE recurrence, 6 weeks of pro phylactic or intermediate dose LWMH is recommended over no postpartum prophylaxis (GRADE 2B). Since this patient does not have an acute VTE, there is no current indication for therapeutic anticoagulation."
"4  mg/dL and platelets are 195,000 × 109/L.     What is the best lab to exclude a clinically relevant dabi - gatran level in this bleeding patient",B,"This patient has an upper extremity DVT provoked by an indwelling central catheter. The 2012 ACCP Guidelines recommend that for patients with catheter associated UEDVT and ongoing need for the catheter that is functional (in this case intravenous antibiotics for endocarditis), the catheter should not be removed (GRADE 2C). Patients with proximal UEDVT, regard less of whether catheter associated or whether catheter is removed, should receive a standard course of anti coagulation (i.e., 3 months). Since this is a provoked UEDVT and the catheter will be removed by 3 months, extended therapeutic anticoagulation beyond 3 months is not indicated (GRADE 1B). Finally, in patients with acute UEDVT that involves the axillary or more proxi mal veins, anticoagulant therapy alone over thrombol ysis is recommended (Grade 2C)."

However, in specific circumstances (e.g., in this patient with life threatening bleeding), an accurate laboratory test for determining anticoagulant presence would be desired. Dabigatran is a direct oral antifactor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor. It is approved for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvu lar atrial fibrillation among other indications. In patients with life threatening bleeding, the TT is the best test for qualitative measurement of drug activity. The TT exqui sitely sensitive to dabigatran levels and therefore should not be used for quantification of drug concentration. However, a normal TT excludes the presence of clini cally relevant drug levels, which would be helpful in this case scenario, should the patient require emergent neu rosurgery. A higher degree of linearity exists between the dilute TT with plasma dabigatran concentration across a wide range of levels; however, this test is not readily available at most institutions. The aPTT exhibits a linear dose response relationship with dabigatran levels up to 200–300 ng/mL, but flattens out at higher concentrations, thereby precluding quantitative measurement. Further, since commercial aPTT reagents differ in their sensitivity to dabigatran, the aPTT may not be prolonged, despite the presence “therapeutic” dabigatran levels (which to date have not been defined) if an insensitive reagent is used. The PT is less sensitive to dabigatran levels than the aPTT and may not be prolonged even with suprathera peutic levels of dabigatran. Since dabigatran is an antifac tor IIa inhibitor, an anti Xa activity would not be helpful."
17 .     Which of the following tests is most likely to abnormal in  this patient,B,"This young patient with a cryptogenic stroke likely has antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS), a highly throm bophilic condition associated with both venous and arterial thrombosis. The laboratory diagnosis of APLS requires on two separate occasions at least 12 weeks apart either (1) moderately to highly positive immu noglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti β2 glycoprotein antibodies, (2) moderately to highly positive IgG or IgM anticardiolipin antibodies, or (3) positive lupus anticoagulant. The prolonged PTT and chronic mild thrombocytopenia also is associated with APLS. Antiphospholipid antibodies also predispose to obstetric complications. The other thrombophilias listed are typically associated with venous not arterial thrombosis. Treatment of APLS patients with a cer ebral vascular accident consists of either warfarin or Coagulation 286 aspirin therapy. The JAK2 mutation would be unlikely in the presence of thrombocytopenia and a slightly low hemoglobin, as in this case."
A 17-year-old high school student is diagnosed with a  right lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis 1 week af - ter a left ankle fracture he sustained while playing soc - cer.

The patient’s father has a history of het - erozygous factor V Leiden. The patient’s hypercoagulable  workup revealed homozygosity for factor V Leiden. He is  started on the direct oral anticoagulant Rivaroxaban.     What is the mechanism by which factor V Leiden increas - es the risk of venous thromboembolism,C,"Factor V Leiden refers to a mutation in factor V that leads to resistance to activated protein C inactivation. This pa tient inherited one copy of the factor V Leiden allele from each parent and thus has homozygous factor V Leiden (FVL). The prevalence of homozygous FVL is in 0.1% of Caucasians. FVL homozygosity increases the risk of in cident VTE by approximately 18 fold. The risk for VTE is multiplicative with other risk factors for thrombosis. Protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiency are a result of a congenital or acquired deficiency in these natural anticoagulants. Disruption of annexin V shield on membranes is one mechanism of fetal loss attributed to antiphospholipid antibodies in antiphospholipid syn drome."

This patient had normal liver function tests on presentation, making HELLP syndrome less likely. An ADAMTS 13 activity greater than 5%–10% rules out TTP . C TMA (also known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome) is caused by a dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway, due to an underlying mutation in the complement regu latory proteins. C TMA is usually triggered by infection, although pregnancy and more typically the postpartum state are common triggering events in women. This pa tient has several presenting features of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome including hypertension and significant acute kidney injury in addition to the classic features of TMA and thrombocytopenia. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome can sometimes be distinguished from TTP based on more moderate thrombocytopenia and TMA, more severe renal injury, and inadequate response to TPE. In this patient whose clinical course worsened despite TPE, the monoclonal antibody against terminal comple ment, eculizumab, should be initiated promptly.

Which of the following most accurately represents the eti - ology of this patient’s skin condition",A,"Warfarin inhibits the activation of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. In this patient with an acute DVT, war farin was started with bridging therapy, namely enoxapa rin. However, upon discharge, the patient stopped taking enoxaparin and was solely on a high starting dose of war farin therapy. The patient then presented with signs of warfarin skin necrosis, which usually occurs 3 to 5 days after drug therapy is begun. In one third of cases, warfa rin necrosis occurs in patients with an underlying, innate, and previously unknown deficiency of protein C. The breasts, buttocks, abdomen, and thighs are more susceptible probably due to reduced blood sup ply in adipose tissue. The pathophysiology of warfa rin skin necrosis is due to depletion of the natural an ticoagulant protein C before the inactivation of other vitamin K dependent procoagulant clotting factors with longer half lives. This imbalance leads to a para doxical hypercoagulable milieu in which fibrin clots in microvasculature of the skin. Treatment consists of stopping warfarin and in some cases using fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K to reverse the effects of warfarin. Therapeutic anticoagulation with a parenteral agent should be initiated promptly. Cautious reintroduc tion of warfarin can be attempted in combination with therapeutic bridging. Calciphylaxis and heparin skin necrosis can produce the same results on skin biopsy, but do not fit this clinical scenario."

"A 55-year-old man is diagnosed with a provoked DVT  of the right popliteal vein after undergoing surgery for  a fractured femur sustained in a motor vehicle accident.  During his hospital stay, a thrombophilia workup is  sent. He is found to be heterozygous for the prothrom - bin 20210 mutation. He presents to hematology clinic for  recommendations regarding the duration of anticoagu - lation.     What is the most appropriate recommendation",B,"Heterozygosity for the prothrombin 20210 mutation confers a threefold increased risk of first time VTE. However, heterozygosity for the prothrombin 20210 mutation is not associated with an increased risk of recurrence of VTE. Given this, treatment decisions on duration of anticoagulation are not based on the presence of this mutation. This patient clearly had a provoked DVT; thus 3 months of anticoagulation is recommended."
"A 35-year-old otherwise healthy woman is 22 weeks  pregnant with her first child. She is referred for antico - agulation recommendations. Her past medical history  is negative for VTE; however, her father developed an  unprovoked pulmonary embolism several years ago,  prompting an evaluation for thrombophilia. The patient  was also tested at that time and found to be homozygous  for factor V Leiden mutation. What is the most appropri - ate recommendation regarding VTE prophylaxis for this  patient",E,"For pregnant women with no prior history of VTE who are homozygous either for factor V Leiden mutation or the prothrombin 20210A mutation and have a positive family history for VTE, antepartum prophylaxis with LMWH and postpartum prophylaxis for 6 weeks with LMWH or vitamin K antagonists for a target INR 2–3 is recommended. This patient has an increased risk of Coagulation 287 developing VTE, given her known thrombophilia, fam ily history of VTE, and pregnancy; thus no prophylaxis, antepartum prophylaxis only, or postpartum prophylaxis only is not appropriate."
"4), and aPTT is normal. The patient  has no history of bleeding diathesis; platelet count has  been 500,000 × 109/L. His only medications are hydrox - yurea and aspirin. Liver tests are normal.     Which is the best course of action at this point",A,"The PT assay is based on a standard measure of one part citrate:nine parts whole blood. In polycythemic patients with a hematocrit of more than 55%, there is less plasma volume per same volume of whole blood, which can lead to an increased PT due to over citrating the sample. As such, the lab should be alerted of the hematocrit and can adjust the amount of citrate within the tube to maintain the 1:9 ratio."
"A 56-year-old woman presents to the hematology clinic  after recently being found to have unprovoked bilateral  lower extremity DVTs. She requests an evaluation for oc - cult malignancy. Her clinical breast examination, mam - mography, screening colonoscopy, and PAP smears are  up to date. She has never smoked. She has no history of  prior VTE and no family history of VTE. She has no his - tory of malignancy in her family. A chest x-ray showed no  nodules or masses.     Regarding further cancer screening, which of the follow - ing is the best recommendation",D,"The SOME trial randomized patients with unpro voked VTE to undergo evaluation with limited can cer screening (routine screening for breast, cervical or prostate cancer) plus chest X ray with or without CT abdomen/pelvis. The overall incidence of develop ing a malignancy in this group was 3.9%, and there was no difference in cancer detection between the two screening strategies. Therefore it is NOT recommend ed to have CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for occult malignancy in the absence of symptoms. A prognosti cation strategy to identify those at highest risk of de veloping malignancy after unprovoked VTE is under investigation."
"A 54-year-old woman presents for guidance 1 week af - ter her first DVT of the proximal right leg provoked by  cholecystectomy. Her right leg swelling is improving  but has not resolved. She joined an online VTE support  group who recommended the use of elastic compression  stockings to prevent chronic postthrombotic syndrome.  She obtained over-the-knee stockings with 30–40 mm Hg  graded compression, but finds them unbearable.     Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation concerning prevention of postthrombotic syn - drome at this time",D,"In a large randomized controlled trial, compression stock ings did not prevent chronic postthrombotic syndrome. While they may help mitigate the symptoms of acute DVT (reduction in swelling/pain), their long term utility has not been proven."

About 20% of cases will not have the characteristically elevated blood counts at the time of splanchnic vein thrombosis; however, approximately 50% of those will develop overt MPN over time. Testing for the JAK2 V617F mutation from peripheral blood is reliable to detect underlying MPN. Bone marrow biopsy results can be negative in as many as 20% of cases where JAK2 mutations are detected and there exists heterogeneity in interpreting MPN bone marrow biopsies."

"A 50-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a pain - ful “cord” in her medial thigh. A lower extremity duplex  Doppler ultrasound shows a clot in the greater saphenous  vein, measuring 6 cm. She has no history of malignancy  and takes no medications. She has never had a prior ve - nous thromboembolism. She is otherwise healthy and  lives independently. Her renal and hepatic function are  normal.     Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation",C,"Superficial thrombophlebitis of greater than 5 cm in length or close to the junction of the deep venous system may benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation. The greater saphenous vein belongs to the superficial venous system. In patients with superficial venous throm bosis, a randomized controlled trial using fondaparinux 2.5 mg sq for 45 days resulted in symptomatic improve ment. The ACCP has recommended initiation of prophy lactic fondaparinux in the case of superficial vein throm bosis greater than 5 cm in length."
"A 54-year-old man is 15 days status post cholecystec - tomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. He undergoes  repeat chest CT scan ordered for follow-up of a pulmo - nary nodule noted 6 months previously. The CT identi - fies a possible left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary  embolism. The previously seen pulmonary nodule is no  longer present. He has felt well, without complaint of  dyspnea or leg pain. He has no prior history of throm - bosis. He is up to date on age and gender-appropriate  cancer screening. His kidney and hepatic function are  normal. D-dimer testing is normal (no elevation). Bi - lateral lower extremity Doppler ultrasound shows   no clot.     Which of the following is the best recommendation for  management of the incidentally noted subsegmental pul - monary embolism",A,"This male patient presents with an incidentally discov ered subsegmental pulmonary embolism 15 days after surgery. He has no prior history of thrombosis and no apparent risk factors for recurrence. His lower extremity Doppler ultrasound is negative, as is his D dimer. The ACCP 2016 guidelines suggest observation rather than treatment in such cases, given the questionable valid ity of the diagnosis of subsegmental PE and low risk of recurrence."
"6 g/dL Platelets 145,000 × 109/L      Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation",B,"In cases of catheter associated DVT where the catheter remains functional and necessary, the ISTH recommends leaving the catheter in place and administering anticoag ulation for at least 3 months and for as long as the catheter is in place."
A 48-year-old woman is admitted to the neurology ser - vice for management of a cerebral sinus thrombosis found  during evaluation of persistent headaches and papillede - ma. The CT scan shows a small associated intracerebral  hemorrhage.     Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation for management,B,It is thought that the etiology of cerebral hemorrhage associated with cerebral sinus thrombosis is elevated pressures from the thrombosis. Anticoagulation in this setting generally does not exacerbate hemorrhage. Sys temic thrombolysis in this setting has been associated with significant mortality and is not recommended. Antiplatelet agents have not been well studied in this condition.
"She has renal dysfunction, with es - timated creatinine clearance of 20 mL/min. Which of the  following do you recommend regarding management of  her anticoagulation",A,"This patient has significant renal dysfunction and obesity in the context of recurrent VTE necessitating long term anticoagulation. She has had a history of mildly suprath erapeutic INRs on warfarin. Her morbid obesity and low renal function make changing to LMWH, fondaparinux, or dabigatran unattractive options. Continuing warfarin is likely the safest option. Some studies suggest benefit from the addition of daily low dose vitamin K supplemen tation to patients who have fluctuating INRs secondary to inconsistent vitamin K intake."
"A 35-year-old man presents with acute left common  femoral vein thrombosis after leg swelling of 1 day’s  duration. He has no medical problems, takes no medi - cations, and denies prior surgery, trauma, or immo - bility. He is treated with warfarin after an enoxaparin  bridge and has had no trouble maintaining his INR  in the therapeutic range in the 3 months he has been  anticoagulated. He is referred for further manage - ment. There is no prior personal or family history of  thrombosis. He is a nonsmoker and nondrinker. He is   nonobese.     Which of the following is the most appropriate measure  at this time",C,"Men who have an unprovoked venous thromboembo lism have a 20% risk of recurrence, as compared with women, who have a 6% risk of recurrence, and it is therefore recommended that men who suffer an unpro voked VTE receive anticoagulation indefinitely. While a negative D dimer can predict those who are at lower risk for recurrence, the reduction in risk conferred by a negative D dimer is insufficient to recommend this course in men. The role of inherited thrombophilias in recurrent VTE is felt to be low, so a negative workup would not allow for discontinuation of anticoagulation. The presence of residual clot does increase the risk for recurrence, but a negative ultrasound does not protect against recurrence in a man."
"A 35-year-old man presents with acute left common  femoral vein thrombosis after leg swelling of 1 day’s  duration, 1 week after undergoing surgery on his left  ankle. He has no other medical problems and takes no  medications currently.

He is referred for further man - agement. There is no prior personal or family history of  thrombosis. He is a nonsmoker and nondrinker. He is  nonobese.     Which of the following is the most appropriate measure  at this time",E,"This patient has a venous thrombosis that is provoked by surgery, which is a transient risk factor. His risk for recur rent clot is low, and therefore 3 months of anticoagulation is sufficient. He does not need thrombophilia testing, D dimer testing, or repeat ultrasound.Coagulation 288"
19  is the most  likely set of results,C,"The factor V Leiden gene encodes a protein in which the arginine at positive 506 is changed to a glutamine, thus abolishing the major cleave/inactivation site for activated protein C. Factor V protein is made in the liver, but the genotypic testing is done on periph eral blood cells. After a liver transplantation, FVL genotypic testing will remain positive, since the bone marrow cells retain their original DNA. However, the factor V protein will now be wild type, since the new liver will be making normal factor V from the donor factor V gene."
A 55-year-old woman with a history of varicose veins is di - agnosed with a thrombosis in her right superficial femoral  vein following a vein stripping procedure on the left leg.     Which of the following is the most appropriate course of  action at this time,A,"The superficial femoral vein, despite is unfortunate name, is a part of the deep venous system of the leg. A clot in the SFV is therefore a deep venous thrombosis and must therefore be treated as a DVT, with at least 3 months of anticoagulation. Indefinite anticoagulation is not indi cated for a provoked DVT. A superficial venous clot does not necessitate full anticoagulation and might be with warm soaks and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents."
In which of the following patients would an IVC filter be  most indicated,D,"The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on antithrombotic therapy evaluated the appropriate indica tions for placement of IV filters. They recommend IVC filter placement for patients with PE or proximal DVT and contraindications to anticoagulation (such as recent intracranial surgery, as in the patient in D, but NOT a remote history of subdural hematoma, as in the patient in E). Patients who suffer recurrent thrombosis, despite therapeutic anticoagulation represent another group of patients in which IVC filter placement is recommended. In patients undergoing routine abdominal or pelvic sur gery, routine use of IVC filters is not recommended. Pa tients with large PE and residual clot are considered for IVC filter placement, but their routine use is not recom mended. BIBLIOGRAPHY"

How should he be managed",D,"Many patients suspected of having acute porphyria do not have the disease. Such patients frequently have un derlying psychiatric disorders. Patients with acute por phyria can experience neuropsychiatric findings during acute attacks. The hallmark laboratory feature of acute porphyria is elevation in the 24 hour urine PBG and ALA. Patients with acute porphyria have elevations in heme metabolites that are several orders of magnitude greater than normal. Trivial elevations in coproporphy rin, as seen in this patient, in the setting of a normal PBG is indicative of secondary coproporphyrinuria, which is not a porphyric state and does not require intervention."
0 mg/dL Fe 45 µg/dL TIBC 220 µg/dL Ferritin 565 ng/mL       How should he be managed,E,"The constellation of hemoglobin values in the 7–10 g/dL range with normal to low iron, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin is diagnostic of inflammatory anemia. Inflamma tory anemia is modulated by the small peptide hepcidin that is increased in the setting of inflammation. Hepcidin causes internalization and proteolysis of ferroportin, the membrane protein in the enterocyte and macrophage that allows for iron release. Patients with inflammatory anemia do not require specific therapy. A ferritin of 565 is incompatible with iron deficiency and supplemental iron should be avoided. Although supplemental erythropoi etin may increase the hemoglobin in inflammatory states, it is seldom necessary, especially not in asymptomatic pa tients."
3 mg/dL Smear Decreased platelets. Rare schistocytes       What is the most likely diagnosis,A,"The bite of the brown recluse spider (loxoscelism) con tains sphingomyelinase D that causes local necrosis at the site of envenomation and hemolytic anemia. Occasion ally, the bite is accompanied by DIC. Patients bitten by a brown recluse spider can also have renal injury. There is no antivenom available, and the treatment is supportive. MRSA and lyme do not cause hemolysis. Rhus dermatitis is related to contact with poison ivy, oak, or sumac. Pyo derma gangrenosum can result from a number of under lying disorders but is not associated with hemolysis."
2 mg/dL Smear 3–5 schistocytes per HPF       What is the most likely diagnosis,C,"The peripheral smear is often more sensitive than cardiac ECHO in detecting small paravalvular leaks and valve hemolysis. Similarly, the presence of an audible murmur is not a reproducible finding in small paravalvular abnor malities. The constellation of hemolytic anemia and schis tocytes in the setting of an artificial valve should alert the clinician to this possibility. Surgery is the treatment of choice for significant valvular hemolysis. The patient has no signs or symptoms suggesting TTP or DIC. Schisto cytes are not present in cold agglutinin disease or warm antibody hemolysis."

Hgb EP 98% Hgb A, 2% Hgb A2 G6PD Normal PBS Normal       What is the most likely diagnosis",A,"G6PD deficiency is found in Mediterraneans and Af ricans. About 10% of American Americans have mild G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency is X linked so occurs predominantly in male patients. The patient in question likely developed oxidative hemolysis in response to anti biotic therapy. In African Americans the G6PD variant is unstable, and thus levels fall in older cells but are normal in younger red cells. Measuring G6PD levels in African Americans in the setting of acute hemolysis often produc es normal levels as the enzyme deficient older cells are already destroyed. As such, G6PD levels are best checked after an acute hemolytic episode. PNH is excluded in this patient by the flow cytometry studies. Although bite cells can be seen in G6PD deficiency, this is not a universal finding. Normal Coomb’s test excludes other immune causes of hemolysis."

What is the most likely diagnosis",B,"Serous atrophy of the marrow, also known as gelatinous transformation, occurs in severely malnourished individu als. It has been reported in patients with anorexia, bulimia, HIV , and malignancy induced cachexia. In the setting of severe malnutrition, the marrow accumulates hyaluronic acid and undergoes fat atrophy and gelatinous transforma tion. Although the marrow is technically aplastic, the accu mulation of hyaluronic acid and the absence of fat exclude aplastic anemia. Similarly, the patient described did not have fibrosis, tumor, or dysplastic features in the marrow."

This may be due to metformin’s effects on Ca2+ dependent membrane action where cobalamin/intrinsic factor absorption is Ca2+ dependent at the ileal membrane surface. In one study, 7.2% more patients taking metform in had cobalamin deficiency compared with age matched controls. Metformin induced cobalamin deficiency can be accompanied by the same neuropsychological findings as other cobalamin deficient states. It can be corrected by supplementing with calcium carbonate 1.2 g daily. The Schilling test is seldom performed as it involves the use of radioactivity and this test, like antibody testing, would not lead to a correct diagnosis."

The best test to make the diagnosis is an analysis for E5MI binding that carries a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.98. In contrast, osmotic fragility carries a sensitivity of 0.68 and specific ity of 0."
2 g/dL Hct 24% MCV 62 fL Ferritin 11 ng/mL       Which of the following over-the-counter products is most  likely causing her findings,E,"Copper is needed to convert ferric iron to ferrous iron. Zinc competes with copper for absorption. As such, cop per deficiency and zinc excess can both lead to iron defi ciency that is resistant to supplemental iron supplementa tion. Zinc is a common element in over the counter cold medications. The other mentioned supplements are not associated with iron deficiency."
7 mg/dL Iron 150 µg/dL Ferritin 652 ng/mL TIBC 270 µg/dL       What other hormone should be checked in evaluation of  his persistent anemia,B,"Hyperparathyroidism can lead to marrow fibrosis and can also lead to decreased erythropoietin synthesis. Ad ditionally, erythroid colonies show suppressed growth in response to the parathyroid hormone, and red cells have shortened survival in the setting of hyperparathyroidism. For all of these reasons, patients who are on dialysis who are not responding to erythropoietin should be checked for elevations in PTH. The treatment for these patients is parathyroidectomy that can restore the hematocrit. Inter estingly, calcitriol does not appear to improve erythro poiesis in patients with elevated PTH levels.Hematopoietic System Disorders 331"
"7 g/dL Hct 35% MCV 90 fL WBC 6200/mm3 Platelet 354,000/mm3       Which test should be ordered to assess hemoglobin oxy - gen affinity",B,"Patients with low oxygen affinity hemoglobin have a physiologic anemia due to increased oxygen delivery by the abnormal hemoglobin. In contrast, patients with a high O 2 affinity hemoglobin present with erythrocyto sis. The p50 represents the partial pressure of oxygen at 50% hemoglobin saturation. This normally occurs a 26.6 mm Hg. Patients with low oxygen affinity hemoglobin will have a high p50 due to increased oxygen release by the abnormal hemoglobin. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is abnormal in a very small percentage of such patients who have mutations in the oxygen binding region of hemoglobin. Pulse oximetry is often not sensitive nor spe cific in the diagnosis of altered O 2 affinity hemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin is useful in the detection of carbon monoxide exposure. E5MI is useful in the diagnosis of spherocytosis."

N 2O oxidizes B12 cobalt from the monovalent to trivalent state rendering methylcobalamin inactive. In this setting, acute neurological effects and delirium can be seen. Treatment is immediate initiation of B12 and folate, which often produce dramatic resolutions of symptoms and improve hematopoiesis within hours."
0 g/dL Hct 30% MCV 65 fL RBC count 5900 × 109/L       What is the most likely diagnosis,B,"The Mentzer index can be useful in differentiating beta thalassemia from iron deficiency. The Mentzer index is the ratio between the MCV (in fL) and the red blood cell count (in 1012 cells/L). A value of less than 13 is sugges tive of iron deficiency, whereas a value of greater than 13 is more likely iron deficiency. This is the case because in iron deficiency, the erythrocyte count is decreased, whereas in thalassemia, the red cells are small but pro duced in sufficient or even increased quantity. In hgb SC disease, the erythrocyte count is decreased. Sideroblastic anemia is associated with decreased erythrocytes, as is lead poisoning."
2 mg/dL Peripheral smear Clumped red cells throughout slide       How is his anemia best managed,E,"The patient described has cold agglutinin disease as evi denced by his laboratory studies and peripheral smear, which shows agglutinated red cells in a slide performed at room temperature. Cold agglutinin disease develops when IgM antibodies bind red cells and cause complement mediated hemolysis and destruction in the liver. Cold ag glutinin disease is treated by keeping the patient and infu sates at body temperature and rituximab administration is considered front line therapy. Glucocorticoids are typically ineffective, and hemolysis occurs in the liver rendering splenectomy of limited utility. Plasmapheresis and IVIg similarly have not been shown to be particularly effective."
5 ng/mL       Which iron preparation has the highest rate of anaphy - laxis,D,"Ferric, iron sucrose, and ferumoxytol all are generally well tolerated. Ferrous sulfate is frequently not absorbed well in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and typically worsens symptoms, but only rarely causes allergic reac tions. Iron dextran may be given as a single dose infusion but has a higher complication rate, especially anaphylaxis."
"2% Absolute reticulocyte count 400,000 × 109/L Coombs Negative       Which of the following tests would be most helpful in   establishing a diagnosis",C,"The patient described has paroxysmal cold hemoglo binuria, an immune hemolysis that is associated with syphilis and results from complement mediated he molysis with antibody to the P antigen on red cells. The antibody attaches at colder temperatures, but fixes com plement in warmer areas of the body. Diagnosis requires analysis for the presence of the Donath Landsteiner antibody. This requires collecting and maintaining a pa tient blood sample at body temperature. Patient serum is mixed with P antigen positive type O RBC and donor serum. The sample is chilled to 32°F and then warmed. The tube is centrifuged and supernatant assessed for hemolysis. E5MA is used to detect spherocytes in hereditary spherocytosis. PK levels are useful in patients suspect of having PK deficiency. Such patient would present in infancy with Coombs negative hemolysis. ANA and sucrose hemolysis would not be useful."
"A 6-month-old boy was brought to the emergency room  several hours after his mother noticed cyanosis and a blue  tint on his mucous membranes. The patient was the prod - uct of normal gestation and delivery and weighed 3350 g.  He was noted to have diaper rash on exam, in addition to  having cyanotic skin and mucous membranes. His oxygen  saturation on pulse oximetry was 97%. His mother had  been treating his diaper rash with benzocaine and resor - cinol cream.       How should he be managed",C,"The patient described has methemoglobinemia, a condi tion caused by excessive ferric (Fe3+) rather than ferrous (Fe2+) hemoglobin in the blood. In this case, the use of ben zocaine cream lead to the disorder. Ferric hemoglobin has a decreased ability to bind oxygen and leads to decrease release of oxygen by the other three ferrous heme sites on the hemoglobin molecule. Patients with acquired methe moglobinemia respond rapidly to intravenous methylene blue that provides an artificial electron receptor for NA DPH methemoglobin reductase. Vitamin C may also be used. The other treatments listed in the question would not provide such an electron receptor and would not re verse methemoglobinemia."

Patients who coinherit Hgb E with beta0 thalassemia have a variable phenotype ranging from lack of symptoms to transfusion dependence. The patient in question has a moderate anemia. His electrophoretic pat tern is classic for Hgb E/beta0 thalassemia with over 50% Hgb E and the remainder being Hgb F. The etiology of ele vated Hgb F in this condition is obscure but may be related to mutations in the gamma promoter region of chromo some 11. The other hemoglobinopathies listed in the ques tion would have very low percentages of Hgb F.

Such patients respond to the C5 antibody, eculizumab that is FDA approved for this indication. The patient does not have TTP due to normal ADAMTS13 levels and the absence of and ADAMTS13 inhibitor. As such, treatment for TTP including plasmapheresis, rituximab, and ster oids would not be appropriate. Similarly, IVIg, sometimes useful in the treatment of ITP , would not be the appropri ate management."

How should she be managed,B,"Patients homozygous for the H63D mutation in the HFE gene seldom have problems with iron overload despite increases in transferrin saturation and mild increases in ferritin. Additionally, premenopausal women have fewer problems with iron overload due to regular iron losses. In contrast, patients who are homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation or compound heterozygotes for C282Y/ H63D are more likely to suffer end organ complications of iron overload. Phlebotomy is generally reserved for these patients to maintain a ferritin of less than 50 ng/mL. Hematopoietic System Disorders 332 Liver biopsy and MRI are commonly used methods to detect the amount of iron overload in such patients but would not be appropriate for the patient in question due to her mutational status. Oral iron chelators are indicated for patients with thalassemia or transfusional iron over load as such patients cannot typically tolerate phleboto my due to baseline anemia."

Re - view of his peripheral smear reveals acanthocytes.       Which of the following antigens is most likely absent on  his red cells",D,"The McLeod phenotype is characterized by the absence of the Kell antigen on red cells and is one of the neu roacanthocytosis syndromes. The others include chorea acanthocytosis, Huntington disease like 2, and panto thenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration. In all of these, patients present as the patient in question with progressive neurologic deterioration. Degeneration of the basal ganglia is a key finding. These are X linked conditions. The red cell abnormalities are thought to arise from alterations in the red cell membrane due to abnormal phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins."
5 mIU/mL       What test should be ordered next,D,"The patient described has a secondary erythrocytosis based on a “normal” erythropoietin level in the setting of a markedly elevated hemoglobin level. Absence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation makes a myeloproliferative disor der unlikely and in the setting of an erythropoietin level that is not suppressed rules out polycythemia vera. One important secondary cause of erythrocytosis is an under lying neoplasm. Hepatocellular carcinoma and kidney cancer are two such neoplasms that would be revealed on abdominal imaging. Red cell mass would be expected to be increased in any individual with a Hgb of 19.6 and is currently a very difficult to test to obtain. Red cell sur vival would not be useful, and with a low likelihood of a myeloproliferative disorder a bone marrow biopsy would not be helpful.

5 µg/L       Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis,C,"The TMPRSS6 gene encodes the protein matriptase 2 that is able to bind and degrade hemojuvelin that is needed to promote hepcidin production. Hepcidin causes inter nalization of the membrane protein ferroportin, which al lows for iron absorption in the gut and iron release from macrophages. As a result of dysfunctional matriptase 2, patients with mutations in TMPRSS6 have very high hep cidin levels and, as a result, are unable to absorb oral iron. Mutations in TMPRSS6 are responsible for the majority of iron refractory iron deficient anemia. Patients with ferro portin disease of hemojuvelin mutations have hereditary hemochromatosis due to very low hepcidin levels. The porphyric states are not associated with iron deficiency refractory to iron therapy."

Which of the following is most likely responsible for his  physical exam findings",A,"The physical exam described is classic for pulmonary hypertension. A loud P2, right sided S3 (louder with in spiration) and peripheral edema are all found in patients with elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Patients with sickle cell disease develop pulmonary hypertension at alarming frequency due to both decreased NO levels and decreased arginine, a substrate for NO. The treatment for this disorder is unclear and the prognosis poor. Acute chest syndrome presents as a constellation of fever, chest pain, hypoxia, and pulmonary infiltrate. Cardiomyopa thy would most likely present as S3 heard with both in spiration and expiration. ASD is associated with a fixed split S2. High output heart failure may produce a systolic flow murmur but would not produce the cardiac findings in the case."

Chronic liver disease is thought to impair the liver’s ability to esterify cho lesterol causing free cholesterol to bind to the red cell membrane increasing its surface area and causing bizarre projections. The resulting cells are spur cells or acantho cytes. Microcytes would be expected in iron deficiency or thalassemia, and most patients with liver disease have some degree of macrocytosis. Echinocytes, or burr cells, are found in renal disease. Drepanocytes are sickled cells and dacryocytes are teardrop cells found in myelofibrosis and other marrow abnormalities."
"2 µg/L       Assuming a target hemoglobin of 12, what is her intrave - nous iron requirement",C,"In evaluating an iron deficient patient for intravenous re placement, it is important to be able to estimate the iron requirement. To calculate replacement doses of iron, it is important to remember that 1 mL of blood contains about 1 mg of iron. Further, total blood volume is 65 mL/kg and hemoglobin contains about 0.34% iron by weight. There fore: Iron deficit (g) = (target Hb actual Hb[g/dL])/100 × weight (kg) × 65 × 0.0034 Iron deficit (mg) = (target Hb actual Hb) × weight (kg) × 2.2 Iron deficit (mg) = (target Hb actual Hb) × weight (pounds) This represents the amount of iron needed to make up the extra RBC mass. To this amount, storage iron must be added, which is about 600 mg for women and 1000 mg for men. For the above patient, this represents: (12−7.2) × 110 + 600 = 1128 or about 1100 mg. If this patient were replaced with oral iron (and if she could absorb oral iron), she would need much more since only about 5%–10% of oral iron is absorbed."

PNH should be suspected based on its known association with AA and MDS as well as he patic vein occlusion. Flow cytometry FLAER testing is the most specific and sensitive test to make the diagnosis of PNH. Factor V Leiden would not explain pancytopenia and is only rarely associated with hepatic vein occlusion. Cytogenetics are typically normal in PNH.

A high suspicion for the diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda should be entertained. Many patients with the genetic mutations leading to PCT only become symptomatic when exposed to excessive iron through as can occur with infection with hepatitis C. In fact, patients with hepatitis C have a 66% higher likelihood of developing PCT. This patient should have liver function and hepatitis serolo gies sent. Patients with AIP do not have skin lesions, and therefore testing for urine AIP and PBG is not necessary. HFE mutations are less likely in the absence of family his tory and with a transferrin saturation of less than 50%. A liver MRI for iron content would also not be helpful."

What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s hemolytic  anemia",C,"Passenger lymphocytes in transplanted organs can cause hemolysis several days following transplant. This is typi cally due to antibodies against ABO antigens, but can oc cur with mismatch of other red blood cell antigens. In the case described, the recipient was type A and received a transplant from a type O donor. The donor lymphocytes expressed anti A, which reacted against the recipient type A blood cells. Typically, hemolysis due to passenger lymphocytes is short lived and does not require specific treatment. Transfusion should be with type O positive red cells. In contrast, major ABO mismatch causes life threatening hemolysis and shock. An ABO mismatch causes symptoms immediately during the transfusion. In the case described, the patient remained asymptomatic, which is not indicative of an ABO mismatch. Tacrolimus, and other calcineurin inhibitors, can cause microangio pathic hemolysis. EBV infections can cause cold agglu tinin disease or warm antibody mediated hemolysis. In neither of these two cases, would anti A antibodies be present."

This is caused by excessive copper accumulated due to a mutation in ATP7B, which leads to low cerulo plasmin levels and copper accumulation in the brain and liver. Copper also accumulates in the red cell membrane and may damage the cell membrane and inactivate en zymes of the pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways. Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with spherocytosis can be the presenting feature of Wilson disease. Neuro logic disease can also be present. Copper chelation with penicillamine can reverse the hemolytic process. The other treatments mentioned (glucocorticoids, IVIg, plas mapheresis, rituximab) may be effective for some types of immune hemolysis, but would not be useful in a patient with Wilson disease."

Over 80% of patients with RARS have a mutation in the ribosomal SF3B1 gene that strongly correlates with the presence of ringed si deroblasts in the marrow. The presence of an additional JAK2 mutation produces thrombocytosis in some patients as in the one described. This myelodysplastic disorder has a low likelihood of leukemic progression.

In contrast, only homocysteine is elevated in folate deficiency. Subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with subtle signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, as in this case, can be detected by identification of elevated methylmalonic acid levels. This is particularly true for patients whose vitamin B12 levels are in the “low normal” range. Additionally, pancytopenia can occur in vitamin B12 deficient patients. Malabsorption, independent of pernicious anemia, is the most likely cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in an older patient. Although bone marrow biopsy can be sugges tive of vitamin B12 deficiency, it is not a specific test for confirming this disorder because there are other potential causes of megaloblastic marrow, including myelodyspla sia. Erythrocyte folate levels have been touted as a bet ter indication of folate stores than are serum folate levels, but are subject to problems of defining normal values and may not be that helpful clinically. Erythrocyte folate lev els can also be depressed in patients with vitamin B12 de ficiency. Additionally, folate deficiency would not cause the neurologic symptoms present in this patient. Parietal cell or intrinsic factor antibodies are elevated in patients with pernicious anemia, but may not be elevated in patients whose vitamin B12 deficiency is due to malab sorption."

2% Absolute reticulocyte 3400/µL       Which of the following is his most likely diagnosis,C,"Patients with hemolytic anemia, such as that in sickle cell disease, have an increased requirement for folate because of excessive cell turnover. This is also true for patients with desquamative skin disorders. In this case, the pa tient probably has not been taking supplemental folate, perhaps due to an oversight or difficulties with medical adherence in the setting of a previous stroke. The diagno sis can be confirmed with a serum folate measurement. The appropriate treatment for patients with folate defi ciency is oral folic acid, 1–5 mg daily, for a duration of 1 to 4 months or until the patient achieves complete hemato logic recovery. Following repletion, maintenance therapy with folate should continue indefinitely with 1 mg/day. Folate deficiency does not confer the risk for neurologic Hematopoietic System Disorders 334 sequelae but is associated with anemia characterized by an elevated MCV as is demonstrated in this patient. Im portantly, patients taking hydroxyurea may also have an elevated MCV that can confuse the diagnosis. Hyperhemolysis in sickle cell disease is characterized by an increased reticulocyte count, which is not present in this patient. Anemia of chronic disease is typified by a normal or decreased MCV , not an increased MCV as found in this case. Similarly, patients with iron deficiency have a low MCV . Patients can have coexisting cobalamin deficiency with sickle cell disease, although this is not as likely a diagnosis as folate deficiency since cobalamin deficiency takes years to develop and hemolysis leads to increased folate requirements. Additionally, cobalamin deficiency that causes anemia may also be associated with loss of vibratory sense, which was absent in this patient’s neurologic examination findings. However, the anemia of cobalamin deficiency can be reversed with folate therapy, necessitating establishment of a firm diagnosis before folate therapy is begun."

In addition to aspirin, which of the following is the  most appropriate secondary prevention of stroke in this   patient",D,"The pathophysiology of stroke in patients with sickle cell disease is complex, involving adherent erythrocyte membranes, constricted arterioles, nitric oxide deple tion, and other factors. Strokes recur in up to 70% of pa tients with sickle cell disease following an initial stroke, if left untreated. Randomized trials have confirmed the ability of monthly erythrocyte transfusions (hypertrans fusions) of 2 units per month to decrease stroke recur rence by 50% in patients with sickle cell disease. In fact, in children at risk for stroke based on abnormal cranial Doppler flow measurements, such hypertransfusion therapy is an effective prophylactic treatment. Further more, increased stroke risk returns to baseline in chil dren in whom transfusions are stopped once initiated. Dipyridamole, clopidogrel, statins, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have a role in stroke pre vention in patients with atherosclerotic disease; howev er, their role in patients with sickle cell disease remains undefined.

5 g/dL. Erythro - cyte indices are normal. Serum ferritin concentration is  125 ng/mL.       Which of the following is the most likely cause of this pa - tient’s anemia,A,"Normal pregnancy is associated with mild anemia consist ing of hemoglobin concentrations during the first and third trimesters of greater than 11.0 g/dL. Normal hemoglobin concentrations during the second trimester are greater than 10.5 g/dL. Anemia is physiological in pregnancy and related to an expansion of both plasma volume and eryth rocyte mass. Because plasma volume expands to a greater extent than erythrocyte mass, the hemoglobin concentra tion decreases. Expansion of both erythrocyte mass and plasma volume results in effective delivery of oxygen to the developing fetus in a lower viscosity, high oxygen car rying capacity state. Plasma volume expands greatest dur ing the second trimester. Erythropoietin levels reach 150% of prepregnancy levels at delivery. Alterations in hepcidin have not been described in pregnant patients, but as hep cidin decreases iron absorption, elevated hepcidin levels produce iron deficiency over time. The patient described has normal iron levels inconsistent with increased hepci din levels. The developing fetus needs folate and, as such, folate requirements increase in pregnancy."

This patient has a moderate microcytic anemia with an extra band found on hemoglobin electrophoresis. This extra band corresponds to hemoglobin H, which is com posed of polymerized β chains, which migrate faster than hemoglobin A on a starch gel. The peripheral blood smear in this case shows target cells and microcytic in dices, which are characteristic findings in patients with a three α gene defect responsible for hemoglobin H dis ease. There is a spectrum of disease severity in Hgb H, ranging from moderate anemia to more severe anemia with transfusion dependence, heart failure, and prema ture mortality. This mutation is more common in South east Asians. The history of thalassemia in both parents was responsible for this patient’s genotype. Patients with a single gene abnormality [(−−/ α), (α/α)] are silent carriers of α thalassemia and have normal hematologic indices and hemoglobin electrophoresis results. A two gene defect in cis or trans produces α thalassemia trait, which is characterized by a mild microcytic anemia with a preserved or increased erythrocyte count and normal hemoglobin electrophoresis results. Hydrops fetalis is not compatible with life and results from complete dele tion of all alpha genes."
Hepcidin is known to be one of the major regulators of iron  absorption.     In which of the following conditions would hepcidin lev - els be expected to be elevated,E,"Hepcidin, a small peptide with antimicrobial properties, has been proven to be the major negative regulator of iron absorption. Hepcidin is produced by the liver and inhibits the intestinal absorption, macrophage release, and placental passage of iron. Hepcidin levels typically rise with infection and inflammation (states where the body’s response is to conserve iron), and thus levels would be high (although possibly inappropriately) in the anemia of chronic disease (answer E) and fall with hypoxia or iron deficiency anemia (answers A and C). In hereditary hemochromatosis, interactions with the mutated HFE gene, lead to decreased hepcidin levels and therefore chronically increased iron absorption (an swer B). B12 deficiency does not affect iron absorption, and thus hepcidin levels should not be significantly altered (answer D)."

In Caucasians, the most com mon genotype is homozygous C282Y; however, clinical expression is low, and over 50% of individuals do not de velop clinical signs of the disease. HFE mutation testing is thus the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. T2* MRI of the liver and liver biopsy would aid in quantification of iron overload in the liver, but would not be the initial step in the evaluation, and might not be necessary unless ferritin is greater than 1000 ng/mL or liver function tests were abnormal. Laboratory testing for hepcidin levels is not routinely available and although expected to be de creased in HFE hemochromatosis would not be sufficient to make the diagnosis. Thyroid studies also would not aid in making a diagnosis.Hematopoietic System Disorders 335"

Patients with HFE (type 1) related hemochromatosis rarely present before the fourth decade (answers A and B). Other genetically driven diseases of iron overload are becoming increasingly rec ognized. Juvenile hemochromatosis (type 2) typically pre sents at a young age with severe signs of iron overload in cluding heart failure and polyendocrinopathies, while liver dysfunction may be less pronounced. Juvenile hemochro matosis is due to a recessive loss of function mutation in the hemojuvelin (HJV) or hepcidin genes (answer D). Type 3 hemochromatosis is typically due to a mutation in the transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) gene, and its clinical presen tation may mimic HFE related disease, although patients are usually younger and iron overload may be more severe (answer C). Type 4 hemochromatosis is due to mutations in the ferroportin gene. Overall, the clinical manifestations are limited, and in the type 4A variant, transferrin satura tion is low (answer E).

Which of the following laboratory tests should be per - formed initially to confirm your diagnostic suspicion",A,"AIP , variegate porphyria, and coprophyria are consid ered acute neurovisceral porphyrias. Acute intermittent porphyria, the most common form, is caused by a defi ciency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase/hy droxymethylbilane synthase needed for heme biosynthe sis. Deficiency of the enzyme results in overproduction of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen. Clinical criteria include paroxysmal neurovisceral symptoms, such as abdominal pain, autonomic dysfunction, acute peripheral neuropathy, muscle weakness, hyponatremia, and psychiatric symptoms. Patients may also experience seizures. Rapid screening in the ER includes spot urine for PBG, ALA, and total porphyrins. Urine PBG will be markedly elevated in the acute setting in all the acute porphyrias and would be the initial diagnostic test of answer. Erythrocyte PBG deaminase determination can confirm deficiency of the enzyme, but many asymp tomatic carriers exist and evidence of accumulation of porphyrin precursors would be required. Additionally, some patients express the mutated PBG deaminase only in the liver and not in peripheral blood, so testing can be falsely normal. Erythrocyte delta ALAD is decreased in ALA dehydratase porphyria. High levels of urine uropor phyrins are found in PCT. Once the diagnosis of an acute porphyria is made by elevated urine PBG, further studies including coproporphyrins can be evaluated to delineate between the types."

Both B12 and folate deficiency result in macrocytic anemia and pancytopenia; however, neurologic deficits do not occur in folate deficiency. Ane mia of renal disease typically results in a normocytic, normochromic anemia. Aplastic anemia typically causes pancytopenia but would not typically cause neuropathy. Iron deficiency anemia is typically microcytic."
"8 g/dL Hematocrit 30% MCV 151 fL Platelet count 165,000/µL Leucocyte count 4761/µL       A blood smear is being prepared for review.       Which of the following tests is most likely to lead to the  correct diagnosis",E,"The patient presented in this vignette had a very high MCV , which is most likely to be a laboratory artifact. In addition, he had recently developed weight loss, fevers, night sweats, and peripheral cyanosis is noted on physi cal examination. This is highly suggestive of cold agglu tinin disease, and the very high MCV is due to aggluti nation of RBCs as blood cools during testing. Review of the blood smear would show agglutination of RBCs that would likely abate with warming of the sample. A direct Coombs test should be sent and would be expected to be positive for complement and negative for IgG (answer E). The clinical scenario and markedly elevated MCV would be unusual for other causes of macrocytic anemia includ ing chronic ETOH, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficien cy, or hypothyroidism (answers A–D)."
2 .       What test would most likely identify the cause for the   severe anemia,B,"This patient has a severe acquired hypoproliferative ane mia. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is characterized by severe anemia, lack of reticulocytes, and an absence of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. PRCA may be idiopathic or develop secondary to other diagnoses. The findings on the peripheral blood smear in this case demonstrate lympho cytes with prominent basophilic granules, which is highly suggestive of large granular lymphocytosis (LGL). LGL can be diagnosed by flow cytometry and T cell receptor gene rearrangement studies (answer B). The great majority of T cell LGL express CD3, CD8, CD16, CD57, and have a rearrangement of the alpha/beta TCR, but do not usually express CD4 and CD"
3 .       Which of the following treatments would be most success - ful in treatment of his worsening anemia,E,"The patient presented in this vignette has end stage liv er disease and worsening anemia. The peripheral blood smear shows an abundance of spur cells. The presence of spur cell anemia (Zieve syndrome) portends a very poor prognosis. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment when spur cell anemia is associated with ESLD (answer E). This syndrome may also be seen with acute ETOH and may be reversible with cessation. Answers A–D are all potential treatments for autoimmune hemo lytic anemia, but the finding of acanthocytosis makes this diagnosis much less likely."
4 .       Which of the following treatments would is most appro - priate for initial therapy,C,"The sideroblastic anemias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by anemia (micro/normo/ macrocytic) with ring sideroblasts (as shown) on Prus sian blue staining, representing iron accumulation in the mitochondria. Both hereditary and acquired forms exist and differentiation is important as treatments dif fer. The classic X linked inherited sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) occurs in males and is due to a mutation in the erythroid specific 5 aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2) gene. As opposed to the acquired sideroblastic anemias, XSLA is very responsive to oral vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) at doses of 50–100 mg daily (answer C). Bone marrow transplantation or azacytidine may be indicated in the myelodysplastic syndrome variants with ring sidero blasts (answers A and E). Iron unloading would be rea sonable, but his symptomatic anemia likely precludes therapeutic phlebotomy (answer B). Zinc excess can lead to copper deficiency, which is a cause of acquired sidero blastic anemia (answer D)."
5 ):       Which of the following is the most appropriate manage - ment at this time,D,"The patient presented in this vignette had multiple physi cal findings consistent with the diagnosis of anorexia ner vosa including low body weight, poor dentition, dry skin, brittle hair, and puffy cheeks (due to parotid inflamma tion). Isolated cytopenias as well as pancytopenia have been well described in patients with anorexia nervosa. In advanced stages of anorexia, bone marrow atrophy with Hematopoietic System Disorders 337 a gelatinous appearance on biopsy can be seen. The pa tient in this vignette should be referred to psychiatry for definitive diagnosis and treatment (answer D). At the cur rent levels of hemoglobin and platelet count, PRBC and platelet transfusion are not indicated (answers A and B). Although the ANC is 781/ μL, there is no obvious infec tion, making G CSF unwarranted (answer C). Bone mar row transplant referral is not needed at this point as the pancytopenia is less likely to be due to a primary bone marrow disorder and would be expected to improve with improved nutrition (answer E)."
8 mg/dL Vitamin B12 756 pg/mL       What test would most likely identify the cause of the anemia,A,"The patient in this vignette has an acquired hypoprolif erative macrocytic anemia. Her symptoms of cold intol erance, fatigue, and constipation are classic for hypothy roidism, as is bradycardia and dry skin. Hypothyroidism should be considered in any evaluation of macrocytic anemia, and in this case thyroid function studies will like ly be diagnostic (answer A). Folate deficiency is quite un common in the western world where foods are fortified with folic acid. In addition, this patient eats a balanced diet and has no other risk factors for folate deficiency (an swer B). A primary bone marrow disorder should be in the differential of an unexplained macrocytic anemia, and bone marrow biopsy should be considered if laboratory evaluation is unrevealing. In this case, however, hypo thyroidism is much more likely and should be evaluated first (answer C). B12 level is well within the normal range and methylmalonic acid level is unlikely to identify sub clinical B12 deficiency (answer D). Coombs test would not likely identify the cause of anemia as the reticulocyte count is low and LDH and bilirubin are normal, making hemolysis much less likely (answer E)."
8 mg/dL Vitamin B12 756 pg/mL Folic acid Normal       Peripheral blood smear shows tear drop cells and nucleated  red blood cells. No early myeloid cells are appreciated.       Which of the following is the next best step in the evalua - tion of this patient,D,"Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in late stage HIV , affecting up to 80% of patients. In many cases, the etiology of the anemia is multifactorial. Malig nancy, infection (fungal, viral, mycobacterial), autoim mune hemolytic anemia, and thrombotic microangiopa thies should all be considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient in this vignette has advanced HIV with a low CD4 count. She has systemic symptoms of weight loss and fever. Nucleated red blood cells and teardrop shaped red blood cells are noted on review of the peripheral blood smear. Assessment of the bone marrow looking for fungal infection, mycobacterial infection, or hematologic malignancy is warranted (answer D). There is no evidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with a low re ticulocyte count, normal platelet count, LDH, and blood smear without schistocytes, and therefore ADAMTS 13 testing is not warranted (answer A). As there is no evi dence of hemolysis osmotic fragility, Coombs test and G 6 PD testing would not currently be indicated (answers B, C, and E)."
You are preparing a lecture for your medical school’s sec - ond year hematology course on human hemoglobin struc - ture and function.     Which of the following would be accurate information to  include in your lecture,C,"The structure and function of hemoglobin is essential for human life. Fetal hemoglobin has substantially higher oxygen affinity then does adult hemoglobin, allowing the transport of oxygen across the placenta and to the fetus (answer C). A shift of the hemoglobin oxygen desatura tion curve to the left, as seen with decreased levels of 2.3 BPG leads to increased binding of oxygen (answer A). At birth fetal hemoglobin still represents 60% of total hemo globin, decreasing to 1% in the adult (answer B). Hb A2 (α2δ2) is elevated in beta thalassemia, not alpha thalas semia (answer D). Two copies of the alpha globin gene and only one copy of the beta globin chain exist on their respective chromosomes (answer E)."
2 million) RDW Normal       Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis,C,"Patients with alpha thalassemia trait (two alpha gene deletion) exhibit mild microcytic, hypochromic anemia. The hemoglobin electrophoresis is usually normal, and this is often a diagnosis of exclusion. Individuals with one gene deletion usually have a normal hemoglobin and are not microcytic. In iron deficiency anemia the RDW is typically elevated, and the RBC count would be expected to be decreased. Beta thalassemia major results in more severe anemia and clinical sequelae of ineffective erythropoiesis. The anemia of chronic inflammation is typically normocytic or mildly micro cytic and would also be expected to have a decreased RBC count."
Hematopoietic System Disorders 308       Peripheral blood smear shows target cells and microcytic  red blood cells with occasional inclusion bodies. Hemoglobin electrophoresis results: Hb A 75% and 22%  of a band to be determined.       What is the most likely diagnosis,C,"The patient in this vignette has moderate microcytic symptomatic anemia, occasionally requiring transfusion. Both parents have a milder form of anemia. Of the an swers listed Hb H disease ( α / ) is the best option (an swer C). The clinical manifestations of Hb H disease are more severe than alpha and beta thalassemia minor, which usually present with mild asymptomatic micro cytic anemia (answers B and D). The clinical course is less severe than in hydrops fetalis, which presents in utero or at birth with severe life threatening anemia and is usually fatal. In hydrops fetalis, no hemoglobin A, F, or A2 can be made given the lack of production of any alpha chain (answer E). Beta thalassemia major/Cooley anemia also presents with a more severe course. Typically life long transfusions are required, growth retardation is noted, and hepatosplenomegaly is appreciated, along with other sequela beginning after around 6 months of life when gamma chain production is significantly decreased (an swer A)."
9%        Peripheral blood smear shows target cells and microcytic  red blood cells. Hemoglobin electrophoresis reveals: Hb A 91% Hb A2 6% Hb F 3%       What is the most likely diagnosis,D,"The patient in this vignette has a mild microcytic ane mia and target cells on the peripheral blood smear, which could be consistent with either alpha thalassemia minor or beta thalassemia minor. Her Mediterra nean heritage is classic for beta thalassemia, and the elevated A2 band ( α2δ2) is diagnostic (answer D). Beta thalassemia major (Cooley anemia) is a severe life threatening transfusion dependent anemia (answer A). Alpha thalassemia trait does not lead to microcytic red blood cells or anemia (answer B). An elevated A2 band would not be seen in alpha thalassemia minor (answer C). In hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin Hb F would be much higher and Hb A2 would not be elevated (answer E)."
8 mg/dL Ferritin 668 ng/mL Type and screen O+ with no alloantibodies CXR No infiltrates Urinalysis Negative      Which of the following would you recommend at this  time,B,"The care of patients with sickle cell disease during preg nancy is complex and should involve a multidisciplinary team consisting of high risk obstetricians, hematology, and anesthesia. Although most pregnancies result in a live birth, the rates of both maternal and fetal complications are higher as compared with age matched peers. Narcotic analgesia should be minimized during pregnancy, but is safe to use and should be prescribed during acute painful episodes (answer B). This patient is writhing in pain and will likely require intravenous opioid analgesia. The use of hydroxyurea (answer A) is relatively contraindicated Hematopoietic System Disorders 338 during pregnancy and should not be initiated at this time. Deferoxamine is a Category C drug and should only be used during pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks, which it does not in the patient in this vignette who only has a moderate increase in her ferritin (answer C). Prophylactic red blood cell transfusion (answer D) is con troversial during pregnancy, but might be considered in Hb SS patients with severe anemia (below 6 g/dL) or with significant morbidities. If there were preconception indi cations for chronic transfusion, then continuation during pregnancy would be indicated. However in the patient presented in this vignette has Hb S beta thalassemia, a hemoglobin concentration of 10.1 g/dL and no end or gan complications, and thus transfusion is not currently indicated. The routine use of antibiotics without signs of infection is discouraged (answer E)."
6 ),D,"The patient in this vignette had mild bone pain throughout life, two episodes of pneumonia, a moderate microcytic anemia, and a blood smear showing target and sickle cells. In addition, one parent has a mild anemia (likely beta+ thalassemia) and another parent had a normal CBC (likely sickle cell trait, given a brother with sickle trait). The course of beta+ thalassemia can be quite variable, and the diag nosis is occasionally delayed into adulthood. The hb elec trophoresis in beta+ thalassemia always shows more hb S than A, and the A2 band is typically elevated (answer D). The electrophoretic pattern in answer A is consistent with Hb SS sickle cell anemia. The electrophoresis in answer B is typical of sickle cell trait in which the Hb A is typi cally higher than Hb S. Sickle cell trait would not be asso ciated with pain crisis, microcytosis, anemia, or the blood smear shown in this vignette. Answer C is consistent with beta0 thalassemia where no Hb A is produced. The anemia is typically more severe and the clinical course typically worse than presented in this vignette. Answer E represents a normal hemoglobin electrophoresis."
8 mg/dL LFTs Normal       Your recommendations at this time include:  ,B,"The time of transition from pediatric to adult care can be very difficult for both the patient and adult provider. This is especially true in complex diseases such as sickle cell anemia. The time of transition is a good time to review current therapies and set up long term treatment plans. Changing therapy plans that have been in place for long periods of time can be difficult for the patient, but may be necessary. Given her frequent pain crises and hospital ad missions, she should be placed on hydroxyurea, based on the results of the randomized MSH trial, which showed a reduction in the median rate of painful vasoocclusive events by almost 50% (2.5 vs. 4.5 crises per year). Hy droxyurea was also associated with a decreased incidence of acute chest syndrome and a reduction in the need for transfusions (answer B). As she does not have a history of stroke, abnormal transcranial Dopplers, or other end or gan complications, chronic transfusion therapy is not in dicated (answer A). Penicillin prophylaxis is indicated for children less than 5 years of age, but its role has not been proven in adults (answer C). Lisinopril is indicated given the proteinuria noted on urinalysis (answer D). Although narcotic analgesics should always be used with extreme caution, based on her history of frequent pain crisis and hospital admissions, chronic long acting opioids are cur rently indicated in this patient (answer E). If hydroxyurea is successful in decreasing the frequency of painful epi sodes, then weaning off narcotics should be attempted in the future."
"6 mg/dL       In addition to fluids, narcotic analgesia, and oxygen,  which of the following is the best management",A,"Priapism, defined as a sustained penile erection in the absence of sexual stimulation, should be considered a medical emergency, as impotence and chronic sexual dysfunction can occur if left untreated. Urgent urologic evaluation for aspiration and irrigation of the corpus cavernosum is indicated and is considered the standard of care for priapism lasting more than 4 hours (answer A). Unfortunately, neither simple nor exchange RBC transfu sion has proven beneficial, but may be considered in re fractory cases (answers B and D). In addition, exchange transfusion in patients with priapism has been associated with headaches, seizures, and other neurologic sequela (ASPEN syndrome), and care should be taken to keep the posttransfusion Hb below 10 g/dL. A distal penile shunt might be necessary in cases refractory to aspiration and irrigation, but should not be initial therapy (answer C). Proximal shunting may be required if distal shunting fails, but is associated with higher rates of impotence. Hydroxyurea would not be beneficial in the acute setting, but could be considered as secondary prophylaxis of stut tering priapism, although randomized data supporting its efficacy is lacking (answer E). Pseudoephedrine, other alpha and beta adrenergic agonists, antiandrogens, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have also been used for sec ondary prophylaxis based on limited data."
A 20-year-old woman with hemoglobin SS presents to your  clinic after being discharged from the hospital. She was admit - ted for a vasooclussive pain episode and required IV narcotics  for pain management. She has been admitted to the hospital  5 times this year for pain management and was diagnosed  with acute chest syndrome during a previous hospital admis - sion. Her outpatient pain management regimen includes both  short- and long-acting opioids. She takes folic acid daily and  is up-to-date on all of her health maintenance. Which of the  following medications should be considered at this time,D,"Hydroxyurea (HU) is a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that increases fetal hemoglobin and hydration of erythro cytes. HU has been shown to decrease painful episodes, hospitalizations, acute chest syndrome, and improve survival in randomized studies of patients with hemo globin SS and hemoglobin S beta0 thalassemia. Thus it is indicated for patients with sickle cell anemia with three or more moderate to severe painful episodes per year, re current sickle cell disease associated pain that interferes with daily activity and quality of life, history of recurrent or severe acute chest syndrome, or symptomatic anemia. None of the other answers have shown to reduce mor tality or vasoocclusive episodes in individual with sickle cell anemia."
7 .       Which protein is most likely to be abnormal in this patient,B,"The patient presented in this vignette has chronic fatigue, jaundice, and splenomegaly. Her labs are consistent with a hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes, which can be seen in both HS and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The positive family and chronicity of symptoms make HS the much more likely diagnosis. The molecular pathophysiology of HS can be quite diverse with mutations occurring in ankyrin, spec trin, or band 3 (answer B). As in this vignette, the most common form of HS follows a autosomal dominant pat tern of inheritance. A PIG A mutation would be seen in PNH, which would typically present with an acquired intravascular hemolysis. In addition, there would not be a positive family history, splenomegaly, or spherocytes on the blood smear (answer A). A mutation in an Rh associ ated glycoprotein may lead to Rh null disease, which is a cause of hereditary stomatocytosis, which was not seen on the blood smear (answer C). Pyruvate kinase deficien cy typically follows an AR mode of inheritance and echi nocytes are classically seen on the blood smear (answer D). G 6PD deficiency typically follows an X linked inher itance, leads to episodic hemolysis, and in the acute phase would present with blister or bite cells on the peripheral smear (answer E).Hematopoietic System Disorders 339"
"1%       In addition to the consideration of a blood transfusion,  which of the following should be recommended",C,"The patient presented in this vignette has a known chronic hemolytic anemia. He now presents with acute worsening of his chronic anemia along with symptoms of a recent viral syndrome. He works in a kindergarten and was likely exposed to parvovirus B 19, leading to an aplastic crisis. As the red cell life span in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias is markedly reduced, even brief periods of decreased red cell production can lead to significant anemia. In immunocompetent individu als the infection and suppression of erythropoiesis typi cally resolves on its own and supportive care is all that is necessary (answer C). Although splenectomy may be very effective in treating symptomatic chronic anemia secondary to hereditary spherocytosis, this patient has a baseline hemoglobin of 10–11 g/dL, and splenectomy would not be indicated, especially at the current time (answer A). There is no effective antiviral agent for par vovirus B 19, and acyclovir or IVIg can be effective at treating chronic parvovirus B 19 infection in immuno suppressed individuals, but is typically not necessary in immunocompetent patients (answer D). Steroids would not be effective in treating aplastic crisis secondary to parvovirus B 19 (answer E)."
5 mg/dL LDH 193 IU/mL Review of the peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts  and normal red blood cell and platelet morphology.       What is the most likely etiology for the episode of acute  hemolytic anemia during induction chemotherapy,D,"The African American man patient presented in this vi gnette has an acquired hemolytic anemia after exposure to rasburicase, an oxidant drug known to induce hemol ysis in G 6PD deficient individuals. He also describes a similar event after exposure to trimethoprim sulfameth oxasole. His G 6PD level was normal, but was meas ured during the acute hemolytic period. In the African American variant of G 6PD deficiency, levels of G6PD are higher in young reticulocytes, and enzyme levels may be normal if measured during an acute hemolytic event. In addition, the lack of bite or blister cells on the blood smear 3 weeks after the hemolytic event is to be expected. These classic blood smear findings are typi cally seen only during an acute hemolytic episode af ter which these damaged RBCs are quickly removed from circulation. A G 6PD level sent after recovery from the acute event could confirm the suspected diagnosis (answer D). There is no information provided in the vi gnette suggesting AIHA, HS, HUS, or CAD as a more likely diagnosis (answers A–C and E)."
"A 21-year-old African-American man is diagnosed with a  urinary tract infection, which is treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethaxazole. Approximately 1 week after initiating  antibiotics he presents with jaundice, scleral icterus, and  anemia. Additional labs are ordered, including haptoglobin  (low), LDH (elevated), and indirect bilirubin (increased).  Supravital stain on the peripheral blood smear confirms  the presence of Heinz bodies.     What is the mode of inheritance of the most likely cause  for his clinical and laboratory presentation",A,"G6PD deficiency is inherited in an X linked recessive pattern. The clinical and laboratory values presented in the stem are classic for the diagnosis, and patients with G6PD develop hemolytic anemia after exposure to oxi dant drugs, such as trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole."
8 ):       What is the most likely diagnosis,E,"PK deficiency is the most common enzymopathy of the glycolytic pathway and accounts for greater than 80% of all such defects. The clinical course of PK deficiency is quite heterogeneous, but patients usually have only mild to moderate symptoms secondary to elevated 2,3 DPG levels and a shift of the hemoglobin oxygen dis sociation curve to the left. In pyruvate kinase deficiency, echinocytes (secondary to RBC dehydration as shown in the accompanying blood smear) may be seen on the pe ripheral blood smear (answer E). A pyruvate kinase level should be ordered to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The patient’s blood smear would not be consistent with the other diagnoses listed. In G 6 PD deficiency bite or blister cells would be seen in the acute phase of hemol ysis (answer A). In hereditary spherocytosis or autoim mune hemolytic anemia, spherocytes would be seen on the blood smear (answers B and C). In alpha thalassemia target cells would be expected (answer D)."
"5 mg/dL LDH 876 IU/mL Peripheral blood smear reveals: spherocytes, macrov- alocytes, and normal white blood cell and platelet  morphology. A Coombs test is sent.       Which of the following is the most likely result on the  Coombs test",B,"The patient presented in this vignette presents with new onset hemolytic anemia. Her history of rheumatoid ar thritis, in conjunction with spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, makes warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA) the most likely diagnosis. In WAIHA anemia the Coombs test is either strongly + for IgG and negative for complement (not listed as a answer) or strongly + for IgG and weakly + for complement as IgG does not fix com plement strongly (answer B). Answer A would represent a negative Coombs test. There is no reason to expect the Coombs test should not be interpretable in WAIHA (an swer C). The pattern in answer D is one you might expect in cold agglutinin disease as the antibody is an IgM, which fixes complement efficiently."
"0 mg/dL LDH 750 IU/mL       Review of the peripheral blood smear is significant for  spherocytes, occasional reticulocytes, normal white blood  cell morphology, and normal platelet morphology.       What is the most appropriate treatment",B,"In patients with CLL, previous exposure to fludarabine based chemotherapy regimens is associated with an in creased risk of developing warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA). Steroids are first line therapy for WAIHA as they interfere with the ability of macrophages to clear IgG or complement coated erythrocytes and reduce autoanti body production. Although there is emerging data support ing use of rituximab as first line therapy, published trials thus far have limitations such that rituximab is considered second line therapy. Splenectomy is also considered second line therapy. IVIg is much less effective in WAIHA as com pared with ITP and would not be considered first (or even second) line therapy. PRBC transfusion is given judiciously given the expected hemolysis of transfused blood, as well as difficulty obtaining crossmatch compatible units, and is thus reserved for severe or life threatening anemia. Given her normal vital signs and hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, PRBC transfusion would not be indicated."
"In addition to consideration of blood transfusion, which of  the following should be recommended",D,"The patient presented in this vignette has an acute coro nary syndrome, and emergent coronary revasculariza tion is recommended. He is also noted to have anemia with a markedly elevated MCV and RBC agglutination on the peripheral blood smear. The Coombs test is + for C3 only, supporting the diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease. As cardiac bypass is typically performed with cold cardioplegia, plasmapheresis should be performed preoperatively to markedly decrease the causative IgM antibody (answer D). Plasmapheresis is not a definitive treatment in and of itself, but is useful in emergent situ ations. It efficiently lowers the IgM, which is primarily intravascular, and is thus useful prior to surgical proce dures with prolonged cold exposure. Another option for surgery would be to avoid cold cardioplegia if possible, but this was not listed as a answer. Prednisone is not typically affective in cold agglutinin disease as opposed to WAIHA, unless an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder is present (answer A). Rituximab is considered among the first line treatments in cold agglutinin dis ease, but would not work quickly enough to be effective prior to bypass surgery scheduled in the next 24 hours (answer B). Splenectomy is typically not effective in cold agglutinin disease, as opposed to WAIHA, and would be contraindicated in the setting of an acute coronary Hematopoietic System Disorders 340 syndrome (answer C). Eculizumab would be indicated as first line therapy in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglo binuria or atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, but is not considered first line therapy for cold agglutinin dis ease (answer E)."
2 g/dL       What is the next most appropriate step in management,C,"Cold agglutinin disease is due to a complement fixing IgM antibody directed towards polysaccharides on the RBC surface. Direct lysis or clearance of C3b coated cells occurs primarily through the Kupffer cells of the liver. Cold agglutinins may be produced in response to infec tion or in patients with underlying lymphoproliferative disorders. In fact in most patients a small B cell clone can be identified by flow cytometry or suggested by a small monoclonal band on a serum protein electrophoresis. Treatment should be initiated for symptomatic anemia, transfusion dependence, and/or disabling circulatory symptoms. Rituximab therapy is considered pharmaco logic first line therapy as greater than 50% of patients will respond. Steroids have not been found to be effective in treatment of CAD. Splenectomy is also ineffective given that the liver is the predominant site of sequestration. Erythropoietin could be considered; however, given her degree of anemia and symptoms, she requires more ag gressive treatment. Fludarabine and rituximab have been shown to result in response in ∼75% of patients; however, fludarabine as a single agent has not been studied."
A patient who presented with a symptomatic Coombs  negative nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and mild pan - cytopenia has recently been diagnosed with paroxysmal  nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Eculizumab therapy is  considered.     Which of the following is the most likely consequence of  treatment with eculizumab in this patient,C,"Treatment of eculizumab has revolutionized the treat ment of PNH. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal an tibody that acts as an inhibitor of terminal complement, has led to markedly improved quality of life, decreased hemolysis, decreased thrombosis, and potentially in creased survival in patients with PNH. Eculizumab binds to the complement component C5 and prevents its cleav age, thus preventing activation of the membrane attack complex. In patients with PNH, the lack of surface GPI anchored proteins on the RBC surface renders the cells more susceptible to complement mediated lysis. With in hibition of lysis, the percentage of GPI deficient RBCs ac tually increases after treatment with eculizumab (answer C). Most PNH patients treated with eculizumab become transfusion independent, because the hemoglobin often fails to normalize as some degree of extravascular he molysis continues (answer A). Although the incidence of Neisseria meningitidis is increased with terminal com plement blockade, the incidence still remains quite low (answer B). Vaccination is strongly recommended prior to initiation of eculizumab. The risk of thrombosis has been shown to decrease after use of eculizumab (answer D). LDH markedly decreases and often normalizes after treatment with eculizumab and has been followed as a surrogate marker for hemolysis in patients (answer E)."
"A 25-year-old man presents with jaundice, pallor, and  left lower extremity swelling. Ultrasound confirms the  presence of a left popliteal DVT. Laboratory studies are  consistent with a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia.  FLAER testing confirms the diagnosis of paroxysmal noc - turnal hemoglobinuria. Given the degree of hemolysis  and concomitant thrombotic event, eculizumab therapy  is considered.     Which of the following should this patient receive prior to  initiating eculizumab",A,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria leads to the ab sence of two GPI anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, which leads to uncontrolled complement activation re sulting in hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and cytopenias. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits termi nal complement by binding to C5. The most serious risk of terminal complement blockade is life threatening Neis seria infections; thus all patients treated with eculizumab should be vaccinated against Neisseria. The use of eculi zumab has not been associated with HiB, hepatitis A or B, or varicella."
"2 mg/dL ADAMTS-13 NA 44% Escherichia coli   culture and  shiga toxinNA Not detected Blood smear 4–5 schistocytes/ per HPF4–5 schistocytes/ per HPF     At this time, which is the most appropriate action",B,"The differentiation between TTP , atypical HUS (aHUS), and other thrombotic microangiopathies can be difficult. As opposed to other thrombotic microangiopathies, TTP is associated with levels of ADAMTS 13 typically below 5%–10%. Levels that are decreased, but above this range, are nonspecific and can be seen a variety of conditions. In addition, a markedly elevated creatinine is unusual in TTP , while expected in atypical HUS. The degree of thrombocytopenia is often marked in TTP , while more variable and modest in aHUS. The lack of response to plasma exchange is typical in aHUS, while unusual in TTP . Given this patient’s laboratory results, which in clude a moderate decrease in ADAMTS 13, moderate thrombocytopenia, and significant acute renal failure that has worsened with plasma exchange, aHUS is the more likely diagnosis. Eculizumab should be promptly initiated in hopes of preserving renal function (answer B). The additions of rituximab, steroids, or switching to cryopoor plasma are all reasonable answers for refractory TTP (answers A, D, and E). Twice daily plasma exchange is very labor intensive but can be considered in refractory TTP patients with worsening neurologic status or clinical course, although efficacy remains unproven (answer C)."

TTP is caused by an inhibitor to ADAMTS 13 leading to ac cumulation of high molecular weight von Willebrand multimers causing small vessel thrombosis and microan giopathic hemolytic anemia. First line treatment of TTP is plasma exchange utilizing FFP as replacement fluid, thus removing the offending antibody and supplying deficient ADAMTS 13. Rituximab is considered adjunct first or second line therapy. Eculizumab could be considered if aHUS was thought to be the diagnosis. In this case, the severe neurologic sequela and only mild renal insuffi ciency make aHUS less likely. An ADAMTS 13 level can be sent, and if normal this diagnosis can be reconsidered. However, initiation of therapeutic plasma exchange can be life saving and should not be delayed while awaiting ADAMTS results. FFP could be transfused in a setting in which plasmapheresis is not available, but 2 units would not be considered an effective dose. Prednisone may also be utilized as an adjunct to plasmapheresis, but its effi cacy remains uncertain."
"A 22-year-old African-American man has Hgb-SS  disease, which has been complicated by cholelithi - asis requiring cholecystectomy; bilateral avascular  necrosis of the femoral heads; two episodes of acute  chest ; and a stroke at 16 years of age, with minimal   right-sided weakness. He was started on simple exchange  transfusion, but due to nonadherence to oral iron chela - tion, the patient developed iron overload, characterized by  a ferritin level of 2481 (11 - 209). As a result, he was tran - sitioned to monthly erythrocytapheresis, with goal Hgb-S  levels ≤50%. He has now transitioned to the Adult Hema - tology Clinic, and since he has experienced no recurrent  episodes of stroke, he is now inquiring about stopping his  monthly sessions of red cell exchange.     Given that he is now an adult, which of the following is the  best recommendation",A,"It is recognized that there are risks and costs that are asso ciated with transfusion therapy, be it simple or exchange. This includes iron overload; financial costs; need for in travenous access; risk for alloimmunization; and incon venience for the patient and/or their family. Nonetheless, transfusion therapy is still considered the treatment of choice for secondary prevention of stroke and is preferred over hydroxyurea therapy. There is no known benefit to allowing the Hgb S level to rise >50%, and it would not be expected to provide any benefit to the patient."
5% Hgb-F <1%       Which of the following laboratory tests will confirm the  most likely diagnosis,D,"Based upon her history physical examination and the available laboratory data, the patient most likely has α thalassemia trait. The definitive diagnosis would entail analysis of her α globin genes, either by a multiplex li gation dependent probe amplification assay or by direct sequencing of the α globin genes. In this case, α globin Hematopoietic System Disorders 341 sequencing showed homozygosity for a rightward single α globin gene deletion (– α3.7/–α3.7). The presence of two α globin gene deletions is known as “trans alpha thalas semia” or “alpha thalassemia 2,” which is a chronic and overall clinically silent condition. It is important to recog nize this as a cause of chronic and constant microcytosis so that patients and their family members are not misdi agnosed and/or mistreated. While copper deficiency, usually stemming from zinc tox icity, or lead poisoning can cause a microcytosis, this is coupled with anemia. Similarly, the presence of sidero blasts, either congenital or acquired, is accompanied by anemia, which this patient does not have."

As a result, initial treatment with high dose steroids is con sidered to be first line therapy. While WAIHA can be treated with rituximab, this is not considered first line therapy. The absence of complement deposition noted on the DAT does not support a cold au toimmune hemolytic anemia, making the use of warm ing interventions superfluous. While splenectomy can be used either as first line therapy for hereditary sphero cytosis or as second line therapy for WAIHA, this is not indicated at this time. Even though there is evidence of hemolysis, the CBC and peripheral smear do not support the presence of a microangiopathy, making plasma ex change an incorrect choice."

In addition, which of the following should be performed  next for this patient",E,"The overwhelming majority of cold agglutinin disease is mediated by an IgM antibody, which is often associated with an underlying condition, which can be discerned in part by the clonality of the IgM autoantibody. Specifically, a monoclonal IgM would result from either MGUS or Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Polyclonal IgM is seen following an infection, typically in children. A bone marrow biopsy would be indicated if there was concern for lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, but a SPEP should be considered first. There is no reason to sus pect paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, making flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 testing an incorrect choice. Cryoglobulins can be associated with anemia and symptoms worsened by exposure to cold tempera tures; however, this is not associated with a Coombs(+) hemolytic anemia.

Given that the other causes of macrocytosis are not supported by the data (cytopenia, ethanol toxicity, B12/folate deficiency, and hypothyroidism), bone marrow biopsy is not indi cated. In B12 deficiency, homocysteine levels are also elevated, which makes methylmalonic acid testing an incorrect choice.

In this case, the pa tient’s methemoglobin level was 70.4% (0.4–1.5), which is considered a medical emergency. Immediate infusion of methylene blue led to a symptomatic improvement, but a paradoxical increase in met Hgb levels to 81.5% (0.4–1.5), prompting emergent erythrocytapheresis, where his plas ma was noted to be markedly discolored ( RED ARROW ) compared with normal plasma ( GREEN ARROW ). This was found to be from continued exposure on his skin, prompting immediate removal and extensive skin scrub bing. After additional doses of methylene blue and the erythrocytapheresis, his met Hgb level was measured at 17.7 (0.4–1.5). Carboxyhemoglobin levels are measured in individuals suffering carbon monoxide poisoning, which does not lead to this constellation of findings. Patients with G6PD deficiency may have hemolysis following methylene blue administration, but the life threatening nature of this case mandates methylene blue use, despite potential risk of hemolysis.

Which of the following is most likely responsible for these  findings,A,"The differential for microcytic anemia includes iron defi ciency, thalassemia, or anemia of chronic inflammation. A history of anemia unresponsive to iron and a family history of anemia support a diagnosis of thalassemia. Furthermore, the normal red cell distribution width also favors thalassemia over iron deficiency. The patient has no history to suggest anemia of chronic inflamma tion, which results in disrupted normal iron utilization secondary to an increased level of hepcidin.

In cases of alpha thalassemia trait, the hemoglobin electrophoresis results will be normal. However, beta thalassemia trait can be de tected on hemoglobin electrophoresis by the presence of an elevated hemoglobin A2, as is the case here. This abnormal hemoglobin results from the pairing of alpha globin chains with delta globin chains secondary to the reduced production of beta globin chains. In addition, microcytosis is usually out of proportion to the degree of anemia in beta thalassemia trait. Thalassemia trait does not require treatment. However, patients should receive genetic counseling and should avoid taking iron supple mentation unless he/she develops iron deficiency. The absence of hemoglobin S on electrophoresis eliminates sickle cell trait as a possible explanation. In addition, the complete blood count is normal in patients with sickle cell trait."

In beta thalassemia, decreased β chain synthesis leads to impaired production of the α2β2 tetramer of normal Hb A. In sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) Hb A is not detectable since the normal β chain is not pro duced. Also, the Hb F level is often elevated (up to 10%), and Hb S levels are usually greater than 80%. In sickle cell trait, hemoglobin A is found in greater proportion than hemoglobin S, and hemoglobin A2 is not increased. In stead, Hb S and Hb C are usually present in equal propor tions on Hgb electrophoresis (45%–50% each) and Hb F is present 7%8%. In HbS/ beta0 thalassemia, Hb A is again undetectable since there is no production of β chains. Hb S is approximately 80%, Hb A2 5%–8%, and Hb F 10%– 20%.

SCIC is an uncommon but severe form of sickle hepatopathy with high mortality rates. The pathophysiology involves sickling in the hepatic sinusoids, which leads to hypoxic injury and swelling of hepatocytes causing a direct back pressure effect and resultant intracanalicular cholestasis. SCIC presents with acute right upper quadrant abdomi nal pain, jaundice, severe conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, moderately elevated liver enzymes, acute kidney injury, and occasionally coagulopathy. SCIC can progress rap idly to acute liver failure. In SCIC exchange transfusion is the preferable treatment of choice although this has not been rigorously studied. Maintaining HbS levels of less than 20%–30% is recommended by experts. While other causes of liver disease not specific to sickle cell patient should be excluded, a liver biopsy is a relative contraindi cation because of risk of bleeding and liver rupture. Hy droxyurea therapy has not been shown to be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of SCIC. In cholestasis, the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid can improve biliary flow; however, in this patient, exchange transfusion is the more urgent treatment of choice."

Which of the following treatments is most likely to lead to  an improvement in symptoms",A,"This patient likely has previously undiagnosed hereditary spherocytosis (HS) based on her chronic hyperprolifera tive anemia, personal and family history of gallstones, and Caucasian race. The pathophysiology of HS is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of one of the constituents of the red cell cytoskeleton whose role is to maintain the shape, deformability, and elasticity of the red cell. The laboratory features of HS include a normocytic or microcytic anemia, elevated MCHC, signs of hemolysis with increased LDH and decreased haptoglobin, increased spherocytes on pe ripheral blood smear, and a negative Coombs test, which rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Spherocytes are destroyed solely in the spleen, and therefore splenectomy is very effective in controlling the anemia but does not correct the underlying red blood cell defect. Prednisone would be treatment of choice in warm autoimmune hemo lytic anemia. Rituximab can be used in both warm and cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia but has no role in HS.

His direct antiglobulin test indicates that he has hemolytic anemia of the cold ag glutinin subtype. In primary cold agglutinin disease, the majority of patients are found to have a small monoclo nal paraprotein on SPEP/IFE due to a small monoclonal B cell population. The treatment of choice in these patients is rituximab based therapy. A proportion of patients will respond to single agent rituximab. Splenectomy and pred nisone are treatments for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Since hemolysis of C3b coated red blood cells in cold agglutinin disease occurs outside the spleen, splenec tomy is not useful. Prednisone has also not been shown to be effective in cold agglutinin disease. Plasmapheresis can be used in the acute setting of cold agglutinin disease to remove acutely, for example preoperatively, in patients undergoing operations requiring thermal cooling."

Preoperative transfusion decreases sickle cell related perioperative complications but can be associated with acute transfu sion reactions, alloimmunization, and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. The Transfusion Alternatives Pre operatively in Sickle Cell Disease (TAPS) Study evaluated a preoperative transfusion strategy versus no preopera tive transfusion in HbSS and Hb S beta0 thalassemia pa tient undergoing low risk or medium risk operations. Patients randomized to the transfusion arm received ei ther a conservative transfusion (if baseline hemoglobin was <9 g/dL) to target goal Hb 10 g/dL or red blood cell exchange transfusion (if baseline hemoglobin was >9 g/ dL) to target HbS less than 60%. Preoperative transfusion resulted in less preoperative complications, particularly acute chest syndrome. While this patient should be start ed on hydroxyurea for long term management of his sick le cell disease given his history of acute chest syndrome, it is not indicated to decrease perioperative complications. Sickle cell disease patients are considered at higher risk for venous thromboembolism than the general popula tion.

Her hemolysis testing is positive, her MCV is high, and a direct antiglobulin test detects C3 coat ed red blood cells. Cold agglutinin disease is a form of au toimmune hemolytic anemia in which the autoantibodies, or cold agglutinins (CA), are defined by the ability to ag glutinate RBCs at cold temperatures. The CA are directed against the I or i antigens on red blood cells. Most CA are monoclonal IgM, which can be picked up on routine SPEP testing. The IgM then fixes complement, and these C3b coated red blood cells are removed from circulation by the liver’s reticuloendothelial system. In primary cold agglu tinin disease, no underlying systemic disorder explains the autoantibodies. However, the majority of primary cold agglutinin disease is associated with a monoclonal para protein (usually IgM) and a monoclonal B cell clone iden tified on flow cytometry. Secondary cold agglutinin dis ease is associated with infections and lymphoproliferative disorders, such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Cryo globulin testing is used to diagnose cryoglobulinemia. In cryoglobulinemia, immunoglobulins become insoluble at room reduced temperatures as compared with cold ag glutinin disease in which agglutination of red blood cells occur. Osmotic fragility testing is used to diagnose heredi tary spherocytosis. ANA testing may be indicated in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, as systemic lupus erythe matosus is associated with this disorder."
2 mg/ dL        A hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed the presence of  no hemoglobin ,C,"Alloimmunization to RBC antigens is a major complica tion of transfusion and the underlying cause of the major ity of delayed hemolytic transfusions reactions (DHTR). DHTR presents within 5–10 days following a transfusion of RBC. In patients with sickle cell disease, racial differ ences between recipient (predominantly African Ameri cans) and donor (predominantly Caucasians) expression of RBC antigens are thought to contribute to the increased risk of alloimmunization. DHTR often presents similarly to a vasoocclusive pain crisis and therefore is often under diagnosed. In addition to symptoms of a pain crisis, sickle cell patients with DHTR will present with reticulocytope nia and a lower hemoglobin compared with before trans fusion. The worsening anemia represents a combination of hemolysis of previously transfused cells (hence the lack of HbA on electrophoresis), “bystander hyperhemolysis” from an immune response causing hemolysis of the recip ient’s red blood cells, and suppression of erythropoiesis. While a direct antiglobulin test and indirect antiglobulin test (antibody screen) are recommended to evaluate for new alloantibodies or autoantibodies causing a hemolytic reaction, these serologic studies are sometimes equivocal. If DHTR is suspected, treatment consists of minimizing further red blood cell transfusion, high dose steroids, high doses of erythropoietin stimulating agents, and in travenous immunoglobulin."
2 mg/dL Direct   antiglobulin testNegative Negative        Which of the following is most likely to be found on the  patient’s peripheral smear,A,"Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an X linked disorder, is the most common enzymatic dis order of red blood cells. The clinical phenotype of G6PD deficiency varies considerably, with a significant portion of patients being clinically silent. The likelihood of de veloping hemolysis and the severity of disease are deter mined by the magnitude of the enzyme deficiency based on the underlying genetic variant (class I–IV) and degree of oxidative challenge. The hallmark of the most common variant is acute hemolytic crisis after exposure to a variety of drugs (e.g., nitrofurantoin) or oxidant stressors. G6PD deficiency should be considered in any patient with non immune (i.e., Coombs negative) hemolysis. On the acute hemolytic setting, oxidative denaturation of hemoglobin leads to the crosslinking of the denatured globin to the red cell membrane. This results in accumulation of hemo globin to one side of the cell adjacent to unstained non hemoglobin containing portion within the rest of the cell. On a peripheral blood smear, these changes manifest as “bite cells” or “blister cells.” Cresyl blue supravital stains of the peripheral blood may also reveal the denatured globin as Heinz bodies during hemolytic episodes."

The next diagnostic test to order is:  ",D,"The method used to establish the diagnosis of G6PD de ficiency is based upon testing the normal function of the enzyme. G6PD catalyzes the initial step in the hexose monophosphate (or pentose phosphate) shunt, which is the only red cell source of reduced NADPH, a cofactor important in glutathione metabolism. Screening tests for G6PD deficiency include the florescent spot test, which is based on the fluorescence of NADPH as the end prod uct. More definitive quantitative assays are available for confirmation. Of note, false negative results can occur if the most severely deficiency red cells have already been removed from circulation via hemolysis. Therefore di agnostic tests should be postponed until the patient re covers from the acute hemolytic episode. Hemoglobin electrophoresis would be sent if an underlying hemoglo binopathy is suspected as a cause of hemolysis. Paroxys mal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is detected by showing that peripheral blood cells are deficient in glycophos phatidylinositol (GPI) linked proteins such as CD55 and CD59, by flow cytometry.

Further, absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum requires the presence of intrin sic factor produced by the parietal cells of the stomach. Vitamin B12 deficiency causing anemia can present sev eral years after bypass surgery since vitamin B12 storage depletion takes many years and high dose oral vitamin B12 supplementation is very effective for prevention of this micronutrient deficiency. Severe vitamin B12 defi ciency can present with pancytopenia, significantly el evated LDH levels, and bone marrow biopsy findings can mimic findings of myelodysplastic syndrome. This patient was not taking oral vitamin B12 supplementa tion after her surgery. To restore vitamin B12 levels in the acute setting, intramuscular or subcutaneous vitamin B12 should be prescribed for this patient."
14 . Which of the fol - lowing is the best explanation for the patient’s positive  direct antiglobulin test,A,"This patient has features of autoimmune hemolytic ane mia as evidence by a macrocytic hyperproliferative ane mia and positive hemolysis markers. The peripheral smear shows increased spherocytes, which is consistent with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA). The patient has SLE, a disease that is associated with WAIHA. The diagnostic workup for suspected hemolytic anemia includes a direct antiglobulin test (also known as the di rect Coomb test). In a patient with autoimmune hemo lytic anemia, the blood sample containing red blood cells Hematopoietic System Disorders 345 with attached human anti RBC antibodies is washed and then incubated with antihuman antibodies (the Coomb reagent). RBC agglutination occurs because the antihu man antibodies form links between RBCs by binding to the human antibodies on the RBCs. In WAIHA the DAT is typically positive for IgG and negative for C3. In cold ag glutinin disease, the DAT is positive for C3 only. Answer B describes an indirect Coombs test."

Her ferritin improved to normal range with oral iron therapy. She still has a mild microcytic anemia. This should prompt inves tigation for alpha thalassemia trait (two gene deletions). Alpha thalassemia trait cannot be identified on hemo globin electrophoresis, and instead, DNA analysis must be ordered. She likely does not have sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) since these patients are not usually microcytic and baseline hemoglobin is usually lower. She does not have sickle cell trait as these patients have neither anemia nor microcytosis (assuming no other concurrent causes of anemia)."
"1%     Based upon his hemoglobin electrophoresis, what is the  most likely diagnosis",B,"Sickle cell trait is characterized by Hb A 60% and Hb S 40% on hemoglobin electrophoresis. Patients with hemo globin SS typically have >90% Hb S, <3.5% Hb A 2, and <10% Hb F on electrophoresis. In Sickle beta+ thalassemia, Hb S is >60%, Hb A is 10%–30%, and A2 is >3.5%. In pa tients with hemoglobin SC, Hb S is 50% and C and A 2 migrate to the same position on alkaline electrophoresis, so it likely will be reported as A 2 = 50%."
5%). Which of the following is the most likely  diagnosis,B,"Patients with beta thalassemia minor (one normal beta globin allele) are noted to have mild anemia, microcyto sis, target cells, and basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear. Hemoglobin electrophoresis will confirm an elevated A 2 fraction. The alpha thalassemia carrier state is clinically silent, and hemoglobin electrophoresis is nor mal for both the 1 and 2 gene deletions (alpha thalassemia minor). Patients with beta thalassemia major are typically transfusion dependent and have a higher hemoglobin F fraction on hemoglobin electrophoresis. Hemoglobin H disease is incorrect, as hemoglobin H was not reported on the hemoglobin electrophoresis, and individuals with this condition are often transfusion dependent by the second decade of life."

Females are affected in approximately 30% of cases. Although the peripheral smear could also be suggestive of severe iron deficiency or thalassemia, the iron studies and hemo globin electrophoresis do not support either diagnosis in this case. Myelodysplastic syndrome remains on the dif ferential diagnosis; however, her history of “vitamin re sponsive” anemia and young age make XLSA more likely. The anemia of XLSA is pyridoxine responsive in the ma jority of cases."
The patient has a his - tory of red blood cell alloantibodies.       What is the most likely cause of the patient’s fever,A,"The acute chest syndrome (ACS) in a sickle cell patient is characterized by the presence of fever and/or respira tory distress with a new infiltrate on CXR. The etiology of ACS is multifactorial, with pulmonary infection identi fied in many cases. In adults, the most common bacterial cause identified is Chlamydophila pneumoniae. ACS should be recognized and treated promptly."
"74 mg/dL. AST, ALT, and total  bilirubin are within the limits of normal.     What is the most likely cause of the acute drop in hemo - globin and platelet counts",D,"Acute splenic sequestration is a serious complication that is generally seen in childhood in patients with sickle cell anemia, but may present in adulthood in patients with “milder” disease forms, such as hemoglobin SC disease. In many cases, LUQ pain and fever are absent, with pa tients instead complaining of pain elsewhere. The drop in both hemoglobin and platelet count coupled with tender splenomegaly and acute onset argue against bone mar row suppression by parvovirus B19 infection. IV hydra tion is unlikely the culprit given that his values are drop ping well below his known baseline levels along with the tender splenomegaly. There is no evidence of hemolysis by laboratory assessment or peripheral blood smear. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia is less likely given the drop in both hemoglobin and platelets."
15 .        Which of the following is the most likely explanation for  the patient’s hyperbilirubinemia,A,"This man developed progressive anemia and hyperbili rubinemia over the course of 4 days, with concomitant improvement in his serum creatinine and uric acid. He re ceived rasburicase to help prevent tumor lysis syndrome. Blister cells and bite cells are demonstrated on the periph eral blood smear. This finding is characteristic of hemoly sis due to G6PD deficiency. Rasburicase is well known to cause both an oxidative hemolytic anemia and methemo globinemia in patients with underlying G6PD deficiency. The management of oxidative hemolysis secondary to a drug is removal of the offending agent and supportive care, including folic acid and red blood cell transfusion as needed."

Which of the following is the next best step in evaluating  her anemia,D,"Although basophilic stippling is not pathognomonic for lead poisoning, the constellation of fatigue, myalgias, ab dominal pain, and history of lead exposure (stained glass) with basophilic stippling make lead toxicity a primary consideration. That she does not recall previously having anemia makes thalassemia a less likely cause of her micro cytic anemia with basophilic stippling. Her serum ferritin does not indicate iron deficiency. The normal platelet and WBC count make the marrow less likely to be revealing."

Which of the fol - lowing is the next best step in the diagnostic evaluation,A,"First line testing for patients with suspected porphyria cutanea tarda is to evaluate for elevated porphyrin levels. This can be done from the blood or spot urine. Testing erythrocyte porphyrins would be a reasonable first step if erythropoietic protoporphyria or X linked protopor phyria (nonblistering skin lesions) were suspected, but they are not in this case. While approximately 20% of PCT cases will harbor a UROD gene mutation, the mutation in itself is not diagnostic of PCT; it is just indicative of an underlying susceptibility to develop PCT. PCT is often associated with mutations in the HFE gene, alcohol use, smoking, and hepatitis C infection. Evaluation for these associated issues is warranted if PCT is identified."
79 mg/dL AST 34 U/L ALT 45 U/L        Which of the following is the next best step in managing  this patient’s low SpO 2,B,"This patient has dapsone induced methemoglobinemia as evidenced by the mismatch between the pulse oxi metry and arterial blood gas oxygenation coupled with the increased methemoglobin level. Dapsone is a well recognized cause of methemoglobinemia. This patient Hematopoietic System Disorders 346 presents with asymptomatic methemoglobinemia with a methemoglobin level of 15%. In this scenario, simply withholding further dapsone is reasonable manage ment. Patients with symptoms or methemoglobin lev els greater than 20% are primarily considered for acute treatment, generally with methylene blue. However, methylene blue can further exacerbate anemia in pa tients with underlying G6PD deficiency, and thus in this nonemergent case, simply discontinuing dapsone is the primary consideration."
Which of the following is the next best step in the man - agement of this patient,A,"Although previously an integral part of the evaluation of hereditary hemochromatosis, liver biopsy for meas urement of hepatic iron concentration and morphology was used prior to the availability of genetic testing for HFE gene mutations. Presently, serum ferritin is used as a surrogate for the presence of cirrhosis, noting that patients with a serum ferritin of greater than 1000 μg/L have an increased risk of cirrhosis. Patients with other reasons for underlying liver dysfunction (metabolic syn drome, hepatitis C) also have an increased risk. In gener al, only those patients at highest risk are recommended to undergo initial liver biopsy to evaluate underlying cirrhosis. This patient will likely benefit from therapeutic phlebot omy to reduce the serum ferritin, with a goal of less than 50 μg/L. In general, each phlebotomy of 500 mL can low er the serum ferritin by 30 μg/L."

A mutation in which of the following genes is most likely  to be responsible for the patient’s symptoms",D,"This patient is suspected to have juvenile hemochromato sis as evidenced by (1) iron overload; (2) early symptom onset; and (3) presentation with cardiomyopathy, diabe tes, and hypogonadism rather than liver disease. Muta tions within the HJV gene are primarily responsible for this disease and appear to result in decreased levels of hepcidin. HFE1 gene mutations lead to classic hemochro matosis, which can also arise from mutations within TFR2 (transferrin receptor 2). Mutations within TTR (tran sthyretin) lead to amyloidosis."

Over the last few weeks, several  of his classmates have been diagnosed with influenza. He  now presents with a headache, fever, and neck stiffness ×  1 day. Influenza testing will be delayed due to reagent  backorder. In the interim, what is the next best step in the  management of this patient",C,"Note that the meningococcal vaccine only covers sero variant B, and meningococcal infection may occur despite vaccination."
0 g/dL range.       The patient is advised to stay warm.       What additional therapy is recommended,A,"Cold agglutinin disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis, and direct antiglobulin testing positive for complement (an ti C3) and negative for IgG. The underlying antibody is generally IgM as opposed to paroxysmal cold hemoglo binuria in which an IgG is present. Additionally, the cold agglutinin titer is typically elevated in cold agglutinin disease and only mildly so in PCH. Hemoglobinuria, if present, is typically mild in CAD as opposed to PCH. The most common causes of cold agglutinin disease are infec tions (such as Mycoplasma ) and underlying hematologic disorders. In this case, the patient is young and presented with an infection (possibly Mycoplasma ) approximately 3 weeks before the onset of hemolytic symptoms, classic for infectious associated CAD. It is expected that full recov ery will occur within 4 weeks. If the patient was older, has more serious hemolysis, does not have a preceding infection, or has hemolysis that is not resolving, investi gation of underlying disorders in addition to rituximab ± corticosteroids should be considered."
Which of the following laboratory tests has the highest  sensitivity and specificity for the suspected condition,A,"Although osmotic fragility testing is expected to be positive in cases of hereditary spherocytosis, it lacks specificity, as spherocytes resulting from any cause are expected to have abnormal fragility. The eosin 5 ′ maleimide binding test is a flow cytometric based assay that evaluates the interaction between the dye eosin 5 ′ maleimide and the band 3 protein. It has a reported 89%– 96% sensitivity and 94%–99% specificity and has largely supplanted osmotic fragility testing. Spectrin mutations will be present in some cases of hereditary sphero cytosis; however, mutations in band 3 and ankyrin are also found."
89 mg/dL        Which of the following patterns of iron regulatory pro - teins would be expected,D,"Hepcidin is a key regulator in iron homeostasis. Hepcidin (a bacteriocidal protein) is expected to be increased in in flammatory states leading to anemia of chronic disease. In iron deficiency resulting from iron losses (in this case, a multiparous woman), hepcidin is expected to be sup pressed, thereby allowing increased iron absorption. Fer roportin, the hepcidin receptor, is expected to be normal to increased when hepcidin decreased, as it is not inter nalized in the absence of hepcidin."
"An 18-year-old African-American woman with known  sickle cell trait presents for recommendations regarding  beginning a “boot camp” exercise program, as she has  heard that such intense exercise regimens can lead to sud - den death in persons with sickle cell trait. She has no other   medical conditions, is physically fit, and has no family  history of sudden death.     Which of the following is the most appropriate recom - mendation",D,"While persons with the sickle cell trait do not have the overt sickling manifestations and complications as those with sickle cell anemia, they do have an underly ing predisposition to venous thromboembolism, chron ic kidney disease, and rhabdomyolysis with intensive exercise. The risk of rhabdomyolysis with intensive exercise led the NCAA to institute a policy of screen ing for sickle trait among its athletes, a policy that was not endorsed by the American Society of Hematology. Strategies to mitigate the development of rhabdomyol ysis (such as hydration and rest) among all individuals have been used successfully in intensive training regi mens, such as that utilized in the US Army, with suc cess. Thus this patient should be advised of maintain ing adequate hydration and taking rest periods to help prevent complications from extreme exercise in the setting of the sickle cell trait, but need not completely avoid such activities."

Which of the following is the next best step in evaluating her  microcytic, hypochromic anemia",A,"This patient has microcytic, hypochromic anemia with a normal RDW, peripheral smear showing target cells and normal iron indices. Further, her hemoglobin electropho resis pattern is normal. Taken together, a high likelihood of alpha thalassemia minor exists. A thorough family history is warranted in cases of alpha thalassemia mi nor to better assess genetic risks to offspring. In general, alpha thalassemia minor in patients of African descent is inherited in the trans configuration dominates, posing little risk of hydrops fetalis. In non African patients with alpha thalassemia minor, cis configurations are more common, and there is an increased risk for both hemo globin H disease and hydrops fetalis."
"9, and platelets  are 455,000 × 109/L.     Which of the following substances is most likely respon - sible for the patient’s condition",A,"Levamisole was formerly paired with 5 fluorouracil as a treatment for colon cancer, but its only legal use now is a deworming agent for livestock. Illicitly, it is used to cut cocaine. Levamisole adds bulk and weight to powdered cocaine and makes the drug appear purer. Additionally, it is felt to possibly potentiate cocaine’s stimulant effects. It has a similar appearance to cocaine, and an ability to Hematopoietic System Disorders 347 pass street purity tests. It can lead to agranulocytosis and a necrotizing vasculitis as well as a glomerulonephritis. Quinine has been used to adulterate cocaine, but does not typically lead to agranulocytosis. Phencyclidine has not been associated with hematologic adverse effects, and intravenous abuse of oxymorphone extended release can lead to a thrombotic microangiopathy."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for the  patient’s clinical findings",C,"Copper deficiency can lead to a demyelinating myelopa thy resembling that of B12 deficiency. Hematologic com plications of copper deficiency include neutropenia and anemia (either microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic). Bone marrow examination can mimic myelodysplastic syndrome with vacuolated cytoplasm of erythroid pre cursors as well as ringed sideroblasts. Gastric bypass surgery is a risk factor for the development of copper deficiency. In a case series of 136 patients with gastric bypass surgery, 9.6% had hypocupremia. Two other case series of 64 and 141 bariatric surgery patients reported substantial hypocupremia in 23% at 6 months and 70% at 3 years, respectively, and a progressive reduction in average serum copper concentrations over 5 years. B12 deficiency does not cause neutropenia to this degree, and the measured B12 level does not support a diagnosis of B12 deficiency. While patients after bariatric surgery can develop deficiencies of other trace elements, such as selenium, chromium, and zinc, none of these produce the constellation of neurologic and hematologic findings in this patient."
"0, ALC 300 × 109/L       Methimazole is stopped, and the patient is treated with  antibiotics and G-CSF.        In addition to continuing her propranolol, which of the  following is the best option to treat her hyperthyroidism  at this point",E,"Agranulocytosis is the most feared side effect of antithy roid drug therapy. In the largest series, agranulocytosis occurred in 0.35% receiving methimazole. Development of agranulocytosis may be dose related and is less com mon when methimazole is started at 15 mg tid or less. It is important to note that agranulocytosis can develop after a prior uneventful course of drug therapy, a finding that is important since renewed exposure to the drug fre quently occurs when patients have a relapse and undergo a second course of antithyroid therapy. The mechanism of agranulocytosis is development of antineutrophil an tibodies, and patients may not be rechallenged with the same drug once their counts recover. Moreover, cross reactivity between propylthiouracil and methimazole for agranulocytosis has been well documented, so the use of the alternative antithyroid drug is contraindicated."

What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient",C,"T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia is a rare dis order characterized by expansion of a population of cells expressing the markers CD3, CD8, and CD57. It can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis and splenomegaly, as well as neutropenia. Treatment usually relies on im munosuppression, and methotrexate or cyclosporine are the preferred agents. The use of weekly methotrexate is recommended over cyclosporine as initial treatment for Felty syndrome, which is the triad of splenomegaly, rheumatoid arthritis, and neutropenia. Cyclosporine may also be used, but may also be more toxic. Use of other lymphocytotoxic agents is not recommended as first line therapy."

This is characteristic of Histo plasma capsulatum. These findings may also be seen on a Wright Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear. TB, cryp tococcus, and coccidiomycosis may be seen on examina tion for the bone marrow but typically need special stains to be visualized."
"2 g/dL Platelets 346,000 × 109/L     Monitoring of the CBC over the next month shows a vac - illating pattern in the neutrophil count.       Which of the following is the best management",A,"This patient has cyclic neutropenia, which is likely pre sent since childhood given the history of gingival dis ease in childhood. G CSF given just prior to the antici pated lowest days in the neutropenic cycle can limit the number of days of profound neutropenia and improve gingival symptoms. G CSF does not need to be admin istered continuously, because, due to the cyclic nature of the condition, she will have normal or near normal neutrophil counts for much of the cycle. Antibiotic prophylaxis could be considered in cases with a history of severe infection; however, it would not be expected to be helpful in the case of gingival disease, and chronic antibiotic therapy is not without its risk. Methotrexate could be considered in the adult form of cyclic neutro penia, which is caused by large granular leukemia, but not in congenital forms, which are caused by genetic mutations."

Urine toxicology is positive for cocaine. Neutropenia is relat - ed to levamisole contamination of the cocaine is suspected.        How long after ceasing levamisole is neutrophil recovery  expected",B,"Levamisole adulteration of cocaine is prevalent within the United States. Levamisole contamination can lead to agranulocytosis or vasculitis. Typically, the neutrophil count will recover within 5–10 days after cessation of levamisole exposure and G CSF administration is not necessary."
17 ).       Which of the following genes is expected to be mutated,A,"Chediak Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that generally presents in childhood with partial oculocutaneous albinism with affected persons have a pe culiar silver sheen to their hair. It is characterized by re current pyogenic infections, mild mucocutaneous bleed ing diathesis, and progressive neurologic deficits. The pathognomonic finding in Chediak Higashi syndrome is the finding of giant inclusions in polymorphonuclear neutrophils on peripheral blood smear seen using rou tine staining techniques. In approximately 90% of cases a LYST (lysosomal trafficking) gene mutation is present, and this is presently the only gene known to be associated with the disease. HPS1 and HPS3 are mutations associated with Her mansky Pudlak syndrome. While HPS is character ized by oculocutaneous albinism with mucocutaneous bleeding associated with the absence of platelet dense granules, giant neutrophil inclusions are not associated with HPS. Mutations in the HPS3 gene are found in about 25% of affected people from Puerto Rico and in approximately 20% of affected individuals from other areas. MYH9 gene defects characterize a group of macrothrom bocytopenias, which is not present in this case."
T-cell gene rearrangement  studies are positive. EBER-ISH is negative. Further stud - ies include negative,A,"T cell large granular leukemia is a clonal disorder of large granular lymphocytes, which often results in neutrope nia. Some cases may be found on evaluation for recur rent bacterial infections and fever, others incidentally due to evaluation of neutropenia. T LGL is often associated with an underlying rheumatologic disorder, especially rheumatoid arthritis. The diagnosis is usually made on Hematopoietic System Disorders 348 the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings from peripheral blood, with the presence of clonal LGLs of T cell lineage. In general, treatment is recommended for those with ANC 0.5 × 10*9/L, constitutional symptoms, treatment of accompanying rheumatologic disorder, or recurrent in fections. Front line treatment is typically low dose meth otrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine."
Which of the following patients would be expected to  have the lowest free thrombopoietin levels,D,"Unlike erythropoietin production, which is regulated by increased gene transcription induced by hypoxia, thrombopoietin (TPO) production by the liver is static and not regulated. Platelets and megakaryocytes have high affinity TPO receptors that bind and internalize TPO. Thus the platelet mass negatively regulates free TPO levels. Additionally, patients with viral hepatitis and cirrhosis have TPO levels that are low. Moreover, patients with thrombocytopenia due to splenic se questration have a large platelet mass in the spleen, which, unfortunately, are quite capable of binding and internalizing TPO, and thus the lowest TPO levels are found in patients with thrombocytopenia due to hepa titis C cirrhosis and splenomegaly. Patients with ITP also have TPO levels that are lower than expected, but other thrombocytopenic disorders are associated with elevated TPO levels."
Which of the following represents the correct order of  erythroid development,C,"It is important to know the normal stages of erythroid development to properly interpret bone marrow as pirates done for purposes of identifying the cause of an unexplained anemia. The earliest identifiable red cell precursor is the pronormoblast, characterized by a deeply basophilic cytoplasm and a large N:C ratio. The nucleus starts to condense, but the cytoplasm re mains basophilic in the basophilic erythroblast, then as the cytoplasm becomes more hemoglobinized, the cell becomes a polychromatophilic erythroblast, then finally a normoblast once the cytoplasm is fully pink/ red. Once the cell extrudes it nucleus, it becomes a re ticulocyte."
Which of the following is most important for committing  primitive multipotent progenitors to the erythroid–mega - karyocyte pathway,A,"Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into common myeloid progenitor cells, but their commit ment to the erythroid megakaryocyte pathway relies on the action of GATA 1, GATA 2, and FOG 1. GATA 1 then plays a role in later megakaryocyte development as well. Gata1 knockout mice show erythroid maturation arrest at the proerythroblast stage and severe anemia, as well as megakaryocyte maturation defects with a pro liferation of low ploidy cells and the formation of large hypogranulated platelets. Runx1 is a transcription factor whose loss leads to familial thrombocytopenia and a ten dency toward the development of myeloid leukemia. It does not appear to be necessary for erythropoiesis. TPO plays a critical role in erythropoiesis and maintenance of the primitive stem cell niche, but it does not act to commit the multipotent stem cell to the erythroid mega karyocyte pathway. NF E2 is essential for the final differ entiation of megakaryocytes and for platelet formation, and NF E2 null mice are thrombocytopenic but have abundant immature megakaryocytes. MYH9 encodes the heavy chain of myosin IIA, which is active in the or ganization of the demarcation membrane system and in proplatelet formation."
Which of the following is most responsible for the throm - bocytosis,C,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition, leading to thrombocytosis in its active state. Interleu kin 6 is the major cytokine driving the inflammation in RA, and is a megakaryocytic differentiating factor, leading to platelet production in vivo. This cytokine is associated with reactive thrombocytosis in a number of conditions, and is the major cytokine associated with the thrombocytosis seen in RA. IL 3 leads to prolifera tion of immature megakaryocytes, not platelets. IL 11 and TPO are required for platelet production, but its role in RA is less well defined. The stem cell factor is needed for the early stages of megakaryocytopoiesis, but does not appear to play a major role in inflamma tory conditions."
Which of the following represents the correct order of  maturation of the myeloid progenitor cells,C,"The earliest identifiable myeloid cell in the bone mar row is the myeloblast, characterized by a large N:C ratio and open chromatin. The promyelocyte stage is next and shows development of a few dark azurophilic granules in the slightly more abundant cytoplasm. These granules become more abundant, as does the cytoplasm; the nu cleus starts to move to one end of the cell, and there is a perinuclear clear area known poetically as the “dawn of neutrophilia,” which represents the Golgi apparatus. The metamyelocyte is characterized by a kidney bean shaped nucleus that becomes more elongated as it develops into a band form."
Which three cytokines are critical for stimulation of bone  marrow production of eosinophils,C,"Hematopoietic progenitors differentiate upon exposure to a network of cytokines and chemokines to become committed to the eosinophil/basophil (Eo/B) lineage. Transcription factors, including GATA 1PU.1, and C/ EBP members regulate the production of eosinophils in the bone marrow. Cytokines and chemokines are generated under appropriate stimulation from T cells in the bone marrow. The three key cytokines that are critical for stimulation of bone marrow production of eosinophils are IL 3, IL 5, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM CSF). Though other cy tokines such as IL 4, IL 6, IL 11, IL 12, SCF also play a role in eosinophil genesis. IFN gamma prolongs eosino phil survival but is not necessary for synthesis."

In the setting of gastric bypass (in which trace nutrients may not be adequately absorbed) and cou pled with the presence of vacuolated erythroids (pictured) in the bone marrow as well as normal cytogenetics, a mi cronutrient deficiency is suspected. In this case, the copper deficiency may be due to malabsorption with the gastric bypass or zinc toxicity (from zinc lozenges and zinc con taining denture paste). Decreasing zinc intake and supple menting copper should result in improvement in periph eral counts in approximately 6 weeks. Though there is a monoclonal IgG kappa present by se rum immunofixation, there are no other diagnostic crite ria for multiple myeloma, and there are no excess plasma cells identified in the bone marrow. Zinc deficiency would manifest as diarrhea, skin disor ders, disturbed olfaction, and predisposition to infection."

In a patient with hemophilia B, factor IX concentrates would be the treatment of choice for a life threatening bleed (answer C). The volume of FFP to reverse a markedly elevated INR in a patient with severe CHF would likely be prohibitive and one of the prothrombin complex concentrates, such as KCentra, would be a better choice (answer D).

Up to 40% of these individuals develop anti IgA antibodies. When such patients are ex posed to IgA during a blood transfusion, they are at risk of anaphylaxis due to a reaction between recipient antibodies and donor IgA in the transfused donor blood product. The risk of anaphylaxis is highest with fresh frozen plasma, but it may also occur with transfusion of cellular products, as variable amounts of plasma are found in these products. Washing of red blood cells to remove plasma products can greatly reduce this risk, but it was not listed as a choice. As FFP is not a cellular product, washing is not a viable option (answer E). Plasma can be obtained, however, from an IgA deficient donor to minimize the risk of anaphylaxis (answer C). Irradiation of donor red cells (answer A) is indicated in severely immunocompromised recipients to decrease the risk of transfusion associated graft versus host disease. Leukoreduction (answer B) is standard practice at many blood centers and decreases the incidence of transfusion associated febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions and cytomegalovirus (CMV) transmission, but it would not prevent anaphylaxis or allergic type transfusion reac tions.

The patient in this vignette developed fever, dysp nea, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxia during a red blood cell transfusion. This presentation is very con sistent with TRALI, a reaction secondary to antileukocyte antibodies in donor plasma directed against recipient leu kocytes, which subsequently sequester in the lungs, typi cally during or within 6 hours of a transfusion (answer D). TRALI can occur with any blood product, even erythro cytes and platelets, which often contain small amounts of plasma. Treatment of TRALI is primarily supportive, and most patients fully recover within days or a week. Defer ral of multiparous females from donation of plasma has decreased the incidence of TRALI. TRALI can be difficult to distinguish from transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO). However, this pa tient, because she had received only a single unit of packed erythrocytes, had no underlying cardiac disease, and had no jugular venous distention, S 3 or peripheral edema was unlikely to develop fluid overload (answer E). An AHTR is most commonly caused by a human error leading to ABO incompatibility. Very early in the transfu sion, an affected patient develops hypotension and often disseminated intravascular coagulation, but this patient is normotensive and presented primarily with hypoxia after the transfusion was complete making an AHTR unlikely (answer A). The development of a new alloantibody may lead to a DHTR several days after the transfusion, leading to worsening anemia, but would not be compatible with the case presented (answer B).

Her worsen ing anemia and severe pain crisis occurring 5–10 days after receiving a transfusion is classic for a DHTR in a patient with sickle cell anemia. Her clinical course, including jaun dice, an elevated indirect bilirubin level, and a hemoglobin level lower than her post transfusion value, combined with a type and screen demonstrating the presence of a new al loantibody, would be diagnostic of a DHTR.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in  management",E,"This case a represents what has been described as “hyper hemolysis” in a patient with sickle cell anemia, wherein the transfused red cells are rapidly hemolyzed, in ad dition to the patient’s own red cells, leading to critically low hemoglobin. Continuing folate is always indicated in patients with hemolysis. While the exact mechanisms still remain unknown, the use of IVIg is commonly employed, along with corticosteroid use. Although patients with hy perhemolysis may not have developed a new allo or au toantibody to red cells, this has been noted and is prudent prior to any additional blood product exposure. As she is a hospitalized patient, with hemolysis, and receiving IVIg, it is reasonable to ensure thromboprophylaxis."
4).       Which of the following is the most appropriate next step,D,"The patient’s history and laboratory findings are consist ent with a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction several days after transfusion. This is characterized by an anam nestic response to a minor blood group antigen from a prior transfusion or pregnancy. A repeat type and screen and/or a direct Coombs will now show the presence of the alloantibody. Thin and thick smears are useful for the presence of malaria, which is not consistent with this case. Similarly, there is no reason to suspect bacterial infection as the cause for her hemolysis. Given the hemolysis, it would not be prudent to either proceed with surgery or transfuse further red cells."
"An 84-year-old man with refractory anemia with excess  blasts-2 (RAEB-2) is not considered to be a candidate for  high-intensity chemotherapy. Following one cycle of a  hypomethylating agent, he has declined any additional  therapy with chemotherapy, deciding upon supportive  care alone. During the course of his treatment, he has  been treated with recombinant erythropoietin, although  this has become less effective. As a result, he has received  2 units of packed red cells every month week for the 14  months in order to ameliorate his symptoms of dyspnea  and fatigue.     Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in  management",B,"As the patient has received more than 25 units of packed red cells, there is a near certainty of iron overload, which is an expected complication of repeated blood transfusions. It is recommended that patients with MDS who have re ceived more than 20 units of packed red cells be considered for chelation therapy. Use of another erythropoiesis agent is not expected to be beneficial, and the use of thrombopoi etin reception agonists is not approved for use in MDS."
"8, and due to the emergent nature of  his case, he is given 4 units of fresh frozen plasma along  with 10 mg IV of vitamin K. Following the completion of  his second unit and during infusion of the third unit, he  develops the sudden onset of dyspnea and is noted to be  markedly hypoxic, despite the use of supplemental oxy - gen. No evidence for volume overload or chest wall pete - chiae is noted on physical examination, whereas a STAT  chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates.     Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in  management",D,"The rapid onset of symptoms, hypoxia, and infiltrates fol lowing the receipt of plasma is consistent with TRALI. Therefore, the infusion must be stopped and the blood bank alerted immediately. Aggressive supportive care is indicated, including intubation and mechanical ventila tion, if required. There is no role for the use of IVIg in the treatment of TRALI. While there is the chance for a pulmonary embolism, ei ther from a thrombus or from bone marrow infarction, this is not supported by the physical examination. There is no approved indication for the use of rFVIIa in the reversal of warfarin, particularly if four factor prothrombin complex concentrates are available."
9 (35–45) MCV 87 Platelets 3 (150–450)     Review of the peripheral smear shows no schistocytes or  platelet clumping.     Which of the following should be performed to correctly  diagnose her thrombocytopenia,A,"The sudden drop in the platelet count several days after transfusion in a multiparous patient that is associated with bleeding symptoms is consistent with posttransfusion purpura. This is associated with the development of an al loantibody to one of the human platelet antigens (HPA), most oftentimes HPA 1A, although numerous other types ( 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, etc.) have also been described. Treat ment consists of intravenous immunoglobulin. Although the patient is on enoxaparin, which can be associ ated with HIT, the marked thrombocytopenia and hemor rhagic manifestations are inconsistent with this diagnosis, raising the chance that checking a heparin/PF4 ELISA and/ or SRA might lead to an incorrect diagnosis. Neither CMV viremia nor drug induced thrombocytopenia is consistent with the case. Proton pump inhibitors are unlikely to cause this presentation."
6)     Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in  management,B,"Units of red cells and plasma are stored in a citrate contain ing solution, which chelates calcium, preventing coagula tion. With large enough volumes of either blood products, the plasma level of calcium falls, leading to symptomatic hypocalcemia. This is a common side effect of apheresis involving red cells or plasma, and is readily treated with calcium supplementation. Although the platelet count has not returned to normal (i.e., >150), it is still early in the disease course and has increased. Increasing the intensity of therapy or immune suppression at this time is not indicated. While patients with TTP are susceptible to CNS damage from their micro angiopathy, her symptoms are consistent with hypocalce mia and does not warrant imaging."
"A 63-year-old woman with MDS developed worsening cy - topenias with increasing blast count. She has no siblings  that could serve as a matched related donor. While await - ing the search results for an unrelated donor, the patient  has become transfusion-dependent.     However, her red cell transfusions have become compli - cated by repeated episodes of fevers and chills. Multiple  times her transfusions have been stopped, and a workup  by the blood bank has shown no hemolysis, infections, or  mismatch as the cause for her symptoms. Invariably, her  symptoms resolve in less than an hour after stopping the  transfusion.       Which of the following may help prevent her from experi - encing this reaction again",D,"This case represents episodes of febrile nonhemolytic re actions, which may be reduced or prevented by the use of leukoreduced blood, although good data are lacking to support this practice. Since there is not an allergic reaction or hemolytic, there is no role for the use of steroids or anti histamines. As the patient is not immunosuppressed, there is no need for irradiated red cells."
5) AST 145 (15–41) ALT 226 (17–63) Alkaline phosphatase 85     Skin biopsy shows satellite dyskeratosis.       Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis,D,"The constellation of fevers, diffuse erythematous rash, pan cytopenia, and transaminitis are suggestive of this process, particularly as the patient was not noted to have received ir radiated red cells with his transfusion. The skin biopsy find ing of dyskeratosis and satellitosis is diagnostic. Tacrolimus is not known to cause photosensitivity reactions, with GVHD not being associated with pancytopenia. CMV reactivation would not be expected to cause a diffuse erythematous rash."
"A 43-year-old man with asthma, recurrent sinus infec - tions, and eczema has been brought in by EMS follow - ing a fall off a ladder while hanging Christmas lights. An  ultrasound examination of his abdomen shows a large  fluid collection in the abdominal musculature, consistent  with a hematoma. He is noted to have bled at least 4 units  and is given 2 units of packed red cells. Within minutes  of receiving the blood, the patient becomes hypotensive,  tachycardic, tachypneic, with stridor and wheezing not - ed. The transfusion is stopped, sent to the blood bank,  and he is treated emergently with epinephrine, followed  by high-dose steroids, antihistamines, and H2-receptor  blockade.     Which of the following is the most appropriate next step",B,"The history of recurrent infections, asthma, and atopy is consistent with a patient who may have IgA deficiency. While not occurring in the majority of patients with IgA deficiency, anaphylaxis to blood products can occur. As this case does not represent a DHTR, a DAT and T&S will not be useful. The symptoms are not consistent with a transfusion of mismatched red cells."
"A 39-year-old patient with ulcerative colitis has been ad - mitted for an acute flare and symptomatic anemia. She is  treated with high-dose methylprednisolone, intravenous  fluids, and is transfused 2 units of packed red cells. Five  minutes into the transfusion, she summons the nurse for  rapidly progressive left arm pain and chills. Aside from  an increased temperature, her vital signs remain relatively  stable.     Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis",A,"The development of sudden arm pain, fevers, with or with out flank pain is consistent with an AHTR, when the wrong blood is transfused to the wrong patient. Treatment includes the immediate cessation of the transfusion, sending all blood and components to the blood bank, hydration, and Transfusion Medicine 367 supportive care. The absence of respiratory findings or hy potension/tachycardia makes this inconsistent with anaphy laxis. Bacterial contamination would be expected to produce vital sign changes. The absence of respiratory symptoms makes TRALI unlikely."
"A 28-year-old man with sickle cell disease, complicated  by avascular necrosis, pigment cholelithiasis, and recur - rent pain crises is routinely treated locally with opioid an - algesics, intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and 1–2 units of  packed red cells. The patient is now being transferred to  another institution because of an inability to provide cross - matched red cells.     Upon arrival to the ER, the patient is noted to be an adult  African American man in moderate distress. He is icteric  and splinting his left shoulder, but otherwise there are no  other pertinent exam findings. Among the usual labs that Transfusion Medicine 362 are drawn in the ER, a T&S is performed and shows the  following",B,"Unfortunately, this case represents a marked alloimmuni zation of a multiply transfused patient. In patients with sickle cell disease, great care must be taken to ensure that there is matching to minor antigens, above the usual pro cess for otherwise unaffected individuals, as severe alloim munization is associated with decreased rates of survival. Acquired B antigen occurs when a patient with type A blood is modified by infection or malignancy, resulting in the appearance of a B blood type. There is no reason to suspect this. Similarly, the negative direct Coombs and presence of an Rh antigen makes autoimmunity and the McLeod phenotype, respectively, incorrect."
"9% (35–45) MCV 104/L (80–98) Platelets 18,000 × 109/L (150–450)     Which of the following is the next best step in management",B,"In a multiply transfused patient, the presence of HLA antibodies can lead to platelet refractoriness, which could have been avoided with the use of leukodepleted prod ucts. There is no evidence of hemolysis, which would make checking a DAT pointless. While patients may have platelet antibodies, there is no reason to suspect PTP or transfuse HPA matched platelets."
4 (39–49) MCV 83 Platelets 124 (150–450)     Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in  management,C,"His case is consistent with transfusion associated babesiosis, which is becoming a growing issue in endemic areas. His visit to a classically endemic area of babesiosis and findings on the peripheral smear are typical for his presentation. There is no liver involvement or travel to areas endemic for malaria, making hepatitis or malaria unreasonable. Macroscopic ag glutination with acute and convalescent sera is for the diag nosis of leptospirosis, which is not consistent with this case."
"A 57-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes melli - tus, chronic kidney disease (stage III), ischemic cardio - myopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%, and atrial  fibrillation is maintained on therapeutic anticoagulation  with rivaroxaban. He has required increasing diuretic  use to control his peripheral edema, resulting in peri - odic episodes of worsening renal function. He develops  symptoms of profound light-headedness and dizziness  and is brought to the ER, where he is noted to have a  4-unit drop in his hemoglobin compared with a CBC  performed 4 weeks prior. While in the trauma bay, he is  noted to have a large melenic bowel movement. A mas - sive transfusion protocol is initiated, which includes an  equal amount of fresh frozen plasma to counteract the  effects of anticoagulation. He is resuscitated and trans - ferred to the MICU, where he is later noted to suddenly  be hypoxic, tachypneic, dyspneic, and orthopneic. The  patient is emergently intubated, and the portable chest  x-ray to evaluate the position of his endotracheal tube  shows diffuse opacities consistent with marked pulmo - nary edema.     Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis",D,"The patient’s decompensation is consistent with TACO, given the findings of his sudden respiratory decompensa tion, findings on chest x ray, and symptoms of heart fail ure. There is no mention of central venous catheterization to account for an air embolism. Likewise, the history is not consistent with anaphylaxis, and no mention is made of either blood in the endotracheal tube or an alveolar pattern on chest x ray. Finally, TRALI is typically associated with fevers and absence of heart failure symptoms."
"In the case of question 31, while the patient above is under - going attempts at correcting his respiratory compromise,  an EKG is performed to evaluate for myocardial injury.  This is significant for showing the presence of peaked T- waves and shortened QT interval. Which of the following  is the cause of his EKG changes",A,"This patient is a prime example of who is most likely to sustain this complication of transfusion. The receipt of multiple blood products, the volume of said transfusions, and the impaired renal function are all risk factors for transfusion associated hyperkalemia. Hypocalcemia, ei ther from the effects of citrate or from severe hypomagne semia, would lead to a prolonged QT interval. There is no reason to suspect iron overload after this event."
"5°C following her qAM platelet trans - fusion. She is “pan-cultured,” started on cefepime, when  her blood cultures show the presence of coagulase nega - tive staphylococcus.     Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis",A,"Bacterial infection of platelet transfusions is the most com mon infectious complication of blood product transfusion. Internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis, while classically associated with Fusarium infections, would not be expect ed following the initiation of anticoagulation. Given the temporal relation with the platelet transfusion, a catheter associated infection is less likely. Her symptoms, including the culture results, are not consistent with a transfusion re action."
"A 48-year-old man has been diagnosed with fistulizing  Crohn disease, which is now controlled with a mainte - nance regimen of infliximab, allowing him to resume his  work as the regional sales manager for his corporation.  During a business trip to Florida, he had another flare  of his inflammatory bowel disease and was hospitalized,  where he received 2 units of packed red cells, intravenous  methylprednisolone, and antibiotics. He improved and  was discharged home a week later.     He returned home, when about 2 weeks later he developed  progressive chest pain, dyspnea, and orthopnea. EMS is  summoned, and he is brought to the ER, where an EKG  shows diffuse ST-segment elevation with depression of the  PR interval. Despite serial cardiac enzymes being negative,  he is taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where no  flow-limiting coronary disease is noted. A ventriculogram  shows a left-ventricle ejection fraction of 25%. A bedside  echocardiogram confirms this finding and shows a peri - cardial effusion.       What is the most likely cause for his presentation",A,"Chagas disease can be spread via blood transfusion, with donors in Florida having the highest seroprevalence rate. In immunocompromised patients, the acute phase of in fections with T. cruzi can present with heart failure type symptoms and a myopericarditis. Aortic dissection would have been detected during his catheterization, and there was no myocardial infarction for Dressler syndrome. While SLE can manifest with a serositis, there are no other reasons to suspect this."
1  g/dL. A STAT head CT shows no bleed and a MRI reveals  no infarction.     Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis,C,"Patients with sickling disorders may be at risk for hy perviscosity with their hemoglobin levels are elevated, particularly if transfused to greater than 12 g/dL. The lethargy, malaise, and headache are caused by the effects of transfusion, and in a case such as this, phlebotomy is required. Given the negative findings on his neurologic imaging, there is no support for the diagnoses of either a stroke, generally or from a paradoxical embolism. Diphenhy dramine toxicity would present with anticholinergic symptoms and would not be expected from the usual premedication dosing."
"A 38-year-old man has a past medical history of sickle  cell disease, complicated by recurrent episodes of acute  chest and priapism, along with hypertension and diabe - tes, which is controlled with the use of enalapril, along  with diet and exercise. He has been admitted for chest  pain that has worsened despite the use of his narcotics at  home. On presentation to the ER, he is noted to be tachyp - neic, tachycardic, and hypoxic on room air. A chest x-ray  is remarkable for new bilateral lower lobe opacities. He  is pan-cultured in the ER; started on vancomycin, pipera - cillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin; and admitted to the  Medicine service. It is felt that he is having a recurrent epi - sode of acute chest, and he is prepared for an emergent red  cell exchange, using phenotypically matched red cells via  the blood bank’s sickle cell protocol. A VasCath is placed  in the right femoral vein under ultrasound guidance, and  when the appropriate amount of blood has been obtained  and released by the blood bank, erythrocytapheresis com - mences.     After the third unit of blood has completed, Mr. Williams  is noted to be flushed, stridorous, and hypotensive, where - in he also notes abdominal cramping with an immediate  need to have a bowel movement. The procedure is imme - diately halted, with a resolution of his symptoms within  2 hours. Laboratory testing shows no hemolysis or renal  impairment.       Which of the following is the most likely cause for his event:  ",A,"The presence of an ACE inhibitor during therapeutic apheresis can cause a number of reactions, as noted in the case. This is due to the increased amount of bradykinin that is generated by the passage of the patient’s blood over the nega tively charged surface of the apheresis circuit, which cannot be effectively degraded due to the inhibition of ACE. While anaphylaxis shares similar symptoms, these symp toms are more consistent with that from the ACE inhibi tion. The absence of groin pain and/or hemolysis rules out a mismatch, and a simple transfusion reaction is associated with mild fevers. BIBLIOGRAPHY"
"A 57-year-old woman with known metastatic breast can - cer involving multiple thoracic vertebrae presents to the  emergency department complaining of severe back pain.  Her pain has increased over the last 3–4 days and is no  longer responsive to oral acetaminophen. The pain is cur - rently 9/10, does not radiate, and is worse with movement.  She denies weakness or loss of sensation in her trunk, peri - neum, or lower extremities. She further denies urinary or  fecal incontinence. On physical exam, she has full strength and a normal  sensory exam in all extremities. Serum electrolytes and  creatinine are normal. Spinal magnetic resonance imag - ing (MRI) reveals progression of T4–6 vertebral metastases  without evidence of epidural extension.

What is the next  most appropriate step in her management",B,"This patient is suffering from somatic pain related to ver tebral metastases. According to NCCN Adult Cancer Pain Guidelines, if severe pain is unchanged 15 minutes after the initial intravenous bolus of morphine or other opioid, escalation by 50%–100% is appropriate.

You are concerned about continuing to give mor - phine given her renal function. Which is the most appropri - ate next order",B,"This patient is in pain crisis due to progression of her liv er metastases. Since this patient will likely require rapid escalation of opioid, the safest management would be to avoid morphine, which relies heavily on renal clearance of active metabolites. Since morphine 5 mg IV was effective, an equianalgesic dose of another opioid would be appro priate. Hydromorphone 0.75 mg and fentanyl 50 μg (an swer B) are equianalgesic in this case."

This scale includes age 16–45 (answer E) and person al or family history of alcohol, illicit drug (C), or prescrip tion drug abuse. Of note, tobacco abuse is not a risk factor on this scale. Several psychiatric diagnoses including ADD do increase risk of opioid misuse (D). In women, preado lescent sexual abuse also increases this risk and should be part of your routine assessment when prescribing opioids. Patients at higher risk for opioid misuse may require pain specialist referral."

Due to concerns about his evolving diabetic ne - phropathy, he was rotated off of his home morphine regimen  to a fentanyl PCA and is currently on a basal rate of 100 μg/h  with demand doses of 50 μg and a 10-minute lockout. He reports excellent pain controlled with no adverse ef - fects from his current PC",B,"The conversion of IV to transdermal fentanyl in this pa tient is 1:1. No dose increase or reduction is necessary if he is reporting good pain control without adverse effects. It is safest to avoid morphine (answer D) in this patient, as morphine relies heavily on renal clearance. Palliative medicine consultation (E) is not necessary in this case, as the patient’s pain is controlled with his current PCA."
"A 52-year-old male with AML who completed an alloge - neic stem cell transplant from a matched, unrelated donor  2 months ago. His hospitalization course was complicated  by herpes zoster along the T4 dermatome on the left. Al - though his rash completely resolved, he continues to de - scribe 5/10 burning pain at that site, which has improved  from 9/10 prior to starting gabapentin, which is now at  1200 mg q8h. He expresses a desire for improved pain control but  says “I’m already taking too many pills.” What is the next best step in management",B,"Gabapentin, already at maximum dose, (answer A) has shown some benefit in this patient’s pain, but he is re questing additional pain relief without additional pill bur den (C). Lidocaine patch has been shown to provide relief for postherpetic neuralgia compared with placebo. There is no role for diphenhydramine or additional imaging for postherpetic neuralgia (D and E)."
"A 32-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy calls your clinic with a  complaint of ongoing pain in her low back, both hips, and  thighs. Labs 3 days ago were significant for severe neutro - penia, and she received pegfilgrastim at that time. She was  seen yesterday and started on naproxen for pain that has  provided only partial relief. She denies tingling, numbness, or weakness in the  lower extremities and has not lost bowel or bladder con - trol. Lower extremity strength, sensation, and reflexes are  within normal limits. What is the next best step in management",D,"While NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first line therapy for bone pain secondary to colony stimulating factors such as pegfilgrastim, there is no evidence for superiority of any single agent over another (answers A and B). How ever, there is evidence of benefit for opioids. MRI would not be indicated with signs or symptoms of neurological dysfunction. Topical lidocaine will not help treat this pain."
8 mg/dL. What is the next most appropriate step in management,D,"This patient has severe respiratory depression in the setting of rapid titration of morphine and acute renal insufficiency. Morphine is glucuronidated in the liver to active metabo lites that are renally cleared, and using an agent such as fentanyl that does not dependent on renal function would have been safer in this situation. Transfer to ICU (answer B) may be required but is not the next step as this patient Pain Control and End of Life 374 needs urgent opioid reversal. Administering naloxone 0.08 mg is the most appropriate initial dose. Naloxone 0.4 mg (answer C) would only be given in the case of cardiopul monary arrest. Outside of this setting, high dose naloxone would likely precipitate acute pain and possibly acute opi oid withdrawal in an opioid tolerant patient. Other workup including ABG and blood cultures (A and E) would be low er priority because of the likelihood of opioid intoxication."
"An 82-year-old former attorney with metastatic pancreatic  adenocarcinoma who presents to your clinic accompanied  by his wife for follow-up. He recently had progression of  disease after completing FOLFIRINOX, and he reports  worsening fatigue and malaise over the last week. His wife  reports that he spends most of his day in bed, eats very  little, and needs assistance to get to the bathroom 10 feet  away. You discuss a plan to forgo further chemotherapy based  on his poor performance status and introduce a plan to in - crease his medical support at home by introducing hospice  care. Which of the follow is true about hospice enrollment",C,"Medicare guidelines for hospice eligibility require a physi cian’s certification of a “life expectancy of 6 months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course.” This determi nation can be made based on decline in clinical status (e.g., significant weight loss, intractable symptoms, and decline in performance status) or poor baseline function combined with disease specific criteria (e.g., metastatic cancer, end stage liver disease). This patient’s poor performance status and metastatic pancreatic cancer are sufficient for hospice enrollment. Hospice care is often performed at home (an swer E). In addition to some in home support, 24 hour phone support is common. Patients can continue to be en rolled in hospice indefinitely as long as they continue to meet criteria for hospice (A); and a DNR code status is not legally required (B), although some institutions may require it. While hospice can help patients avoid unwanted hospi tal admission, they are allowed to terminate hospice enroll ment to present to an acute hospital if they wish."
"A 76-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer you  have followed for several years in your clinic. She was  discharged 3 weeks ago after a week in hospital for pneu - monia.

She is now being readmit - ted to the hospital for extreme fatigue and acutely altered  mentation. Your inpatient team schedules a meeting with the pa - tient’s children. The patient cannot participate in the meet - ing due to altered mentation. You feel that due to her very poor performance status and  acute medical condition that further cancer therapy would  pose more risk than potential benefit, and you think addi - tional medical support from a hospice service at home would  help preserve the patient’s wish to avoid hospitalization. In presenting this news to her children, which of the  following techniques would not be appropriate to include  in your family meeting",C,"Discussing serious news about a very sick patient can be challenging, and it is important to have a routine for these discussions. One commonly used mnemonic is SPIKES: Setting, Patient/Family Perception, Invitation, Giving Knowledge, Empathy, Summarize. Conducting meetings in a private, comfortable setting with proper introduction of meeting participants and acknowledgment of potential interruptions (e.g., pagers) is very important but some times overlooked when discussing serious news. In cases such as this where the patient’s mental status prevents her participation in the meeting, it may be easiest and best to conduct the meeting in a separate conference room or oth er quiet space."
"A 77-year-old female patient of yours with severe COPD  and widely metastatic NSCLC presented to hospital 4 days  ago with dyspnea and fevers and was found to have pneu - monia and significant progression of disease in her lungs  with slight bilateral pleural effusions. Despite appropriate antibiotic, steroid, and inhaler man - agement, she continues to require high-flow nasal cannula  at 40 L/min and chest x-ray has slightly worsened. She pre - viously stated that she would never want mechanical venti - lation, and this was appropriately documented. She has no  pain. The patient becomes increasingly confused and starts  moaning but maintains a normal respiratory rate with un - changed O2 saturation. pCO2 is 90 mm Hg increased from  75 mm Hg yesterday. The family is worried she is in pain.What is the most appropriate action",C,"This likely represents terminal delirium, a natural part of the dying process. Since she has no history of pain, it is unlikely that this is the reason for her current presentation. Also, although opioids are appropriate to control dyspnea at end of life, this patient’s respiratory rate and O 2 satura tion are normal (answers A and B). Her wishes to avoid in tubation should be honored (D). Although it is important to reevaluate and limit nonessential medications at end of life, stopping certain home medications can also lead to withdrawal and increase risk of delirium (E)."

Some clinicians who are less familiar with hos pice may unintentionally convey that hospice will provide continuous nursing care, leading to patient mistrust and frustration when this expectation is not met. Around the clock nursing care, if available, will often come at an ad ditional cost to the patient."

Using euphemisms such as “do everything” or “pass away” (answers B and D) can lead to misunderstanding and prevent informed decision making. Initially, giving small amounts of infor mation may be easier for the patient to absorb, and it is not necessary to describe mechanistic details of resuscitation.
