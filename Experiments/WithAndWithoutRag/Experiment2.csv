0,"A 39-year-old woman is evaluated for anemia. Her  laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL,  hematocrit of 23.9%, mean corpuscular volume of  72 fL, mean cell hemoglobin of 25 pg, and mean cell  hemoglobin concentration of 28%. The peripheral  smear is shown in Figure 2. Which of the follow- ing tests is most likely to be abnormal in this patient?  A. Ferritin B. Haptoglobin C. Hemoglobin electrophoresis D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase E. Vitamin B12","The answer is A.  (Chap. 2) This patient with anemia demonstrates a low  mean cell volume, low mean cell hemoglobin, and  low mean cell hemoglobin concentration. The periph- eral smear demonstrates microcytic and hypochromic  cells, which would be expected given these laboratory  findings. In addition, there is marked variation in size   Review and Self-Assessment 753 (anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis). These find- ings are consistent with severe iron-deficiency anemia,  and serum ferritin would be expected to be <10 to   15 Î¼g/L. A low haptoglobin level would be seen in cases  of hemolysis, which can be intravascular or extravascu- lar in origin. In intravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would be expected to show poikilocytosis with  the presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells  [RBCs]). In extravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would typically shows spherocytes. Hemoglo- bin electrophoresis is used to determine the presence of  abnormal hemoglobin variants. Sickle cell anemia is the  most common form and demonstrates sickled RBCs.  Thalassemias are also common inherited hemoglobinop- athies. The peripheral smear in thalassemia often shows  target cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi- ciency leads to oxidant-induced hemolysis with presence  of bite cells or blister cells. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads  to macrocytosis, which is not consistent with this case.","C. Hemoglobin electrophoresis

This patient likely has a microcytic, hypochromic anemia, which is commonly seen in iron deficiency anemia. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to identify different types of hemoglobin, so it would be the most likely test to be abnormal in this patient with suspected iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin levels would also be expected to be low in iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin electrophoresis would be more specific for confirming the diagnosis.",A. Ferritin
1,"A 62-year-old man is evaluated for anemia. He has a  hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL (normal hemoglobin value,  15 g/dL), hematocrit of 27.0% (normal hemato- crit, 45%), mean cell volume of 88 fL, mean cell  hemoglobin of 28 pg, and mean cell hemoglobin  concentration of 30%. On peripheral blood smear,  polychromatophilic macrocytes are seen. The retic- ulocyte count is 9%. What is the reticulocyte pro- duction index? A. 0.54 B. 1.67 C. 2.7 D. 4.5 E. 5.4","The answer is C.  (Chap. 2) The reticulocyte index and reticulocyte pro- duction index are useful in the evaluation of anemia to  determine the adequacy of bone marrow response to the  anemia. A normal reticulocyte count is 1â€“2%, and in  the presence of anemia, this would be expected to rise  to more than two to three times the normal value (the  reticulocyte index). The reticulocyte index is calculated  as Reticulocyte count Ã— (Patientâ€™s hemoglobin/Normal  hemoglobin). In this case, the reticulocyte index would  be 5.4%. A second correction is further necessary in this  patient given the presence of polychromatophilic mac- rocytes on peripheral smear. This finding indicates pre- mature release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow  (â€œshift cellsâ€), and thus these cells have a longer life span.  It is recommended to further divide the reticulocyte  index by a factor of 2, which is known as the reticulo- cyte production index. In this case, the value would be  2.7%.","The reticulocyte production index (RPI) is calculated using the formula:

RPI = (Patient's reticulocyte count / Normal reticulocyte count) x (Patient's hematocrit / Normal hematocrit)

In this case, the patient's reticulocyte count is 9% and the normal reticulocyte count is typically around 1-2%. The patient's hematocrit is 27% and the normal hematocrit is 45%.

RPI = (9 / 1.5) x (27 / 45) = 6 x 0.6 = 3.6

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed, but the RPI is 3.6.","The reticulocyte production index (RPI) can be calculated using the formula provided in the context information. Based on the given values, the correct calculation for the reticulocyte production index is 2.7."
2,"You are asked to review the peripheral blood smear  from a patient with anemia (Figure 4). Serum lac- tate dehydrogenase is elevated, and there is hemo- globinuria. This patient is likely to have which  physical examination finding?  A. Goiter B. Heme-positive stools C. Mechanical second heart sound D. Splenomegaly E. Thickened calvarium","The answer is C. (Chap. 2) This blood smear shows fragmented red blood  cells (RBCs) of varying size and shape. In the presence  of a foreign body within the circulation (prosthetic heart  valve, vascular graft), RBCs can become destroyed.  Such intravascular hemolysis will also cause serum lactate  dehydrogenase to be elevated and hemoglobinuria. In  isolated extravascular hemolysis, there is no hemoglobin  or hemosiderin released into the urine. The characteris- tic peripheral blood smear in splenomegaly is the pres- ence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants within  red blood cells). Certain diseases are associated with  extramedullary hematopoiesis (e.g., chronic hemolytic  anemias), which can be detected by an enlarged spleen,  thickened calvarium, myelofibrosis, or hepatomegaly.  The peripheral blood smear may show teardrop cells  or nucleated RBCs. Hypothyroidism is associated with  macrocytosis, which is not demonstrated here. Chronic  gastrointestinal blood loss will cause microcytosis, not  schistocytes.","D. Splenomegaly

Splenomegaly is a common physical examination finding in patients with anemia, especially in cases of hemolytic anemia where there is increased destruction of red blood cells. The elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and hemoglobinuria seen in this patient suggest hemolysis, which can lead to splenomegaly as the spleen works to remove the damaged red blood cells from circulation.",D. Splenomegaly
3,All of the following are common manifestations of  bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease EXCEPT: A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel B. Epistaxis C. Menorrhagia D. Postpartum hemorrhage E. Spontaneous hemarthrosis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 3) von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inher- ited disorder of platelet adhesion that has several types.  The most common type is inherited in an autosomal  dominant fashion and is associated with low levels of  qualitatively normal von Willebrand factor. As a disorder  primary hemostasis associated with the development of  a platelet plug, VWD is primarily associated with muco- sal bleeding. General bleeding symptoms that are more  common in VWD include prolonged bleeding after  surgery or dental procedures, menorrhagia, postpartum  hemorrhage, and large bruises. However, easy bruising  and menorrhagia are common complaints and are not  specific for VWD in isolation. Factors that raise concern  for VWD in women with menstrual symptoms include  iron-deficiency anemia, need for blood transfusion, pas- sage of clots >1 inch in diameter, and need to change a  pad or tampon more than hourly. Epistaxis is also a very  common occurrence in the general population, but it is  the most common complaint of males with VWD. Con- cerning features of epistaxis that may be more likely to  indicate an underlying bleeding diathesis are lack of sea- sonal variation and bleeding that requires medical atten- tion. Although most gastrointestinal bleeding in indi- viduals with VWD is unrelated to the bleeding diathesis,  VWD types 2 and 3 are associated with angiodysplasia  of the bowel and gastrointestinal bleeding. Spontane- ous hemarthroses or deep muscle hematomas are seen  in clotting factor deficiencies and not seen VWD except  severe VWD with associated decreased factor VIII levels  <5%.",A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel,A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel
4,"A 68-year-old man is admitted to the intensive  care unit with spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed- ing and hypotension. He has a medical history of  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney  disease stage III. His medications include lisinopril,  amlodipine, sitagliptin, and glimepiride. On initial  presentation, he is in pain and has a blood pressure  of 70/40 mm Hg with a heart rate of 132 beats/ min. His hemoglobin on admission is 5.3 g/dL  and hematocrit is 16.0%. His coagulation studies  demonstrate an aPTT of 64 seconds and a PT of  12.1 seconds (INR 1.0). Mixing studies (1:1) are  performed. Immediately, the aPTT decreases to   42 seconds. At 1 hour, the aPTT is 56 seconds, and  at 2 hours, it is 68 seconds. Thrombin time and  reptilase time are normal. Fibrinogen is also nor- mal. What is the most likely cause of the patientâ€™s  coagulopathy? A. Acquired factor VIII deficiency B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Lupus anticoagulant E. Vitamin K deficiency FIGURE 4 FIGURE 2  Review and Self-Assessment 727","The answer is B.  (Chap. 3) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) measures the integrity of the intrinsic and com- mon coagulation pathways, and as such, is affected by  all of the coagulation factors, except factor VII. The  aPTT reagent contains phospholipids derived from ani- mal or vegetable sources and includes an activator of  the intrinsic coagulation system, such as nonparticulate  ellagic acid or kaolin. The phospholipid reagent fre- quently varies from laboratory to laboratory. Thus, an  aPTT measured in one hospital may differ from another.  Isolated elevations in the aPTT can be related to fac- tor deficiencies, heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors,  lupus anticoagulant, or the presence of a specific fac- tor inhibitor. To differentiate between the presence of  factor deficiencies and inhibitors, mixing studies should  be performed. Mixing studies are performed by mixing  normal plasma and the patientâ€™s plasma in a 1:1 ratio.  The aPTT and prothrombin time (PT) are incubated at   Review and Self-Assessment 754 37oC, and levels are measured immediately and serially  thereafter for about 2 hours. If the cause is an isolated  factor deficiency, the aPTT should correct to normal  values and remain normal throughout the incubation  period. In the presence of an acquired inhibitor, the  aPTT may or may not correct immediately, but upon  incubation, the inhibitor becomes more active, and the  aPTT will progressively prolong. In contrast, the aPTT  does not correct immediately or with incubation in the  presence of lupus anticoagulants. The presence of serious  bleeding in the presence of mixing studies suggesting  an inhibitor should further rule out lupus anticoagu- lant as a cause because the lupus anticoagulant typically  presents with no symptoms or as a thrombotic disorder.  The mixing studies do not, however, eliminate the pres- ence of heparin as a cause of the prolonged aPTT. If  heparin were present, the thrombin time, but not the  reptilase time, would be prolonged. In this scenario,  both values were normal, ruling out the presence of  heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor. Likewise, dis- seminated intravascular coagulation can be ruled out  in the presence of normal fibrinogen levels. In serious  vitamin K deficiency, both the PT and aPTT should be   prolonged.","B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor

The patient's prolonged aPTT that does not correct with mixing studies suggests the presence of an inhibitor to factor VIII. This is known as acquired hemophilia A, which is a rare autoimmune disorder where the body produces antibodies against factor VIII, leading to bleeding and coagulopathy. This is the most likely cause of the patient's coagulopathy in this case.",The most likely cause of the patient's coagulopathy is B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor.
5,"A 54-year-old man is seen in the clinic complaining  of painless enlargement of lymph nodes in his neck.  He has not otherwise been ill and denies fevers,  chills, weight loss, and fatigue. His past medical  history is remarkable for pulmonary tuberculosis  that was treated 10 years previously under directly  observed therapy. He currently takes no medica- tions. He is a heterosexual man in a monogamous  relationship for 25 years. He denies illicit drug use.  He has smoked 1Â½ packs of cigarettes daily since  16 years of age. He works as a logger. On physical  examination, the patient is thin but not ill-appear- ing. He is not febrile and has normal vital signs.  He has dental caries noted with gingivitis. In the  right supraclavicular area, there is a hard and fixed  lymph node measuring 2.5 Ã— 2.0 cm in size. Lymph  nodes <1 cm in size are noted in the anterior cervi- cal chain. There is no axillary or inguinal lymph- adenopathy. His liver and spleen are not enlarged.  Which of the following factors in history or physi- cal examination increases the likelihood that the  lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy? A. Age older than 50 years B. Location in the supraclavicular area C. Presence of a lymph node that is hard and fixed D. Size >2.25 cm2 (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) E. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 4) Lymphadenopathy has many causes, including  infections, immunologic diseases, and malignancy among  others. In the vast majority of cases, the cause of enlarged  lymph nodes is a benign process. In the primary care  practice, fewer than 1% of individuals will have malig- nancy, and in individuals referred for lymphadenopathy,  this number rises only to 16%. Some features on history  and physical examination lead to an increased likelihood  that the cause of lymphadenopathy is infectious. Fevers  and chills are more commonly present in benign respira- tory illness but can be present in malignancy. Thus, fever  is a nonspecific symptom. Likewise, generalized versus  focal lymphadenopathy is also not specific. The site of  lymph node enlargement can be important and raise  the risk of malignancy. The presence of supraclavicular  lymphadenopathy is never normal. These lymph nodes  drain the thoracic cavity and retroperitoneal space and   are most commonly enlarged in malignancy. However,  infectious etiologies can also cause supraclavicular lymph- adenopathy. The size and texture of the lymph nodes  also provide important information. Nodes <1.0 cm Ã—  1.0 cm are almost always benign, but lymph nodes >2.0 cm   in maximum diameter or with an area of 2.25 cm2  (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) are more likely to be malignant. Nodes  containing metastatic cancer tend to be described as  hard, fixed, and nontender. In lymphoma, however,  the nodes can be tender because of rapid enlargement  of the node with subsequent stretching of the capsule of   the lymph nodes. Lymphomatous nodes are also fre- quently described as firm, rubbery, and mobile.","E. All of the above

All of the factors listed in the options (age older than 50 years, location in the supraclavicular area, presence of a lymph node that is hard and fixed, and size >2.25 cm2) increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy. These factors are commonly associated with malignancies such as lymphoma or metastatic cancer.",E. All of the above
6,"A 24-year-old woman presents for a routine  checkup and complains only of small masses in her  groin. She states that they have been present for at  least 3 years. She denies fever, malaise, weight loss,  and anorexia. She works as a sailing instructor and  competes in triathlons. On physical examination,  she is noted to have several palpable 1-cm inguinal  lymph nodes that are mobile, nontender, and dis- crete. There is no other lymphadenopathy or focal  findings on examination. What should be the next  step in management? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis C. Excisional biopsy D. Fine-needle aspiration for culture and cytopathology E. Pelvic ultrasonography F. Reassurance","The answer is F.  (Chap. 4) This patientâ€™s lymphadenopathy is benign.  Inguinal nodes smaller than 2 cm are common in the  population at large and need no further workup pro- vided that there is no other evidence of disseminated  infection or tumor and that the nodes have qualities that  do not suggest tumor (not hard or matted). A practi- cal approach would be to measure the nodes or even  photograph them if visible and follow them serially over  time. Occasionally, inguinal lymph nodes can be associ- ated with sexually transmitted diseases. However, these  are usually ipsilateral and tender, and evaluation includes  bimanual examination and appropriate cultures, not nec- essarily pelvic ultrasonography. A total-body CT scan  would be indicated if other pathologic nodes suggestive  of lymphoma or granulomatous disease are present in  other anatomic locations. Bone marrow biopsy would  be indicated only if a diagnosis of lymphoma is made  first.","C. Excisional biopsy

Given the patient's history of small masses in the groin that have been present for at least 3 years, the next step in management should be an excisional biopsy of the inguinal lymph nodes to determine the cause of the masses. This will provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management if necessary.",C. Excisional biopsy
7,All of the following diseases are associated with  massive splenomegaly (spleen extends 8 cm below  the costal margin or weighs >1000 g) EXCEPT: A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension D. Marginal zone lymphoma E. Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 4) Portal hypertension causes splenomegaly via  passive congestion of the spleen. It generally causes only  mild enlargement of the spleen because expanded varices  provide some decompression for elevated portal pres- sures. Myelofibrosis necessitates extramedullary hemato- poiesis in the spleen, liver, and even other sites such as  the peritoneum, leading to massive splenomegaly caused  by myeloid hyperproduction. Autoimmune hemolytic  anemia requires the spleen to dispose of massive amounts  of damaged red blood cells, leading to reticuloendothe- lial hyperplasia and frequently an extremely large spleen.  Chronic myeloid leukemia and other leukemias and  lymphomas can lead to massive splenomegaly caused by  infiltration with an abnormal clone of cells. Marginal  zone lymphoma typically presents with splenomegaly. If  a patient with cirrhosis or right heart failure has mas- sive splenomegaly, a cause other than passive congestion  should be considered.","C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension

Cirrhosis with portal hypertension is not typically associated with massive splenomegaly.",B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
8,"The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bod- ies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood  cells in a patient with hairy cell leukemia before  any treatment intervention implies which of the  following? A. Diffuse splenic infiltration by tumor B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) C. Hemolytic anemia D. Pancytopenia E. Transformation to acute leukemia","The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear  remnants), Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin), baso- philic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) in  the peripheral blood implies that the spleen is not properly  clearing senescent or damaged RBCs from the circula- tion. This usually occurs because of surgical splenectomy  but is also possible when there is diffuse infiltration of  the spleen with malignant cells. Hemolytic anemia can  have various peripheral smear findings depending on the  etiology of the hemolysis. Spherocytes and bite cells are  an example of damaged RBCs that might appear because  of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and oxidative dam- age, respectively. Disseminated intravascular coagulation  is characterized by schistocytes and thrombocytopenia  on smear with an elevated international normalized ratio   Review and Self-Assessment 755 and activated partial thromboplastin time as well. How- ever, in these conditions, damaged RBCs are still cleared  effectively by the spleen. Transformation to acute leuke- mia does not lead to splenic damage.","C. Hemolytic anemia

These findings are characteristic of hemolytic anemia, which is commonly seen in patients with hairy cell leukemia due to the destruction of red blood cells by the abnormal leukemia cells.",C. Hemolytic anemia
9,Which of the following is true regarding infection  risk after elective splenectomy? A. Patients are at no increased risk of viral infection  after splenectomy. B. Patients should be vaccinated 2 weeks after splenec- tomy. C. Splenectomy patients over the age of 50 are at great- est risk for postsplenectomy sepsis. D. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly impli- cated organism in postsplenectomy sepsis. E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases  with time.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) Splenectomy leads to an increased risk of  overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, an infection  that carries an extremely high mortality rate. The most  commonly implicated organisms are encapsulated. Strep- tococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and sometime  gram-negative enteric organisms are most frequently  isolated. There is no known increased risk for any viral  infections. Vaccination for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae,  and Neisseria meningitidis is indicated for any patient who  may undergo splenectomy. The vaccines should be  given at least 2 weeks before surgery. The highest risk  of sepsis occurs in patients younger than 20 years of age  because the spleen is responsible for first-pass immunity,  and younger patients are more likely to have primary  exposure to implicated organisms. The risk is highest  during the first 3 years after splenectomy and persists at a  lower rate until death.",E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases with time.,E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases with time.
10,"An 18-year-old man is seen in consultation for a  pulmonary abscess caused by infection with Staph- ylococcus aureus. He had been in his usual state of  health until 1 week ago when he developed fevers  and a cough. He has no ill contacts and presents in  the summer. His medical history is significant for  episodes of axillary and perianal abscesses requiring  incision and drainage. He cannot specifically recall  how often this has occurred, but he does know it has  been more than five times that he can recall. In one  instance, he recalls a lymph node became enlarged  to the point that it â€œpoppedâ€ and drained sponta- neously. He also reports frequent aphthous ulcers  and is treated for eczema. On physical examination,  his height is 5â€²3â€³. He appears ill with a temperature  of 39.6Â°C. Eczematous dermatitis is present in the  scalp and periorbital area. There are crackles at the  left lung base. Axillary lymphadenopathy is present  bilaterally and is tender. The spleen in enlarged. His  laboratory studies show a white blood cell count of  12,500/Î¼L (94% neutrophils), hemoglobin of 11.3  g/dL, hematocrit of 34.2%, and platelets of 320,000/ Î¼L. Granulomatous inflammation is seen on lymph   Review and Self-Assessment 728    node biopsy. Which of the following tests are most  likely found in this patient? A. Elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level B. Eosinophilia C. Giant primary granules in neutrophils D. Mutations of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor E. Positive nitroblue tetrazolium dye test","The answer is E.  (Chap. 5) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an  inherited disorder of abnormal phagocyte function. Sev- enty percent of cases are inherited in an X-linked fashion  with the other 30% being autosomal recessive. Affected  individuals are susceptible to infectious with catalase- positive organisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus. Other  organisms that can be seen include Burkholderia cepacia,  Aspergillus spp., and Chromobacterium violaceum. Most  individuals present in childhood, and infections com- monly affect the skin, ears, lungs, liver, and bone. Exces- sive inflammatory reaction can lead to suppuration of  lymph nodes, and granulomatous inflammation can be  seen on lymph node biopsy and found in the gastro- intestinal and genitourinary tracts. Aphthous ulcers and  eczematous skin rash can also be seen. The underlying  genetic defect in CGD is the inability of neutrophils and  monocytes to generate the appropriate oxidative burst in  response to infectious organisms. Several mutations can  lead to the disease, and these affect one of the five sub- units of the NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) oxidase enzyme. The test of choice to  diagnose chronic granulomatous disease is the nitroblue  tetrazolium dye test, which demonstrates lack of super- oxide and hydrogen peroxide production in the face of  an appropriate stimulus.","D. Mutations of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor

This patient's history of recurrent abscesses, aphthous ulcers, eczema, and granulomatous inflammation on lymph node biopsy is suggestive of hyper-IgE syndrome, also known as Job syndrome. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene, leading to impaired Th17 cell differentiation and decreased production of IL-17. Patients with hyper-IgE syndrome are prone to recurrent infections, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus, as well as eczema, abscesses, and pneumonias. Mutations in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor are not associated with hyper-IgE syndrome.",A. Elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme level
11,"A 72-year-old man with chronic obstructive pul- monary disease and stable coronary disease presents  to the emergency department with several days of  worsening productive cough, fevers, malaise, and  diffuse muscle aches. A chest radiograph demon- strates a new lobar infiltrate. Laboratory measure- ments reveal a total white blood cell count of 12,100  cells/Î¼L with a neutrophilic predominance of 86%  and 8% band forms. He is diagnosed with commu- nity-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotic treatment  is initiated. Under normal, or â€œnonstress,â€ condi- tions, what percentage of the total body neutrophils  are present in the circulation? A. 2% B. 10% C. 25% D. 40% E. 90%","The answer is A.  (Chap. 5) Under normal or nonstress conditions, roughly  90% of the neutrophil pool is in the bone marrow, 2â€“3%  in the circulation, and the remainder in the tissues. The  circulating pool includes the freely flowing cells in the  bloodstream and the others are marginated in close prox- imity to the endothelium. Most of the marginated pool is  in the lung, which has a vascular endothelium surface area.  Margination in the postcapillary venules is mediated by  selectins that cause a low-affinity neutrophilâ€“endothelial  cell interaction that mediates â€œrollingâ€ of the neutrophils  along the endothelium. A variety of signals, including  interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor Î±, and other che- mokines, can cause leukocytes to proliferate and leave  the bone marrow and enter the circulation. Neutrophil  integrins mediate the stickiness of neutrophils to endo- thelium and are important for chemokine-induced cell  activation. Infection causes a marked increase in bone  marrow production of neutrophils that marginate and  enter tissue. Acute glucocorticoids increase neutrophil  count by mobilizing cells from the bone marrow and  marginated pool.","B. 10%

Under normal conditions, approximately 10% of total body neutrophils are present in the circulation. The majority of neutrophils are stored in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream in response to infection or inflammation.","Under normal conditions, approximately 2% of the total body neutrophils are present in the circulation."
12,"A patient with longstanding HIV infection, alco- holism, and asthma is seen in the emergency depart- ment for 1â€“2 days of severe wheezing. He has not  been taking any medicines for months. He is admit- ted to the hospital and treated with nebulized ther- apy and systemic glucocorticoids. His CD4 count is  8 and viral load is >750,000. His total white blood  cell (WBC) count is 3200 cells/Î¼L with 90% neu- trophils. He is accepted into an inpatient substance  abuse rehabilitation program and before discharge  is started on opportunistic infection prophylaxis,  bronchodilators, a prednisone taper over 2 weeks,  ranitidine, and highly active antiretroviral therapy.  The rehabilitation center pages you 2 weeks later; a  routine laboratory check reveals a total WBC count  of 900 cells/Î¼L with 5% neutrophils. Which of the  following new drugs would most likely explain this  patientâ€™s neutropenia? A. Darunavir B. Efavirenz C. Ranitidine D. Prednisone E. Trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole","The answer is E.  (Chap. 5) Many drugs can lead to neutropenia, most  commonly via retarding neutrophil production in   the bone marrow. Of the list in the answer choices, tri- methoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole is the most likely culprit.  Other common causes of drug-induced neutropenia  include alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or  busulfan, antimetabolites including methotrexate and  5-flucytosine, penicillin and sulfonamide antibiotics,  antithyroid drugs, antipsychotics, and anti-inflammatory  agents. Prednisone, when used systemically, often causes  an increase in the circulating neutrophil count because  it leads to demargination of neutrophils and bone mar- row stimulation. Ranitidine, an H2 blocker, is a well- described cause of thrombocytopenia but has not been  implicated in neutropenia. Efavirenz is a nonnucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor whose main side effects  include a morbilliform rash and central nervous system  effects, including strange dreams and confusion. The  presence of these symptoms does not require drug ces- sation. Darunavir is a new protease inhibitor that is well  tolerated. Common side effects include a maculopapu- lar rash and lipodystrophy, a class effect for all protease  inhibitors.","E. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a common antibiotic used for opportunistic infection prophylaxis in patients with HIV. Neutropenia is a known side effect of this medication. Given the patient's history of HIV and low CD4 count, it is likely that the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is causing the neutropenia in this case.",E. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
13,All the following are suggestive of iron-deficiency  anemia EXCEPT: A. Koilonychia B. Pica C. Decreased serum ferritin D. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) E. Low reticulocyte response,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 7) Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition con- sisting of anemia and clear evidence of iron deficiency.  It is one of the most prevalent forms of malnutrition.  Globally, 50% of anemia is attributable to iron deficiency  and accounts for approximately 841,000 deaths annu- ally worldwide. Africa and parts of Asia bear 71% of the  global mortality burden; North America represents only  1.4% of the total morbidity and mortality associated with  iron deficiency. Initially, a state of negative iron balance  occurs during which iron stores become slowly depleted.  Serum ferritin may decrease, and the presence of stain- able iron on bone marrow preparation decreases. When   Review and Self-Assessment 756 iron stores are depleted, serum iron begins to fall. Total  iron-binding capacity (TIBC) starts to increase, reflecting  the presence of circulating unbound transferrin. When  the transferrin saturation falls to 15â€“20%, hemoglobin  synthesis is impaired. The peripheral blood smear reveals  the presence of microcytic and hypochromic red blood  cells. Reticulocytes may also become hypochromic.  Reticulocyte numbers are reduced relative to the level  of anemia, reflecting a hypoproduction anemia second- ary to iron deficiency. Clinically, these patients exhibit  the usual signs of anemia, which are fatigue, pallor, and  reduced exercise capacity. Cheilosis and koilonychia are  signs of advanced tissue iron deficiency. Some patients  may experience pica, a desire to ingest certain materials,  such as ice (pagophagia) and clay (geophagia).",D. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC),A. Koilonychia
14,A 24-year-old man with a history of poorly treated  chronic ulcerative colitis is found to have ane- mia with a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and a reduced  mean corpuscular volume. His ferritin is 250 Î¼g/L.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of  his anemia? A. Folate deficiency B. Hemoglobinopathy C. Inflammation D. Iron deficiency E. Sideroblastic anemia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) (See Table 7-4.) The differential diagnosis of  microcytic anemia includes iron deficiency, hemoglo- binopathy (e.g., thalassemia), myelodysplastic syndromes  (including sideroblastic anemia), and chronic inflamma- tion. Inflammation can be distinguished from iron defi- ciency because iron deficiency typically includes a very  low ferritin level (<50 Î¼g/L) and iron binding satura- tion, but in inflammation, they are normal or increased.  Any chronic inflammatory state may cause a hypopro- liferative anemia caused by inadequate marrow utiliza- tion of iron related to hyperproduction of a number of  cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon- gamma, and interleukin-1. The anemia of chronic dis- ease may be normocytic/normochromic or microcytic.  Serum iron and iron binding are normal to high in  thalassemia and sideroblastic anemia. Folate deficiency  causes macrocytic anemia.","C. Inflammation

Inflammation is the most likely cause of anemia in this patient with chronic ulcerative colitis. Chronic inflammation can lead to anemia of chronic disease, also known as anemia of inflammation. This type of anemia is characterized by decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis, leading to reduced hemoglobin levels and microcytic anemia. The elevated ferritin level in this patient is consistent with anemia of inflammation, as ferritin levels can be elevated in the setting of chronic inflammation.",Iron deficiency
15,All of the following statements regarding the ane- mia of chronic kidney disease are true EXCEPT: A. The degree of anemia correlates with the stage of  chronic kidney disease. B. Erythropoietin levels are reduced. C. Ferritin is reduced. D. It is typically normocytic and normochromic. E. Reticulocytes are decreased.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is  usually associated with a moderate to severe hypoprolif- erative anemia. The level of the anemia correlates with  the stage of CKD. Red blood cells (RBCs) are typically  normocytic and normochromic, and reticulocytes are  decreased. The anemia is primarily caused by a failure  of erythropoietin (EPO) production by the diseased kid- ney and a reduction in RBC survival. Polycystic kidney  disease shows a smaller degree of EPO deficiency for a  given level of renal failure. By contrast, patients with  diabetes or myeloma have more severe EPO deficiency  for a given level of renal failure. Assessment of iron sta- tus provides information to distinguish the anemia of  CKD from other forms of hypoproliferative anemia  and to guide management. Patients with the anemia of  CKD usually present with normal serum iron, total iron- binding capacity, and ferritin levels. However, those  maintained on chronic hemodialysis may develop iron  deficiency from blood loss through the dialysis proce- dure. EPO therapy is effective in correcting the anemia  of CKD. Iron must be replenished in patients with con- comitant iron deficiency to ensure an adequate response  to EPO therapy.","C. Ferritin is reduced. 

Ferritin levels are typically elevated in chronic kidney disease due to inflammation and decreased clearance by the kidneys.",A. The degree of anemia correlates with the stage of chronic kidney disease.
16,All of the following statements regarding the utility  of hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease  are true EXCEPT: A. It is effective in reducing painful crises. B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production  of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow. C. It should be considered in patients with repeated  acute chest syndrome episodes. D. Its mechanism involves increasing production of fetal  hemoglobin. E. The major adverse effect is a reduction in white  blood cell count.,"The answer is B. (Chap. 8, MM Hsieh et al: N Engl J Med 2009;361:2309â€“2317)  The most significant recent advance in the therapy of  sickle cell anemia has been the introduction of hydroxy- urea as a mainstay of therapy for patients with severe  symptoms. Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin and  may exert beneficial effects on red blood cell (RBC)  hydration, vascular wall adherence, and suppression of  the granulocyte and reticulocyte counts. Hemoglobin  F levels increase in most patients within a few months.  Hydroxyurea should be considered in patients experienc- ing repeated episodes of acute chest syndrome or with  more than three crises per year requiring hospitaliza- tion. The utility of this agent for reducing the incidence  of other complications (priapism, retinopathy) is under  evaluation, as are the long-term side effects. Hydroxy- urea offers broad benefits to most patients whose disease  is severe enough to impair their functional status, and it  may improve survival. The main adverse effect is a reduc- tion in white blood cell (WBC) count; dosage should  be titrated to maintain a WBC count at 5000 to 8000/ Î¼L. WBCs and reticulocytes may play a major role in  the pathogenesis of sickle cell crisis, and their suppression  may be an important benefit of hydroxyurea therapy. A  recent study demonstrated that nonmyeloablative bone  marrow transplantation in patients with sickle cell dis- ease could produce a stable chimera that corrected RBC  counts and reversed the sickle cell phenotype.","B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow. 

This statement is not true. Hydroxyurea works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin, not hemoglobin A.",B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow.
17,Which of the following is the most cost-effective  test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin  (vitamin B12) deficiency? A. Red blood cell folate B. Serum cobalamin C. Serum homocysteine D. Serum methylmalonate E. Serum pepsinogen  Review and Self-Assessment 729,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 9) Serum cobalamin is measured by an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay test and is the most cost- effective test to rule out deficiency. Normal serum  levels are typically above 200 ng/L. In patients with  megaloblastic anemia caused by cobalamin deficiency,  the level is usually <100 ng/L. In general, the more  severe the deficiency, the lower the serum cobalamin  level. In patients with spinal cord damage caused by the  deficiency, levels are very low even in the absence of  anemia. Borderline low levels may occur in pregnancy  in patients with megaloblastic anemia caused by folate  deficiency. In patients with cobalamin deficiency suf- ficient to cause anemia or neuropathy, the serum meth- ylmalonate (MMA) level is increased. Serum MMA and  homocysteine levels have been proposed for the early  diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency even in the absence of  hematologic abnormalities or subnormal levels of serum  cobalamin. Serum MMA levels fluctuate, however, in  patients with renal failure. Mildly elevated serum MMA  or homocysteine levels occur in up to 30% of apparently  healthy volunteers and 15% of elderly subjects. These  findings bring into question the exact cutoff points for   Review and Self-Assessment 757 normal MMA and homocysteine levels. It is also unclear  at present whether these mildly increased metabolite lev- els have clinical consequences. Serum homocysteine is  increased in both early cobalamin and folate deficiency  but may also be increased in other conditions (e.g.,  chronic renal disease; alcoholism; smoking; pyridoxine  deficiency; hypothyroidism; and therapy with steroids,  cyclosporine, and other drugs). The red blood cell folate  assay is a test of body folate stores. It is less affected than  the serum assay by recent diet and traces of hemolysis.  Subnormal levels occur in patients with megaloblastic  anemia caused by folate deficiency but also in nearly  two-thirds of patients with severe cobalamin deficiency.  False-normal results may occur if a folate-deficient  patient has received a recent blood transfusion or if a  patient has an increased reticulocyte count. Serum pep- sinogen may be low in patients with pernicious anemia.","B. Serum cobalamin

Serum cobalamin (vitamin B12) levels are the most cost-effective test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin deficiency. Low serum cobalamin levels are indicative of a deficiency, which can lead to symptoms such as anemia, fatigue, and neurological problems. Other tests such as serum homocysteine and serum methylmalonate can also be useful in diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, but serum cobalamin is typically the first test ordered due to its cost-effectiveness. Red blood cell folate and serum pepsinogen are not typically used to evaluate for cobalamin deficiency.",C. Serum homocysteine
18,A patient being evaluated for anemia has the periph- eral blood smear shown in Figure 20. Which of  the following is the most likely cause of the anemia?  A. Acute lymphocytic leukemia B. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13 C. Cobalamin deficiency D. Epstein-Barr virus infection E. Iron deficiency,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 9) The peripheral blood smear shows hypochro- masia, macrocytosis, and a hypersegmented (>five lobes)  neutrophil. These findings are typical for a megaloblastic  anemia as seen in cobalamin or folate deficiency. The  mean corpuscular volume is typically >100 fL, and there  is significant anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. There may  also be leukopenia and thrombocytopenia that corre- late with the degree of deficiency. Other less common  causes of megaloblastic anemia include therapy with  drugs that interfere with folate metabolism (methotrex- ate) or DNA synthesis (hydroxyurea, AZT, cytosine  arabinoside, 6-mercaptopurine) and some cases of acute  myeloblastic leukemia or myelodysplasia. Autoantibod- ies to ADAMTS-13 are associated with thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura, which causes a microangio- pathic hemolytic anemia. Epstein-Barr virus infection is  associated with large atypical lymphocytes, not hyper- segmented neutrophils. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  microcytic hypochromic anemia.","E. Iron deficiency

Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, characterized by microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells on peripheral blood smear. This is consistent with the findings in the image provided. The other options listed are not typically associated with this type of peripheral blood smear.",C. Cobalamin deficiency
19,Patients from which of the following regions need  not be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydro- genase (G6PD) deficiency when starting a drug that  carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis? A. Brazil B. Russia C. Southeast Asia D. Southern Europe E. Sub-Saharan Africa F. None of the above,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) Red blood cells (RBCs) use glutathione  produced by the hexose monophosphate shunt to com- pensate for increased production of reactive oxygen spe- cies (oxidant stress), usually induced by drugs or toxins.  Defects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)  are the most common congenital hexose monophos- phate shunt defect. If the RBC is unable to maintain  an adequate level of glutathione during oxidant stress,  hemoglobin precipitates in the RBC, producing Heinz  bodies. Because the G6PD gene is on the X chromo- some, almost all affected patients are males. G6PD defi- ciency is widely distributed throughout regions that are  currently or were once highly malarial endemic. It is  common in males of African, African American, Sardin- ian, and Sephardic descent. In most persons with G6PD  deficiency, there is no evidence of symptomatic disease.  However, infection, ingestion of fava beans, or exposure  to an oxidative agent (drug or toxin) can trigger an acute  hemolytic event. Bite cells, Heinz bodies, and bizarre  poikilocytes may be evident on smear. The drugs that  most commonly precipitate a G6PD crisis include dap- sone, sulfamethoxazole, primaquine, and nitrofurantoin.  The anemia is often severe with rapid onset after drug  ingestion, and renal failure can occur.","F. None of the above

Patients from all regions listed should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency before starting a drug that carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis.",Patients from Southeast Asia need not be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency when starting a drug that carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis.
20,"A 36-year-old African American woman with sys- temic lupus erythematosus presents with the acute  onset of lethargy and jaundice. On initial evalua- tion, she is tachycardic and hypotensive, appears  pale, is dyspneic, and is somewhat difficult to  arouse. Physical examination reveals splenomegaly.  Her initial hemoglobin is 6 g/dL, white blood cell  count is 6300/Î¼L, and platelets are 294,000/Î¼L.  Her total bilirubin is 4 g/dL, reticulocyte count  is 18%, and haptoglobin is not detectable. Renal  function is normal, as is urinalysis. What would you  expect on her peripheral blood smear? A. Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes  with hypersegmented nuclei B. Microspherocytes C. Schistocytes D. Sickle cells E. Target cells","The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) This patientâ€™s lupus and her rapid develop- ment of truly life-threatening hemolytic anemia are  both very suggestive of autoimmune hemolytic ane- mia. Diagnosis is made by a positive Coombs test result  documenting antibodies to the red cell membrane, but  smear will often show microspherocytes, indicative of  the damage incurred to the red cells in the spleen. Schis- tocytes are typical for microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mias such as hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura. The lack of thrombocyto- penia makes these diagnoses considerably less plausible.  Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes with  hypersegmented nuclei are very suggestive of vitamin  B12 deficiency, which causes more chronic, nonâ€“life- threatening anemia. Target cells are seen in liver disease  and thalassemias. Sickle cell anemia is associated with  aplastic crises, but this patient has no known diagnosis of  sickle cell disease and is showing evidence of erythropoi- etin response based on the presence of elevated reticu- locyte count.","C. Schistocytes

This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with hemolytic anemia, likely due to autoimmune hemolysis in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus. The presence of jaundice, splenomegaly, low haptoglobin, and elevated reticulocyte count are all indicative of hemolysis. Schistocytes, or fragmented red blood cells, are commonly seen in hemolytic anemias and would be expected on peripheral blood smear in this patient.",C. Schistocytes
21,"A 22-year-old pregnant woman of northern Euro- pean descent presents 3 months into her first preg- nancy with extreme fatigue, pallor, and icterus. She  reports being previously healthy. On evaluation,  her hemoglobin is 8 g/dL with a normal mean cor- puscular volume and an elevated mean corpuscu- lar hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count  of 9%, and indirect bilirubin of 4.9 mg/dL; serum  haptoglobin is not detectable. Her peripheral smear  is shown in Figure 23. Her physical examination  is notable for splenomegaly and a normal 3-month  uterus. What is the most likely diagnosis?  A. Colonic polyp B. G6PD deficiency C. Hereditary spherocytosis D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","The answer is C.  (Chap. 10) The peripheral blood smear shows micro- spherocytes, small densely staining red blood cells  (RBCs) that have lost their central pallor characteris- tic of hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytosis is almost  the only condition with an increased mean corpuscular  hemoglobin concentration. Hereditary spherocytosis is a  heterogeneous RBC membranopathy that can be either  congenital (usually autosomal dominant) or acquired; it  is characterized by predominantly extravascular hemo- lysis in the spleen caused by defects in membrane struc- tural proteins. This spleen-mediated hemolysis leads to  the conversion of classic biconcave RBCs on smear to  spherocytes. Splenomegaly is common. This disorder  can be severe, depending on the site of mutation, but  is often overlooked until some stressor such as preg- nancy leads to a multifactorial anemia, or an infection  such as parvovirus B19 transiently eliminates RBC pro- duction altogether. Acute treatment is with transfusion.  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency  is a cause of hemolysis that is usually triggered by the  presence of an offending oxidative agent. The peripheral  blood smear may show Heinz bodies. Parvovirus infec- tion may cause a pure RBC aplasia. The presence of  active reticulocytosis and laboratory findings consistent   Review and Self-Assessment 758 with hemolysis are not compatible with that diagnosis.  Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, such as caused by a  colonic polyp, would cause a microcytic, hypochromic  anemia without evidence of hemolysis (indirect biliru- bin, haptoglobin abnormalities).","C. Hereditary spherocytosis

This patient's presentation is consistent with hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the red blood cell membrane leading to hemolysis. The elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and spherocytes seen on the peripheral smear are characteristic findings. Additionally, the presence of splenomegaly and jaundice are common features of the disease. Treatment may involve splenectomy in severe cases.",C. Hereditary spherocytosis
22,"The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis,  and pancytopenia suggests which of the following   diagnoses? A. Acute promyelocytic leukemia B. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) C. Leptospirosis D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) FIGURE 23 FIGURE 20  Review and Self-Assessment 730","The answer is D. (Chap. 10) Each of the listed diagnoses has a rather char- acteristic set of laboratory findings that are virtually diag- nostic for the disease once the disease has progressed to a  severe stage. The combination of portal vein thrombo- sis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is typical for paroxysmal  nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare disor- der characterized by hemolytic anemia (particularly at  night), venous thrombosis, and deficient hematopoiesis.  It is a stem cellâ€“derived intracorpuscular defect. Ane- mia is usually moderate in severity, and there is often  concomitant granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.  Venous thrombosis occurs much more commonly than  in the population at large. The intraabdominal veins are  often involved, and patients may present with Budd- Chiari syndrome. Cerebral sinus thrombosis is a com- mon cause of death in patients with PNH. The presence  of pancytopenia and hemolysis should raise suspicion for  this diagnosis even before the development of a venous  thrombosis. In the past, PNH was diagnosed by abnor- malities on the Ham or sucrose lysis test; however, cur- rently flow cytometry analysis of glycosylphosphati- dylinositol (GPI) linked proteins (e.g., CD55 and CD59)  on red blood cells and granulocytes is recommended.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) both cause hemolysis  and thrombocytopenia, as well as fevers. Cerebrovascu- lar events and mental status change occur more com- monly in TTP, and renal failure is more common in  HUS. Severe leptospirosis, or Weilâ€™s disease, is notable  for fevers, hyperbilirubinemia, and renal failure. Con- junctival suffusion is another helpful clue. Acute promy- elocytic leukemia is notable for anemia, thrombocytope- nia, and either elevated or a decreased white blood cell  count, all in the presence of disseminated intravascular  coagulation.",D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
23,All of the following laboratory values are consistent  with an intravascular hemolytic anemia EXCEPT: A. Increased haptoglobin B. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) C. Increased reticulocyte count D. Increased unconjugated bilirubin E. Increased urine hemosiderin,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 10) Haptoglobin is an Î±-globulin normally pres- ent in serum. It binds specifically to the globin portion of  hemoglobin, and the complex is cleared by the mono- nuclear cell phagocytosis. Haptoglobin is reduced in all  hemolytic anemias because it binds free hemoglobin. It  can also be reduced in cirrhosis and so is not diagnostic of  hemolysis outside of the correct clinical context. Assum- ing normal bone marrow and iron stores, the reticulo- cyte count will be elevated as well to try to compensate  for the increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction of  hemolysis. Release of intracellular contents from the  RBC (including hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase)  induces heme metabolism, producing unconjugated bili- rubinemia. If the haptoglobin system is overwhelmed,  the kidney will filter free hemoglobin and reabsorb it in  the proximal tubule for storage of iron by ferritin and  hemosiderin. Hemosiderin in the urine is a marker of fil- tered hemoglobin by the kidneys. In massive hemolysis,  free hemoglobin may be excreted in urine.","A. Increased haptoglobin

Haptoglobin is a protein that binds free hemoglobin in the blood and helps prevent its loss through the kidneys. In intravascular hemolytic anemia, there is an increased breakdown of red blood cells, leading to an increase in free hemoglobin in the blood. As a result, haptoglobin levels are decreased, not increased.",A. Increased haptoglobin
24,Which of the following hemolytic anemias can be  classified as extracorpuscular? A. Elliptocytosis B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria C. Pyruvate kinase deficiency D. Sickle cell anemia E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 10) Hemolytic anemias may be classified as intra- corpuscular or extracorpuscular. In intracorpuscular  disorders, the patientâ€™s red blood cells (RBCs) have an  abnormally short life span because of an intrinsic RBC  factor. In extracorpuscular disorders, the RBC has a  short life span because of a nonintrinsic RBC factor.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an  acquired disorder in which red blood cell and platelet  destruction occur not because of defects of these cell  lines but rather as a result of microangiopathy leading  to destructive shear forces on the cells. Other clinical  signs and symptoms include fever; mental status change;  and, less commonly, renal impairment. Most acquired  adult cases of TTP are associated with autoantibodies to  ADAMTS-13 (or von Willebrand factorâ€“cleaving pro- tease). All cases of hemolysis in conjunction with throm- bocytopenia should be rapidly ruled out for TTP by  evaluation of a peripheral smear for schistocytes because  plasmapheresis is lifesaving. Other causes of extravascular  hemolytic anemia include hypersplenism, autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagula- tion, and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.  The other four disorders listed in the question all refer  to some defect of the RBC itself that leads to hemo- lysis. Elliptocytosis is a membranopathy that leads to   varying degrees of destruction of the RBC in the reticu- loendothelial system. Sickle cell anemia is a congenital  hemoglobinopathy classified by recurrent pain crises and  numerous long-term sequelae that is caused by a well- defined Î²-globin mutation. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is a rare disorder of the glycolytic pathway that causes  hemolytic anemia. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin- uria (PNH) is a form of acquired hemolysis caused by an  intrinsic abnormality of the RBCs. It also often causes  thrombosis and cytopenias. Bone marrow failure is a  feared association with PNH.",A. Elliptocytosis,B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
25,"A 34-year-old woman with a medical history of sickle  cell anemia presents with a 5-day history of fatigue,  lethargy, and shortness of breath. She denies chest  pain and bone pain. She has had no recent travel. Of  note, the patientâ€™s 4-year-old daughter had a â€œcoldâ€  2 weeks before the presentation. On examination,  the woman has pale conjunctiva, is anicteric, and is  mildly tachycardic. Abdominal examination is unre- markable. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of  3 g/dL; her baseline is 8 g/dL. The white blood cell  count and platelets are normal. Reticulocyte count  is undetectable. Total bilirubin is 1.4 mg/dL. Lactic  dehydrogenase is at the upper limits of the normal  range. Peripheral blood smear shows a few sickled  cells but a total absence of reticulocytes. The patient  is given a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood  cells and admitted to the hospital. A bone marrow  biopsy shows a normal myeloid series but an absence  of erythroid precursors. Cytogenetics are normal.  What is the most appropriate next management step? A. Make arrangements for exchange transfusion. B. Tissue type her siblings for a possible bone marrow  transplant. C. Check parvovirus titers. D. Start prednisone and cyclosporine. E. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 11) Pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA) is a con- dition characterized by the absence of reticulocytes and  erythroid precursors. A variety of conditions may cause  PRCA. It may be idiopathic. It may be associated with  certain medications, such as trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethox- azole (TMP-SMX) and phenytoin. It can be associated  with a variety of neoplasms, either as a precursor to a  hematologic malignancy such as leukemia or myelo- dysplasia or as part of an autoimmune phenomenon,   Review and Self-Assessment 759 as in the case of thymoma. Infections also may cause  PRCA. Parvovirus B19 is a single-strand DNA virus that  is associated with erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease  in children. It is also associated with arthropathy and a  flulike illness in adults. It is thought to attack the P anti- gen on proerythroblasts directly. Patients with a chronic  hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell disease, or with an  immunodeficiency are less able to tolerate a transient  drop in reticulocytes because their red blood cells do not  survive in the peripheral blood for an adequate period.  In this patient, her daughter had an illness before the  appearance of her symptoms. It is reasonable to check  her parvovirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers. If the  results are positive, a dose of intravenous Ig is indicated.  Because her laboratory test results and smear are not  suggestive of dramatic sickling, an exchange transfusion  is not indicated. Immunosuppression with prednisone,  cyclosporine, or both may be indicated if another etiol- ogy of the PRCA is identified. However, that would  not be the next step. Similarly, a bone marrow trans- plant might be a consideration in a young patient with  myelodysplasia or leukemia, but there is no evidence of  that at this time. Antibiotics have no role in light of her  normal white blood cell count and the lack of evidence  for a bacterial infection.","C. Check parvovirus titers.

This patient likely has parvovirus B19 infection, which can cause transient aplastic crisis in patients with sickle cell anemia. Checking parvovirus titers can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive, and the patient may require further transfusions. Exchange transfusion, bone marrow transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, and antibiotics are not indicated in this case.",The most appropriate next management step would be C. Check parvovirus titers.
26,Aplastic anemia has been associated with all of the  following EXCEPT: A. Carbamazepine therapy B. Methimazole therapy C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Seronegative hepatitis,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) Aplastic anemia is defined as pancytopenia  with bone marrow hypocellularity. Aplastic anemia  may be acquired, iatrogenic (chemotherapy), or genetic  (e.g., Fanconiâ€™s anemia). Acquired aplastic anemia may  be caused by drugs or chemicals (expected toxicity or  idiosyncratic effects), viral infections, immune diseases,   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, pregnancy, or  idiopathic causes. Aplastic anemia from idiosyncratic  drug reactions (including those listed as well others,  including as quinacrine, phenytoin, sulfonamides, or  cimetidine) are uncommon but may be encountered  given the wide usage of some of these agents. In these  cases, there is usually not a dose-dependent response;  the reaction is idiosyncratic. Seronegative hepatitis is a  cause of aplastic anemia, particularly in young men who  recovered from an episode of liver inflammation 1 to  2 months earlier. Parvovirus B19 infection most com- monly causes pure red blood cell (RBC) aplasia, particu- larly in patients with chronic hemolytic states and high  RBC turnover (e.g., sickle cell anemia).","E.

A blood count reveals  an absolute neutrophil count of 780/Î¼L, hemato- crit of 18%, and platelet count of 21,000/Î¼L. Bone  marrow biopsy reveals hypocellularity with a fatty  marrow. Chromosome studies of peripheral blood  and bone marrow cells are performed that exclude  Fanconiâ€™s anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.  The patient has a fully histocompatible brother.  Which of the following is the best therapy? A. Antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine B. Glucocorticoids C. Growth factors D. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant E. Red blood cell and platelet transfusion","The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) This patient has aplastic anemia. In the absence  of drugs or toxins that cause bone marrow suppression,  it is most likely that he has an immune-mediated injury.  Growth factors are not effective in the setting of hypoplas- tic bone marrow. Transfusion should be avoided unless  emergently needed to prevent the development of allo- antibodies. Glucocorticoids have no efficacy in aplastic  anemia. Immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin  and cyclosporine is a therapy with proven efficacy for this  autoimmune disease with a response rate of up to 70%.  Relapses are common, and myelodysplastic syndrome  or leukemia may occur in approximately 15% of treated  patients. Immunosuppression is the treatment of choice  for patients without suitable bone marrow transplant  donors. Bone marrow transplantation is the best current  therapy for young patients with matched sibling donors.  Allogeneic bone marrow transplants from matched sib- lings result in long-term survival in more than 80% of  patients, with better results in children than adults. The  effectiveness of androgens has not been verified in con- trolled trials, but occasional patients will respond or even  demonstrate blood count dependence on continued ther- apy. Sex hormones upregulate telomerase gene activity in  vitro, possibly also their mechanism of action in improv- ing marrow function. For patients with moderate disease  or those with severe pancytopenia in whom immunosup- pression has failed, a 3 to 4-month trial is appropriate.","D. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Given the patient's severe pancytopenia and bone marrow findings, the best therapy would be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This would provide the patient with healthy stem cells to restore normal blood cell production. This is especially important since the patient has a fully histocompatible brother, making him a suitable donor for the transplant.",D. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

(Chap. 11) Myelodysplasia, or the MDSs, are a hetero- geneous group of hematologic disorders broadly charac- terized by cytopenias associated with a dysmorphic (or  abnormal appearing) and usually cellular bone marrow  and by consequent ineffective blood cell production.  The mean onset of age is after 70 years. MDS is associ- ated with environmental exposures such as radiation and  benzene; other risk factors have been reported inconsis- tently. Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of can- cer treatment, usually with a combination of radiation  and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as busul- fan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period  of 5â€“7 years) or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors   (2 years). Both acquired aplastic anemia after immuno- suppressive treatment and Fanconiâ€™s anemia can evolve  into MDS. MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell dis- order leading to impaired cell proliferation and differen- tiation. Cytogenetic abnormalities are found in approxi- mately half of patients, and some of the same specific  lesions are also seen in frank leukemia. Anemia dominates  the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain  of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea,  and pallor, but at least half of patients are asymptomatic,  and their MDS is discovered only incidentally on routine  blood counts. Previous chemotherapy or radiation expo- sure is an important historic fact. Fever and weight loss  should point to a myeloproliferative rather than myelo- dysplastic process. About 20% of patients have spleno- megaly. Bone marrow is typically hypercellular. Median  survival varies from months to years, depending on the  number of blasts in marrow and the specific cytogenetic  abnormality. Isolated 5q- is associated with a median  survival in years. Most patients die as a result of com- plications of pancytopenia and not because of leukemic    Review and Self-Assessment 760 transformation; perhaps one-third succumb to other dis- eases unrelated to their MDS. Precipitous worsening of  pancytopenia, acquisition of new chromosomal abnor- malities on serial cytogenetic determination, increase in  the number of blasts, and marrow fibrosis are all poor  prognostic indicators. The outlook in therapy-related  MDS, regardless of type, is extremely poor, and most  patients progress within a few months to refractory acute  myeloid leukemia. Historically, the therapy of MDS has  been unsatisfactory. Only stem cell transplantation offers  cure. Survival rates of 50% at 3 years have been reported,  but older patients are particularly prone to develop treat- ment-related mortality and morbidity. Results of trans- plant using matched unrelated donors are comparable,  although most series contain younger and more highly  selected cases. However, multiple new drugs have been  approved for use in MDS. Several regimens appear to  not only improve blood counts but also to delay onset of  leukemia and to improve survival.  Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative with a more  favorable toxicity profile, is particularly effective in  reversing anemia in MDS patients with 5q- syndrome;  a high proportion of these patients become transfusion  independent.","B. He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation.

This statement is not true. Patients with the 5q- syndrome typically have a more indolent course and are less likely to progress to acute myeloid leukemia compared to other myelodysplastic syndromes.",B. He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation.
29,All of the following are considered myeloprolif- erative disorders in the WHO classification system  EXCEPT: A. Chronic myeloid leukemia (bcr-abl positive) B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Mastocytosis D. Polycythemia vera E. Primary effusion lymphoma  Review and Self-Assessment 731,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) The World Health Organizationâ€™s classifica- tion of the chronic myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs)  includes eight disorders, some of which are rare or  poorly characterized but all of which share an origin in a  multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell, overproduc- tion of one or more of the formed elements of the blood  without significant dysplasia, a predilection to extramed- ullary hematopoiesis or myelofibrosis, and transforma- tion at varying rates to acute leukemia. Within this broad  classification, however, significant phenotypic hetero- geneity exists. Some diseases such as chronic myeloid  leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL),  and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) express pri- marily a myeloid phenotype, but in others, such as poly- cythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and  essential thrombocytosis (ET), erythroid or megakaryo- cytic hyperplasia predominates. The latter three disor- ders, in contrast to the former three, also appear capable  of transforming into each other. Such phenotypic het- erogeneity has a genetic basis. CML is the consequence  of the balanced translocation between chromosomes   9 and 22 (t[9;22][q34;11]), CNL has been associated with  a t(15;19) translocation, and CEL occurs with a deletion  or balanced translocations involving the PDGFR-alpha  gene. By contrast, to a greater or lesser extent, PV, PMF,  and ET are characterized by expression of a JAK2 muta- tion, V617F, that causes constitutive activation of this  tyrosine kinase that is essential for the function of the  erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors but not  the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. This  essential distinction is also reflected in the natural history  of CML, CNL, and CEL, which is usually measured in  years, and their high rate of transformation into acute  leukemia. By contrast, the natural history of PV, PMF,  and ET is usually measured in decades, and transforma- tion to acute leukemia is uncommon in the absence of  exposure to mutagenic agents. Primary effusion lym- phoma is not a myeloproliferative disease. It is one of  the diseases (Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, multicentric Castlemanâ€™s  disease) associated with infection with human herpes  virus-8, particularly in immunocompromised hosts.","E. Primary effusion lymphoma

Primary effusion lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, not a myeloproliferative disorder.",E. Primary effusion lymphoma
30,Which of the following statements regarding poly- cythemia vera is correct? A. An elevated plasma erythropoietin level excludes the  diagnosis. B. Transformation to acute leukemia is common. C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic  risk. D. Aspirin should be prescribed to all of these patients  to reduce thrombotic risk. E. Phlebotomy is used only after hydroxyurea and  interferon have been tried.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 13) Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal disorder  that involves a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor  cell. Clinically, it is characterized by a proliferation of  red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes, and platelets. The  precise etiology is unknown. Unlike chronic myeloid  leukemia, no consistent cytogenetic abnormality has  been associated with the disorder. However, a muta- tion in the autoinhibitory, pseudokinase domain of the  tyrosine kinase JAK2â€”that replaces valine with phenyl- alanine (V617F), causing constitutive activation of the  kinaseâ€”appears to have a central role in the pathogen- esis of PV. Erythropoiesis is regulated by the hormone  erythropoietin. Hypoxia is the physiologic stimulus that  increases the number of cells that produce erythropoi- etin. Erythropoietin may be elevated in patients with  hormone-secreting tumors. Levels are usually â€œnormalâ€  in patients with hypoxic erythrocytosis. In PV, how- ever, because erythrocytosis occurs independently of  erythropoietin, levels of the hormone are usually low.  Therefore, an elevated level is not consistent with the  diagnosis. PV is a chronic, indolent disease with a low  rate of transformation to acute leukemia, especially in  the absence of treatment with radiation or hydroxy- urea. Thrombotic complications are the main risk for  PV and correlate with the erythrocytosis. Thrombocy- tosis, although sometimes prominent, does not correlate  with the risk of thrombotic complications. Salicylates are  useful in treating erythromelalgia but are not indicated  in asymptomatic patients. There is no evidence that  thrombotic risk is significantly lowered with their use in  patients whose hematocrits are appropriately controlled  with phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treat- ment. Induction of a state of iron deficiency is critical to  prevent a reexpansion of the RBC mass. Chemothera- peutics and other agents are useful in cases of symptom- atic splenomegaly. Their use is limited by side effects,  and there is a risk of leukemogenesis with hydroxyurea.",C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic risk.,C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic risk.
31,"A 68-year-old man seeks evaluation for fatigue, weight  loss, and early satiety that have been present for about 4  months. On physical examination, his spleen is noted  to be markedly enlarged. It is firm to touch and crosses  the midline. The lower edge of the spleen reaches to  the pelvis. His hemoglobin is 11.1 g/dL and hema- tocrit is 33.7%. The leukocyte count is 6200/Î¼L and  platelet count is 220,000/Î¼L. The white cell count  differential is 75% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 8%  myelocytes, 4% metamyelocytes, 8% lymphocytes,  3% monocytes, and 2% eosinophils. The peripheral  blood smear shows teardrop cells, nucleated red blood  cells, and immature granulocytes. Rheumatoid factor  is positive. A bone marrow biopsy is attempted, but  no cells are able to be aspirated. No evidence of leu- kemia or lymphoma is found. What is the most likely  cause of the splenomegaly? A. Chronic primary myelofibrosis B. Chronic myeloid leukemia C. Rheumatoid arthritis D. Systemic lupus erythematosus E. Tuberculosis","The answer is A.  (Chap. 13) Chronic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is the  least common myeloproliferative disorder and is considered   Review and Self-Assessment 761 a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of myelofi- brosis have been ruled out. The typical patient with PMF  presents in the sixth decade of life, and the disorder is  asymptomatic in many patients. Fevers, fatigue, night  sweats, and weight loss may occur in PMF, but these  symptoms are rare in other myeloproliferative disorders.  However, no signs or symptoms are specific for the diag- nosis of PMF. Often marked splenomegaly is present and  may extend across the midline and to the pelvic brim. A  peripheral blood smear demonstrates the typical findings  of myelofibrosis, including teardrop-shaped red blood  cells (RBCs), nucleated RBCs, myelocytes, and metamy- elocytes that are indicative of extramedullary hematopoi- esis. Anemia is usually mild, and platelet and leukocyte  counts are often normal. About 50% of patients with  PMF have the JAK2 V617F mutation. Bone marrow  aspirate is frequently unsuccessful because the extent  of marrow fibrosis makes aspiration impossible. When  a bone marrow biopsy is performed, it demonstrates  hypercellular marrow with trilineage hyperplasia and  increased number of megakaryocytes with large dysplas- tic nuclei. Interestingly, individuals with PMF often have  associated autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor,  antinuclear antibodies, or positive Coombs test results.  To diagnose someone as having PMF, it must be shown  that he or she does not have another myeloproliferative  disorder or hematologic malignancy that is the cause of  myelofibrosis. The most common disorders that present  in a similar fashion to PMF are polycythemia vera and  chronic myeloid leukemia. Other nonmalignant disor- ders that can cause myelofibrosis include HIV infection,  hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, systemic  lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, and bone marrow  replacement in other cancers such as prostate and breast  cancer. In the patient described here, there is no other  identifiable cause of myelofibrosis; thus, chronic PMF  can be diagnosed.","A. Chronic primary myelofibrosis

The presence of an enlarged spleen, teardrop cells, nucleated red blood cells, immature granulocytes, and a positive rheumatoid factor suggest chronic primary myelofibrosis. This condition is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, leading to ineffective hematopoiesis and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, resulting in splenomegaly. The inability to aspirate cells from the bone marrow biopsy is also consistent with myelofibrosis. Chronic myeloid leukemia would typically present with a markedly elevated white blood cell count and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and tuberculosis are less likely to cause the findings described.",A. Chronic primary myelofibrosis

The latest  complete blood count is white blood cells (WBC),  7000/Î¼L; hematocrit, 34%; and platelets, 600,000/ Î¼L. All the following are common causes of throm- bocytosis EXCEPT: A. Iron-deficiency anemia B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Chronic myeloid leukemia D. Myelodysplasia E. Pernicious anemia","The answer is E. (Chap. 13) Thrombocytosis may be â€œprimaryâ€ or â€œsec- ondary.â€ Essential thrombocytosis is a myeloproliferative  disorder that involves a multipotent hematopoietic pro- genitor cell. Unfortunately, no clonal marker can  reliably  distinguish it from more common nonclonal, reactive  forms of thrombocytosis. Only 50% of patients with  essential (primary) thrombocytosis have the JAK2 V617F  mutation. Therefore, the diagnosis is one of exclusion.  Common causes of secondary thrombocytosis include  infection, inflammatory conditions, malignancy, iron  deficiency, hemorrhage, and postsurgical states. Other  myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myeloid  leukemia and myelofibrosis, may result in thrombocy- tosis. Similarly, myelodysplastic syndromes, particularly  the 5q-syndrome, may cause thrombocytosis. Perni- cious anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency does not  typically cause thrombocytosis. However, correc- tion of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency may  cause a â€œreboundâ€ thrombocytosis. Similarly, cessa- tion of chronic ethanol use may also cause rebound   thrombocytosis.","E. Pernicious anemia

33,"A 38-year-old woman is referred for evaluation  of an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit that  was discovered during an evaluation of recurrent  headaches. Until about 8 months previously, she  was in good health, but she developed increasingly     persistent headaches with intermittent vertigo and   tinnitus. She was originally prescribed sumatriptan  for presumed migraine headaches but did not expe- rience relief of her symptoms. A CT scan of the  brain showed no evidence of mass lesion.  During  evaluation of her headaches, she was found to have a  hemoglobin of 17.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 52%.  Her only other symptom is diffuse itching after hot  showers. She is a nonsmoker. She has no history  pulmonary or cardiac disease. On physical examina- tion, she appears well. Her body mass index is 22.3  kg/m2. Vital signs are blood pressure of 148/84 mm  Hg, heart rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of  12 breaths/min, and SaO2 of 99% on room air. She  is afebrile. The physical examination, including full  neurologic examination, is normal. There are no  heart murmurs. There is no splenomegaly. Periph- eral pulses are normal. Laboratory studies confirm  elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. She also has  a platelet count of 650,000/Î¼L. Leukocyte count  is 12,600/Î¼L with a normal differential. Which of  the following tests should be performed next in the  evaluation of this patient? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Erythropoietin level C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation D. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase E. Red blood cell mass and plasma volume determination","The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) In a patient presenting with an elevated  hemoglobin and hematocrit, the initial step in the evalu- ation is to determine whether erythrocytosis represents a  true elevation in red blood cell (RBC) mass or whether  spurious erythrocytosis is present because of plasma vol- ume contraction. (See Figure 35.) This step may be not  necessary, however, in individuals with hemoglobin >20  g/dL. After absolute erythrocytosis has been determined  by measurement of RBC mass and plasma volume, the  cause of erythrocytosis must be determined. If there is  not an obvious cause of the erythrocytosis, an erythro- poietin level should be checked. An elevated erythropoi- etin level suggests hypoxia or autonomous production of  erythropoietin as the cause of erythrocytosis. However,  a normal erythropoietin level does not exclude hypoxia  as a cause. A low erythropoietin level should be seen in  the myeloproliferative disorder polycythemia vera (PV),  the most likely cause of erythrocytosis in this patient. PV  is often discovered incidentally when elevated hemo- globin is found during testing for other reasons. When  symptoms are present, the most common complaints are  related to hyperviscosity of the blood and include ver- tigo, headache, tinnitus, and transient ischemic attacks.  Patients may also complain of pruritus after showering.  Erythromelalgia is the term give to the symptom complex  of burning, pain, and erythema in the extremities and is  associated with thrombocytosis in PV. Isolated systolic  hypertension and splenomegaly may be found. In addi- tion to elevated red RBC mass and low erythropoietin  levels, other laboratory findings in PV include throm- bocytosis and leukocytosis with abnormal leukocytes  present. Uric acid levels and leukocyte alkaline phos- phatase may be elevated but are not diagnostic for PV.  Approximately 30% of individuals with PV are homo- zygous for the JAK2 V617F mutation, and >90% are  heterozygous for this mutation. This mutation located  on the short arm of chromosome 9 causes constitutive  activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) protein, a tyrosine  kinase that renders erythrocytes resistant to apoptosis  and allows them to continue production independently  from erythropoietin. However, not every patient with  PV expresses this mutation, and approximately 50% of  patients with chronic myelofibrosis and essential throm- bocytosis express this mutation. Thus, it is not recom- mended as an initial diagnostic test for PV but may be  used for confirmatory purposes. Bone marrow biopsy  provides no specific information in PV and is not rec- ommended.  Review and Self-Assessment 762","C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation

This patient's presentation is concerning for polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, as well as elevated platelet count. The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera, making genetic testing for this mutation an important next step in the evaluation of this patient. Bone marrow biopsy may also be considered to confirm the diagnosis, but genetic testing for the JAK2 V617F mutation is a less invasive and more specific test for this condition. Erythropoietin level may be low in polycythemia vera, but it is not specific for the diagnosis. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is not typically elevated in polycythemia vera. Red blood cell mass and plasma volume determination may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, but genetic testing for the JAK2 V617F mutation is a more specific test.",C.

Trisomy 12  Review and Self-Assessment 732","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) This patient presents with typical findings of  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which has an inci- dence of 1.5 per 100,000 people yearly. The typical age  of onset is in the mid forties, and there is a slight male  predominance. Half of individuals are asymptomatic at  the time of diagnosis. If symptoms are present, they are  typically nonspecific and include fatigue and weight loss.  Occasionally, patients have symptoms related to splenic  enlargement such as early satiety and left upper quad- rant pain. Laboratory findings are suggestive of CML.  A high leukocyte count of 100,000/Î¼L is typical, with  a predominant granulocytic differential, including neu- trophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and band forms.  The circulating blast count should be <5%. Anemia and  thrombocytosis are also common. The bone marrow  demonstrates nonspecific increase in cellularity with an  increase in the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio. The diagnosis  of CML is established by identifying a clonal expansion  of a hematopoietic stem cell possessing a reciprocal trans- location between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translo- cation results in the head-to-tail fusion of the breakpoint  cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11 with  the ABL1 (named after the Abelson murine leukemia  virus) gene located on chromosome 9q34. The bcr-abl  fusion protein results in constitutive activation of abl  tyrosine kinase enzyme that prevents apoptosis and leads  to increased survival of the cells containing the muta- tion.

The deletion of the long arm  of chromosome 5 is present in some individuals with  acute myeloid leukemias and is associated with older age  at diagnosis. The inversion of chromosome 16 is typi- cally present in acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4  subtype). The translocation of the long arms of chromo- somes 15 and 17 is the mutation associated with acute  promyelocytic anemia that results in arrest of cellular dif- ferentiation that can be treated with pharmacologic doses  of ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid).

This patient likely has chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells. Deletion of a portion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del(5q)) is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome, inversion of chromosome 16 (inv(16)) is associated with acute myeloid leukemia, translocations of the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17 are associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, and trisomy 12 is associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",C.

C. Men have a higher incidence of acute myeloid leu- kemia than women. D. The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia is greatest  in individuals younger than 20 years of age. E. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is associated with an  increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia.","The answer is D.  (Chap. 14) The acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are a  group of hematologic malignancies derived from hema- tologic stem cells that have acquired chromosomal muta- tions that prevent differentiation into mature myeloid  cells. The specific chromosomal abnormalities predict  in which stage of differentiation the cell is arrested and  are associated with the several subtypes of AML that  have been identified. In the United States, >16,000  new cases of AML are diagnosed yearly, and the num- bers of new cases of AML has increased in the past   10 years. Men are diagnosed with AML more frequently  than women (4.6 cases per 100,000 population vs 3.0  cases per 100,000, respectively). In addition, older age  is associated with increased incidence of AML, with an  incidence of 18.6 cases per 100,000 population in those  older than 65 years of age. AML is uncommon in adoles- cents. Other known risk factors for the development of  AML include hereditary genetic abnormalities, radiation  and chemical exposures, and drugs. The most common  hereditary abnormality linked to AML is trisomy 21  (Down syndrome). Other hereditary syndromes associ- ated with an increase of AML include diseases associated  with defective DNA repair such as Fanconiâ€™s anemia  and ataxia telangiectasia. Survivors of the atomic bomb  explosions in Japan were found to have a high incidence  of AML as have survivors of other high-dose radiation  exposures. However, therapeutic radiation is not associ- ated with an increased risk of AML unless the patient  was also treated concomitantly with alkylating agents.  Anticancer drugs are the most common causes of drug- associated AML.

She has no  siblings. What is the best initial therapy for this   patient? A. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant B. Autologous stem cell transplant C. Imatinib mesylate D. Interferon-Î± E. Leukapheresis","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) The goal of therapy in chronic myeloid leu- kemia (CML) is to achieve prolonged, durable, non- neoplastic, nonclonal hematopoiesis, which entails the  eradication of any residual cells containing the BCR- ABL1 transcript. Hence, the goal is complete molecular  remission and cure. Therapy of CML has changed in  recent years because of the presence of a proven curative   Review and Self-Assessment 763 treatment (allogeneic transplantation) that has significant  toxicity and a targeted treatment (imatinib) with out- standing outcome based on 8-year follow-up data. New  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are becoming available, mak- ing this a dynamic topic. Many experts currently recom- mend initiating therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and reserving allogeneic transplantation for those who  develop drug resistance. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine  kinase inhibitor that acts to decrease the activity of the  bcr-abl fusion protein that results from the recipro- cal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadel- phia chromosome). It acts as a competitive inhibitor of  the abl kinase at its ATP binding site and thus leads to  inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in  bcr-abl signal transduction. In newly diagnosed CML,  imatinib results in a complete hematologic remission in  95% of patients initially and 76% at 18 months. Low- risk patients have a higher durable remission rate. All  imatinib-treated patients who achieved major molecular  remission (26%), defined as 3 log or greater reduction  in BCR-ABL1 transcript level at 18 months compared  with pretreatment level, were progression free at 5 years.  There is a consensus that molecular responses can be  used as a treatment goal in CML. Imatinib, taken orally,  has limited side effects that include nausea, fluid reten- tion, diarrhea, and skin rash and is usually well tolerated.  Interferon-Î± was previously the first-line chemotherapy  if bone marrow transplant was not an option, but it has  been replaced by imatinib mesylate. Autologous stem cell  transplant is not currently used for treatment of CML  because there is no reliable way to select residual normal  hematopoietic progenitor cells. Leukopheresis is used for  control of leukocyte counts when the patient is experi- encing complications such as respiratory failure or cere- bral ischemia related to the high white blood cell count.","C. Imatinib mesylate

Imatinib mesylate is the first-line therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia, particularly for patients who are asymptomatic with high leukocyte counts and low blast percentages. It is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the abnormal BCR-ABL fusion protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant may be considered in younger patients with high-risk disease, but it is not typically the first-line therapy. Autologous stem cell transplant is not typically used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Interferon-α may be used in certain cases, but imatinib is generally preferred due to its higher efficacy and better tolerability. Leukapheresis may be used as a temporary measure to reduce leukocyte counts in patients with symptomatic leukostasis, but it is not a long-term treatment option.",C. Imatinib mesylate

Laboratory examination reveals the following:  hemoglobin, 5.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 15%; platelets,  12,000/Î¼L; and white blood cell (WBC) count,  168,000/Î¼L with 45% blast forms, 30% neutrophils,  20% lymphocytes, and 5% monocytes. Review of  the peripheral blood smear confirms acute myeloid  leukemia (M1 subtype, myeloblastic leukemia with- out maturation) with complex chromosomal abnor- malities on cytogenetics. All of the following confer  a poor prognosis for this patient EXCEPT: A. Advanced age B. Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics  Review and Self-Assessment 733 C. Hemoglobin below 7 g/dL D. Prolonged interval between symptom onset and  diagnosis E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) Patients with acute leukemia frequently pres- ent with nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and weight  loss. In addition, weight loss and anorexia are also com- mon. About half have had symptoms for >3 months at  the time of presentation. Fever is present in only about  10% of patients at presentation, and 5% have evidence of  abnormal hemostasis. On physical examination, hepato- megaly, splenomegaly, sternal tenderness, and evidence  of infection or hemorrhage are common presenting signs.  Laboratory studies are confirmatory with evidence of  anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis often pres- ent. The median presenting leukocyte count at presenta- tion is 15,000/Î¼L. About 20â€“40% have presenting leu- kocyte counts <5000/Î¼L, and another 20% have counts  >100,000/Î¼L. Review of the peripheral smear confirms  leukemia in most cases. If Auer rods are seen, the diagno- sis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is virtually certain.  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/Î¼L) is seen  in >75% of individuals with AML. After the diagnosis  of AML has been confirmed, rapid evaluation and treat- ment should be undertaken. The general health of the  cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems  should be evaluated because chemotherapy has adverse  effects that may cause organ dysfunction in any of these  systems. Overall, chromosome findings at diagnosis are  currently the most important independent prognostic   factor. Patients with t(15;17) have a very good prognosis    Review and Self-Assessment 764 (~85% cured), and those with t(8;21) and inv(16) have a  good prognosis (~55% cured), but those with no cytoge- netic abnormality have a moderately favorable outcome  (~40% cured). Patients with a complex karyotype, t(6;9),  inv(3), or â€“7, have a very poor prognosis. Among the  prognostic factors that predict poor outcomes in AML,  age at diagnosis is one of the most important because indi- viduals of advanced age tolerate induction chemotherapy  poorly. In addition, advanced age is more likely to be  associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities that  predict poorer response to chemotherapy, although some  chromosomal markers predict a better response to che- motherapy. Poor performance status independent of age  also decreases survival in AML. Responsiveness to chemo- therapy and survival are also worse if the leukocyte count  is >100,000/Î¼L or the antecedent course of symptoms  is prolonged. Anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytope- nia present for >3 months is a poor prognostic indicator.  However, there is no absolute degree of anemia or throm- bocytopenia that predicts worse outcomes.","B. Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics

Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The other factors listed, such as advanced age, low hemoglobin levels, and a prolonged interval between symptom onset and diagnosis, are all associated with a poor prognosis in this patient. A high white blood cell count above 100,000/μL is also associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.","The poor prognosis factors for the patient with acute myeloid leukemia (M1 subtype) with complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics include advanced age, complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics, hemoglobin below 7 g/dL, and a prolonged interval between symptom onset and diagnosis. The factor that does not confer a poor prognosis for this patient is a white blood cell (WBC) count above 100,000/μL."
38,The evaluation in a newly diagnosed case of acute  lymphoid leukemia should routinely include all of  the following EXCEPT: A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Cell-surface phenotyping C. Cytogenetic testing D. Lumbar puncture E. Plasma viscosity,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 15) Viscosity testing is typically reserved for cases  of multiple myeloma in which paraproteins (particularly  immunoglobulin M) can lead to vascular sludging and  subsequent tissue ischemia. Acute lymphoid leukemia  (ALL) can lead to end-organ abnormalities in the kidney  and liver; therefore, routine chemistry tests are indicated.  A lumbar puncture must be performed in cases of newly  diagnosed ALL to rule out spread of disease to the central  nervous system. Bone marrow biopsy reveals the degree  of marrow infiltration and is often necessary for classifica- tion of the tumor. Immunologic cell-surface marker test- ing often identifies the cell lineage involved and the type  of tumor, information that is often impossible to discern  from morphologic interpretation alone. Cytogenetic test- ing provides prognostic information on the disease natu- ral history. In ALL, the prognosis depends on the genetic  characteristics of the tumor, the patientâ€™s age, the white  blood cell count, and the patientâ€™s overall clinical status and  major organ function.","E.

Plasma viscosity is not typically included in the routine evaluation of a newly diagnosed case of acute lymphoid leukemia. It is not a standard test used in the diagnosis or monitoring of this type of leukemia.",D. Lumbar puncture
39,All of the following infectious agents have been  associated with development of a lymphoid malig- nancy EXCEPT: A. Helicobacter pylori B. Hepatitis B C. Hepatitis C D. HIV E. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8),"The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Hepatitis B and C are both common causes  of cirrhosis and are strongly associated with the devel- opment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C, but  not hepatitis B, can also lead to a lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma, often in the spleen, that resolves with cure  of hepatitis C. Epstein-Barr virus has been associated  with a large number of lymphoid malignancies, includ- ing posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD),  Hodgkinâ€™s disease, central nervous system lymphoma,  and Burkittâ€™s lymphoma. Helicobacter pylori infection is  necessary and sufficient for gastric mucosa-associated  lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma development, and  cure can be achieved with eradication of the organism in  some cases. HHV8 is a known cause of body cavity lym- phoma, including primary pleural lymphoma. In addi- tion to those listed, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1  is associated with adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia.  Other disorders associated with lymphoma include  celiac sprue, autoimmune disease, and biologic therapies  for autoimmune disease. Celiac sprue has been associated  with gastrointestinal tract lymphoma. Many collagen  vascular diseases (e.g., Sjogrenâ€™s disease) and antiâ€“tumor  necrosis factor therapies have been associated with the  development of lymphoma.",A. Helicobacter pylori,A.

40,"A 64-year-old man with chronic lymphoid leuke- mia and chronic hepatitis C presents for his yearly  follow-up. His white blood cell count is stable at  83,000/Î¼L, but his hematocrit has dropped from  35â€“26%, and his platelet count also dropped from  178,000/Î¼L to 69,000/Î¼L. His initial evaluation  should include all of the following EXCEPT: A. AST, ALT, and prothrombin time B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Coombs test D. Peripheral blood smear E. Physical examination","The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and throm- bocytopenia are common, and a peripheral blood smear  and a Coombs test help evaluate their presence. Hyper- splenism is also seen in chronic lymphoid leukemia  (CLL) as the spleen sequesters large numbers of circulat- ing blood cells and enlarges. Hence, a careful left upper  quadrant examination looking for a palpable splenic tip  is the standard of care in this situation. This patient is at  risk of hepatic decompensation as well, given his hepati- tis C that can also cause anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Bone marrow infiltration of tumor cells can lead to cyto- penias in CLL. However, this is in effect a diagnosis of  exclusion. After these three possibilities have been ruled  out, a bone marrow biopsy is a reasonable next step.  This initial evaluation before presuming spread of CLL is  critical for therapy because each possibility requires dif- ferent therapy (glucocorticoids or rituximab for hemoly- sis, hepatology referral for liver failure, and splenectomy  for symptomatic hypersplenism).","B. Bone marrow biopsy

Bone marrow biopsy is not typically indicated in the initial evaluation of a patient with chronic lymphoid leukemia and chronic hepatitis C presenting with a drop in hematocrit and platelet count. The other options (AST, ALT, and prothrombin time, Coombs test, peripheral blood smear, and physical examination) are more appropriate initial tests to assess for potential causes of the drop in hematocrit and platelet count.",B.

A complete blood count is notable  for a white cell count of 88,000 with 99% lympho- cytes. A peripheral smear is shown in Figure 45.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  A. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia B. Acute myelogenous leukemia C. Chronic lymphocytic lymphoma D. Hairy cell leukemia E. Mononucleosis","The answer is C.  (Chap. 15) The peripheral smear shows increased num- bers of small, well-differentiated, normal-appearing  lymphocytes characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leu- kemia, the most common leukemia or lymphoma in  adults. Common presenting complaints typically include  fatigue, frequent infections, new lymphadenopathy, and  abdominal complaints relating to splenomegaly. Hairy  cell leukemia is a rare disease that presents predominantly  in older men. The typical presentation involves pancyto- penia, although occasional patients will have a leukemic  presentation. Splenomegaly is usual. The malignant cells  appear to have â€œhairyâ€ projections on light and elec- tron microscopy. Patients with this disorder are prone to  unusual infections, including infection by Mycobacterium  avium intracellulare, and to vasculitic syndromes. Hairy cell  leukemia is responsive to chemotherapy with cladrib- ine with clinical complete remissions in the majority of  patients and frequent long-term disease-free survival.","C. Chronic lymphocytic lymphoma

The presentation of fatigue, abdominal fullness, bilateral axillary adenopathy, and an enlarged spleen, along with a high white cell count with predominantly lymphocytes, is consistent with chronic lymphocytic lymphoma. Additionally, the peripheral smear showing mature-appearing lymphocytes with smudge cells is characteristic of chronic lymphocytic lymphoma.",The most likely diagnosis based on the provided information is Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL).

Nodular sclerosing Hodgkinâ€™s disease,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 15) Classical Hodgkinâ€™s disease carries a better  prognosis than all types of non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma.   Review and Self-Assessment 765 Patients with good prognostic factors can achieve cure  with extended field radiation alone, but those with a  higher risk disease often achieve cure with high-dose  chemotherapy and sometimes radiation.

FIGURE 45 FIGURE 47  Review and Self-Assessment 734 A. Burkittâ€™s lymphoma B. Cat scratch disease C. CMV infection D. Hodgkinâ€™s disease E. Non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma","The answer is D.  (Chap. 15) The large cell with a bilobed nucleus and  prominent nucleoli giving an â€œowlâ€™s eyesâ€ appearance  near the center of the field is a Reed-Sternberg cell, con- firming the diagnosis of Hodgkinâ€™s disease. Hodgkinâ€™s  disease occurs in 8000 patients in the United States  each year, and the disease does not appear to be increas- ing in frequency. Most patients present with palpable  lymphadenopathy that is nontender; in most patients,  these lymph nodes are in the neck, supraclavicular area,  and axilla. More than half the patients have mediasti- nal adenopathy at diagnosis, and this is sometimes the  initial manifestation. A subdiaphragmatic presentation of  Hodgkinâ€™s disease is unusual and more common in older  men. One-third of patients present with fevers, night  sweats, or weight loss, which are B symptoms in the  Ann Arbor staging classification. Occasionally, Hodg- kinâ€™s disease can present as a fever of unknown origin.  This is more common in older patients who are found to  have mixed cellularity Hodgkinâ€™s disease in an abdomi- nal site. Rarely, the fevers persist for days to weeks fol- lowed by afebrile intervals and then recurrence of the  fever (Pel-Ebstein fever).

44,All of the following statements regarding mastocy- tosis are true EXCEPT: A. Elevated serum tryptase suggests aggressive   disease. B. Eosinophilia is common. C. It is often associated with myeloid neoplasm. D. More than 90% of cases are confined to the skin. E. Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common clinical  manifestation.,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 16) Mastocytosis is a proliferation and accumula- tion of mast cells in one or more organ systems. Only  the skin is involved in approximately 80% of cases with  the other 20% being defined as systemic mastocytosis  caused by the involvement of another organ system. The  most common manifestation of mastocytosis is cutaneous  urticaria pigmentosa, a maculopapular pigmented rash  involving the papillary dermis. Other cutaneous forms  include diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (almost entirely  in children) and mastocytoma. Clinical manifestations of  systemic mastocytosis are related to either cellular infil- tration of organs or release of histamine, proteases, eico- sanoids, or heparin from mast cells. Therefore, signs and  symptoms may include constitutional symptoms, skin  manifestations (pruritus, dermatographia, rash), medi- ator-related symptoms (abdominal pain, flushing, syn- cope, hypertension, diarrhea), and bone-related symp- toms (fracture, pain, arthralgia). In a recent series, 40%  of patients with systemic mastocytosis had an associated  myeloid neoplasm, most commonly myeloproliferative  syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplas- tic syndrome. Eosinophilia was present in approximately  one-third of patients. Elevated serum tryptase, bone mar- row involvement, splenomegaly, skeletal involvement,  cytopenia, and malabsorption predict more aggressive  disease and a worse prognosis. Many patients with sys- temic mastocytosis have an activating mutation of c-Kit,  a kinase inhibited by imatinib; however, the mutation  appears relatively resistant to this agent.",B. Eosinophilia is common.,D. More than 90% of cases are confined to the skin.
45,"A 58-year-old man is evaluated in the emergency  department for sudden onset cough with yellow  sputum production and dyspnea. Aside from sys- temic hypertension, he is otherwise healthy. His  only medication is amlodipine. Chest radiograph  shows a right upper lobe alveolar infiltrate, and  laboratory test results are notable for a blood urea  nitrogen of 53 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, cal- cium of 12.3 mg/dL, total protein of 9 g/dL, and  albumin of 3.1 g/dL. Sputum culture grows Strep- tococcus pneumonia. Which of the following tests will  confirm the underlying condition predisposing him  to pneumococcal pneumonia? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and  pelvis with contrast C. HIV antibody D. Sweat chloride testing E. Videoscopic swallow study","The answer is A.  (Chap. 17) The patient presents with pneumococcal  pneumonia and evidence of hypercalcemia, renal fail- ure, and a wide protein gap suggestive of an M pro- tein. These findings are classic for multiple myeloma.  Although the patient appears to be making large quan- tities of immunoglobulins, they are in fact generally  monoclonal, and patients actually have functional hypo- gammaglobulinemia related to both decreased produc- tion and increased destruction of normal antibodies. This  hypogammaglobulinemia predisposes patients to infec- tions, most commonly pneumonia with pneumococcus  or Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative pyelonephritis.  Bone marrow biopsy would confirm the presence of  clonal plasma cells and define the quantity, which will  help define treatment options. A serum protein electro- phoresis would also be indicated to prove the presence  of the M protein suspected by the wide protein gap.  Although HIV may be associated with kidney injury,  both acute and chronic, hypercalcemia would be an  unusual feature. There is no clinical history of aspira- tion, and the location of infiltrate, upper lobe, is unusual  for aspiration. Sweat chloride testing is not indicated  because there is no suspicion for cystic fibrosis. Because  solid organ malignancy is not suspected, computed  tomography of the body is unlikely to be helpful.","C. HIV antibody

This patient presents with pneumococcal pneumonia and has laboratory findings suggestive of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and proteinuria, which are consistent with hyperparathyroidism. HIV infection is a known risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia, so testing for HIV antibodies would be appropriate in this case.",A. Bone marrow biopsy
46,"A 64-year-old African American man is evaluated in  the hospital for congestive heart failure, renal failure,  and polyneuropathy. Physical examination on admis- sion was notable for these findings and raised waxy  papules in the axilla and inguinal region. Admission  laboratories showed a blood urea nitrogen of 90 mg/ dL and a creatinine of 6.3 mg/dL. Total protein  was 9.0 g/dL with an albumin of 3.2 g/dL. Hema- tocrit was 24%, and white blood cell and platelet  counts were normal. Urinalysis was remarkable for  3+ proteinuria but no cellular casts. Further evalu- ation included an echocardiogram with a thickened  left ventricle and preserved systolic function. Which  of the following tests is most likely to diagnose the  underlying condition? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Electromyogram (EMG) with nerve conduction  studies C. Fat pad biopsy D. Right heart catheterization E. Renal ultrasonography","The answer is A.  (Chap. 18) This patient presents with a multisystem ill- ness involving the heart, kidneys, and peripheral ner- vous system. The physical examination is suggestive of  amyloidosis with classic waxy papules in the folds of his  body. The laboratory test results are remarkable for renal  failure of unclear etiology with significant proteinuria  but no cellular casts. A possible etiology of the renal   failure is suggested by the elevated gamma globulin frac- tion and low hematocrit, bringing to mind a monoclo- nal gammopathy perhaps leading to renal failure through  amyloid AL deposition. This could also account for the   Review and Self-Assessment 766 enlarged heart seen on the echocardiography and the  peripheral neuropathy. The fat pad biopsy is generally  reported to be 60â€“80% sensitive for amyloid; how- ever, it would not allow a diagnosis of this patientâ€™s  likely myeloma. A right heart catheterization probably  would prove that the patient has restrictive cardiomy- opathy secondary to amyloid deposition; however, it too  would not diagnose the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.  Renal ultrasonography, although warranted to rule out  obstructive uropathy, would not be diagnostic. Simi- larly, the electromyographic and nerve conduction stud- ies would not be diagnostic. The bone marrow biopsy is  about 50â€“60% sensitive for amyloid, but it would allow  evaluation of the percent of plasma cells in the bone  marrow and allow the diagnosis of multiple myeloma to  be made. Multiple myeloma is associated with amyloid  AL in approximately 20% of cases. Light chains most  commonly deposit systemically in the heart, kidneys,  liver, and nervous system, causing organ dysfunction. In  these organs, biopsy would show the classic eosinophilic  material that, when exposed to Congo red stain, has a  characteristic apple-green birefringence.","C. Fat pad biopsy

The patient's presentation with congestive heart failure, renal failure, polyneuropathy, and waxy papules in the axilla and inguinal region is suggestive of systemic amyloidosis. Fat pad biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to diagnose amyloidosis by identifying amyloid deposits in the tissue. This test is often used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests such as serum and urine protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis.",C.

47,"A 75-year-old man is hospitalized for treatment of  a deep-vein thrombosis. He had recently been dis- charged from the hospital about 2 months ago. At  that time, he had been treated for community- acquired pneumonia complicated by acute respira- tory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He  was hospitalized for 21 days at that time and had dis- charged from a rehabilitation 2 weeks ago. On the  day before admission, he developed painful swelling  of his left lower extremity. Lower extremity Doppler  ultrasonography confirmed an occlusive thrombus  of his deep femoral vein. After an initial bolus, he  is started on a continuous infusion of unfractionated  heparin at 1600 U/hr because he has end-stage renal  disease on hemodialysis. His activated partial throm- boplastin time is maintained in the therapeutic range.  On day 5, it is noted that his platelets have fallen from  150,000/Î¼L to 88,000/Î¼L. What is the most appro- priate action at this time? A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and  assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. B. Stop all anticoagulation while awaiting results of  anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. C. Stop heparin infusion and initiate argatroban. D. Stop heparin infusion and initiate enoxaparin. E. Stop heparin infusion and initiate lepirudin.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 19) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is  a clinical diagnosis that must not be missed because life- threatening thrombosis can occur if not treated appro- priately. The cause of HIT is the formation of antibodies  to the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4).  This complex is able to activate platelets, monocytes,  and endothelial cells. Many patients exposed to heparin  will develop antibodies to the heparinâ€“PF4 complex, but  only a few of these will progress to develop thrombocy- topenia or thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT).  The typical patient will develop evidence of HIT 5 to  14 days after exposure to heparin, although it can occur  within 5 days in individuals exposed to heparin within  about the previous 100 days as would be expected in this  patient given his recent hospitalization. The nadir platelet  count is typically >20,000/Î¼L. When HIT is suspected,  one should not delay treatment for laboratory testing  because no currently available test has adequate sensitiv- ity or specificity for the diagnosis. The antiheparin/PF4  antibody test result is positive in many individuals who  have been exposed to heparin regardless of whether HIT  is present. The platelet activation assay is more specific  but less sensitive for HIT. As soon as HIT is suspected,  heparin should be discontinued and replaced with an  alternative form of anticoagulation to protect against  development of new thromboses. Low-molecular-weight  heparins (LMWHs) such as enoxaparin are not appropri- ate treatment options in individuals with HIT. Although   heparin is 10 times more likely to cause HIT, LMWHs  also cause the illness and should not be used. The primary  agents used for HIT in the United States are the direct  thrombin inhibitors argatroban and lepirudin. Argatroban  is the preferred agent for this patient because of his renal  failure. The drug is not excreted by the kidneys, and  no dosage adjustment is required. In contrast, lepirudin  is markedly increased in renal failure, and a significant  dosage adjustment is required. Danaparoid has previ- ously been used frequently for HIT and HITT, but this  medication is no longer available in the United States.  Other anticoagulants that are used for treatment of HITT  include bivalirudin and fondaparinux, but these also are  not currently approved for use in the United States.","A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies.

This patient is experiencing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a rare but serious complication of heparin therapy. The most appropriate action at this time is to continue the heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies. If the antibodies are positive, heparin should be stopped immediately and an alternative anticoagulant such as argatroban, enoxaparin, or lepirudin should be initiated.",C. Stop heparin infusion and initiate argatroban.
48,"A 48-year-old woman is evaluated by her primary  care physician for a complaint of gingival bleed- ing and easy bruising. She has noted the problem  for about 2 months. Initially, she attributed it to  aspirin that she was taking intermittently for head- aches, but she stopped all aspirin and nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drug use 6 weeks ago. Her only  medical history is an automobile accident 12 years  previously that caused a liver laceration. It required  surgical repair, and she did receive several transfu- sions of red blood cells and platelets at that time.  She currently takes no prescribed medications and  otherwise feels well. On physical examination, she  appears well and healthy. She has no jaundice or  scleral icterus. Her cardiac and pulmonary exami- nation results are normal. The abdominal examina- tion shows a liver span of 12 cm to percussion, and  the edge is palpable 1.5 cm below the right costal  Review and Self-Assessment 735    margin. The spleen tip is not palpable. There are  petechiae present on her extremities and hard pal- ate with a few small ecchymoses on her extremities.  A complete blood count shows a hemoglobin of  12.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 37.6%, white blood cell  count of 8400/Î¼L with a normal differential, and a  platelet count of 7500/Î¼L. What tests are indicated  for the workup of this patientâ€™s thrombocytopenia? A. Antiplatelet antibodies B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Hepatitis C antibody D. Human immunodeficiency antibody E. C and D F. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 19) This patient presents with symptoms of  thrombocytopenia, including bleeding gums and easy  bruising. The only finding on physical examination  may be petechiae at points of increased venous pressure,  especially in the feet and ankles. The laboratory findings  confirm thrombocytopenia but show no abnormalities in  other cell lines. When evaluating isolated thrombocyto- penia, one must initially consider whether an underlying  infection or medication is causing the platelet count to  fall. There is a long list of medications that are implicated  in thrombocytopenia, including aspirin, acetaminophen,  penicillins, H2 blockers, heparin, and many others. This  patient discontinued all medications over 6 weeks pre- viously, and the platelet count would be expected to  recover if a medication reaction were the cause. She  gives no signs of any acute infection. Thus, the most  likely diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenia purpura  (ITP). This disorder is also known as idiopathic throm- bocytopenia purpura and refers to an immune-mediated  destruction of platelets and possible inhibition of plate- let release from megakaryocytes. ITP can truly be idio- pathic, or it can be secondary to an underlying disorder,  including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV, or  chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The platelet  count can be quite low (<5000/Î¼L) in patients with ITP  and usually presents with mucocutaneous bleeding. Lab- oratory testing for ITP should include a peripheral smear  that typically demonstrates large platelets with other- wise normal morphology. Initial testing should evaluate  for secondary causes of ITP, including HIV antibodies,  HCV antibodies, serologic testing for SLE, serum pro- tein electrophoresis, and immunoglobulins. If anemia is  also present, a direct Coombs test is indicated to assess  whether there is a combined autoimmune hemolytic  anemia with ITP (Evans syndrome). Antiplatelet anti- body testing is not recommended because these tests  have low sensitivity and specificity for ITP. In addition,  bone marrow biopsy is typically not performed unless  there are other abnormalities that are not explained by  ITP or the patient has failed to respond to usual therapy.","F. All of the above

Thrombocytopenia can have various causes, so it is important to perform a thorough workup to determine the underlying cause. In this case, the patient has a history of a liver laceration and transfusions, which could be contributing factors. Testing for antiplatelet antibodies, performing a bone marrow biopsy, and checking for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency antibodies can help identify the cause of the thrombocytopenia.",B.

49,Which of the following statements regarding  hemophilia A and B is TRUE? A. Individuals with factor VIII deficiency have a more  severe  clinical course than those with factor IX deficiency. B. Levels of factor VIII or IX need to be measured  before administration of replacement therapy in pa- tients presenting with acute bleeding to calculate the  appropriate dose of factor. C. Primary prophylaxis against bleeding is never indicated. D. The goal level of factor VIII or IX is >50% in the set- ting of large-volume bleeding episodes. E. The life expectancy of individuals with hemophilia is  about 50 years.,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) The hemophilias are X-linked inherited dis- orders that cause deficiency of factor VIII (hemophilia A)  or factor 9 (hemophilia B). The hemophilias affect about  1 in 10,000 males worldwide with hemophilia A respon- sible for 80% of cases. Clinically, there is no difference  between hemophilia A and B. The disease presentation  largely depends on the residual activity of factor VIII or  factor IX. Severe disease is typically seen when factor  activity is <1%, and moderate disease appears when the   levels range between 1% and 5%. The clinical manifesta- tion of moderate and severe disease is commonly bleed- ing into the joints, soft tissues, and  muscles that occurs  after  minimal trauma or even spontaneously. When fac- tor activity is >25%, bleeding would occur only after  major trauma or surgery, and the diagnosis may not be  made unless a prolonged activated partial thromboplas- tin time is seen on routine laboratory examination. To  make a definitive diagnosis, one would need to mea- sure specific levels of factor VIII and IX. Without treat- ment, life expectancy is limited, but given the changes in  therapy since the 1980s, the life span is about 65 years.  Early treatment of hemophilia required the use of pooled  plasma that was used to make factor concentrates. Given  the large number of donors required to generate the fac- tor concentrates and the frequent need for transfusion  in some individuals, bloodborne pathogens such as HIV  and hepatitis C are among the leading cause of death in  patients with hemophilia. In the 1990s, recombinant fac- tor VIII and IX were developed. Primary prophylaxis is  given to individuals with baseline factor activity levels of  <1% to prevent spontaneous bleeding, especially hemar- throses. Although this strategy is highly recommended,  only about 50% of eligible patients receive prophylactic  therapy because of the high costs and need for regular  intravenous infusions. When an individual is suspected  of having a bleed, the treatment should begin as soon  as possible and not delayed until factor activity levels  return. Factor concentrates should be given to raise the  activity level to 50% for large hematomas or deep muscle  bleeds, and an individual may require treatment for a  period of 7 days or more. For milder bleeds, including  uncomplicated hemarthrosis, the goal factor activity level  is 30â€“50% with maintenance of levels between 15% and  25% for 2 to 3 days after the initial transfusions. In addi- tion to treatment with factor concentrates, care should  be taken to avoid medications that inhibit platelet func- tion. DDAVP, a desmopressin analogue, can be given as  adjunctive therapy for acute bleeding episodes in hemo- philia A because this may cause a transient rise in factor  VIII levels and von Willebrand factor because of release  from endothelial cells. This medication is typically only  useful in mild to moderate disease. Antifibrinolytic drugs  such as tranexamic acid or Îµ-amino caproic acid are help- ful in promoting hemostasis for mucosal bleeding.",A.

50,"A 24-year-old man is admitted to the hospital  with circulatory collapse in the setting of dissemi- nated meningococcemia. He is currently intu- bated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. He  has received over 6 L of intravenous saline in the  past 6 hours but remains hypotensive, requiring  treatment with norepinephrine and vasopressin at  maximum doses. He is making <20 mL of urine  each hour. Blood is noted to be oozing from all  FIGURE 53  Review and Self-Assessment 736    of IV sites. His endotracheal secretions are blood  tinged. His laboratory studies show a white blood  cell count of 24,300/Î¼L (82% neutrophils, 15%  bands, 3% lymphocytes), hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL,  hematocrit of 26.1%, and platelets of 19,000/Î¼L.  The international normalized ratio is 3.6, the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time is 75 seconds, and  fibrinogen is 42 mg/dL. The lactate dehydrogenase  level is 580 U/L, and the haptoglobin is <10 mg/dL.   The peripheral smear shows thrombocytopenia and  schistocytes.

Platelets","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  is a consumptive coagulopathy that is characterized by  diffuse intravascular fibrin formation that overcomes the  bodyâ€™s natural anticoagulant mechanisms. DIC is most  commonly associated with sepsis, trauma, or malignancy  or in obstetric complications. The pathogenesis of DIC  is not completely elucidated, but it involves intravascular  exposure to phospholipids from damaged tissue, hemo- lysis, and endothelial damage. This leads to stimulation of  procoagulant pathways with uncontrolled thrombin gen- eration and microvascular ischemia. A secondary hyper- fibrinolysis subsequently occurs. The primary  clinical   Review and Self-Assessment 768 manifestations of DIC are bleeding at venipuncture sites,  petechiae, and ecchymoses. Severe gastrointestinal and  pulmonary hemorrhage can occur. The clinical diagnosis  of DIC is based on laboratory findings in the appropri- ate clinical setting, such as severe sepsis. Although there  is no single test for DIC, the common constellation of  findings is thrombocytopenia (<100,000/Î¼L), elevated  prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplas- tin time, evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mia, and elevated fibrin degradation productions and  d-dimer. The fibrinogen level may be <100 mg/dL but  often does not decrease acutely unless the DIC is very  severe. The primary treatment of DIC is to treat the  underlying cause, which in this case would be antibiotic  therapy directed against Neisseria meningitidis. For patients  such as this one who are experiencing bleeding related to  the DIC, attempts to correct the coagulopathy should be  undertaken. Platelet transfusions and fresh-frozen plasma  (FFP) should be given. In addition, cryoprecipitate is  indicated as the fibrinogen level is <100 mg/dL. In gen- eral, 10 U of cryoprecipitate are required for every 2 to  3 units of FFP. In acute DIC, heparin is not been dem- onstrated to be helpful and may increase bleeding. Low- dose heparin therapy (5â€“10 U/kg) is used for chronic  low-grade DIC such as that seen in acute promyelocytic  leukemia or removal of a dead fetus.","D. Heparin

Heparin is not indicated in this patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as it can worsen bleeding by further depleting coagulation factors. The patient is already at risk for bleeding due to low platelets and abnormal coagulation studies. The other treatments listed (ceftriaxone, cryoprecipitate, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets) are all indicated in the management of DIC.",The treatment not indicated in this patient is D. Heparin.
51,All the following are vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagu- lation factors EXCEPT: A. Factor X B. Factor VII C. Protein C D. Protein S E. Factor VIII,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays  an essential role in hemostasis. It is absorbed in the small  intestine and stored in the liver. It serves as a cofactor in  the enzymatic carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on  prothrombin-complex proteins. The three major causes  of vitamin K deficiency are poor dietary intake, intesti- nal malabsorption, and liver disease. The prothrombin  complex proteins (factors II, VII, IX, and X and protein  C and protein S) all decrease with vitamin K deficiency.  Factor VII and protein C have the shortest half-lives  of these factors and therefore decrease first. Therefore,  vitamin K deficiency manifests with prolongation of the  prothrombin time first. With severe deficiency, the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time will be prolonged as  well. Factor VIII is not influenced by vitamin K.",E. Factor VIII,C. Protein C

Plasmapheresis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Hemophilia A results from a deficiency of  factor VIII. Replacement of factor VIII is the center- piece of treatment. Cessation of aspirin or nonsteroi- dal anti-inflammatory drugs is highly recommended.  Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains pooled plasma from  human sources. Cryoprecipitate refers to FFP that is  cooled, resulting in the precipitation of material at the  bottom of the plasma. This product contains about half  the factor VIII activity of FFP in a tenth of the volume.  Both agents are therefore reasonable treatment options.  DDAVP (desmopressin) causes the release of a number  of factors and von Willebrand factor from the liver and  endothelial cells. This may be useful for patients with  mild hemophilia. Recombinant or purified factor VIII  (i.e., Humate P) is indicated in patients with more severe  bleeding. Therapy may be required for weeks, with lev- els of factor VIII kept at 50%, for postsurgical or severe  bleeding. Plasmapheresis has no role in the treatment of  patients with hemophilia A.","E.

53,All of the following statements regarding the lupus  anticoagulant (LA) are true EXCEPT: A. LAs typically prolong the activated partial thrombo- plastin time. B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence  of LAs. C. Bleeding episodes in patients with LAs may be   severe and life threatening. D. Female patients may experience recurrent   midtrimester abortions. E. LAs may occur in the absence of other signs of   systemic lupus erythematosus.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 20) Lupus anticoagulants (Las) cause prolonga- tion of coagulation tests by binding to phospholipids.  Although most often encountered in patients with sys- temic lupus erythematosus, they may also develop in  normal individuals. The diagnosis is first suggested by  prolongation of coagulation tests. Failure to correct  with incubation with normal plasma confirms the pres- ence of a circulating inhibitor. Contrary to the name,  patients with LA activity have normal hemostasis and are  not predisposed to bleeding. Instead, they are at risk for  venous and arterial thromboembolisms. Patients with a  history of recurrent unplanned abortions or thrombosis  should undergo lifelong anticoagulation. The presence  of LAs or anticardiolipin antibodies without a history  of thrombosis may be observed because many of these  patients will not go on to develop a thrombotic event.",B.

Factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Factor VII inhibitor E. Factor IX inhibitor,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) involves the factors of the intrinsic pathway of  coagulation. Prolongation of the aPTT reflects either a  deficiency of one of these factors (factor VIII, IX, XI,  XII, and so on) or inhibition of the activity of one of the  factors or components of the aPTT assay (i.e., phospho- lipids). This may be further characterized by the â€œmix- ing studyâ€ in which the patientâ€™s plasma is mixed with  pooled plasma. Correction of the aPTT reflects a defi- ciency of factors that are replaced by the pooled sample.  Failure to correct the aPTT reflects the presence of a fac- tor inhibitor or phospholipid inhibitor. Common causes  of a failure to correct include the presence of heparin in  the sample, factor inhibitors (factor VIII inhibitor being  the most common), and the presence of antiphospho- lipid antibodies. Factor VII is involved in the extrinsic  pathway of coagulation. Inhibitors to factor VII would  result in prolongation of the prothrombin time.",D. Factor VII inhibitor,D. Factor VII inhibitor

Which of the following is most likely  to yield a diagnosis for the cause of his GI bleeding? A. Factor VIII activity level B. Helicobacter pylori antibody test C. Hepatitis B surface antigen D. Hepatitis C RNA E. Mesenteric angiogram","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) This patient presents with a significant upper  gastrointestinal (GI) bleed with a prolonged prothrom- bin time (PT). Hemophilia should not cause a prolonged  PT. This and the presence of ascites raise the possibility  of liver disease and cirrhosis. The contamination of blood  products in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in widespread  transmission of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) within  the hemophilia population receiving factor infusions.    Review and Self-Assessment 769 It is estimated in 2006, that >80% of hemophilia patients  older than 20 years old are infected with HCV. Viral  inactivation steps were introduced in the 1980s, and  recombinant factor VIII and IX were first produced in  the 1990s. HCV is the major cause of morbidity and  the second leading cause of death in patients exposed  to older factor concentrates. Patients develop cirrhosis  and complications that include ascites and variceal bleed- ing. End-stage liver disease requiring a liver transplant is  curative for the cirrhosis and the hemophilia (the liver  produces factor VIII). Hepatitis B was not transmitted in  significant numbers to patients with hemophilia. Diver- ticular disease or peptic ulcer disease would not explain  the prolonged PT. Patients with inadequately repleted  factor VIII levels are more likely to develop hemarthro- ses than GI bleeds, and the slightly prolonged activated  partial thromboplastin time makes this unlikely.","E. Mesenteric angiogram

Given the patient's history of hemophilia A and acute upper GI bleed, a mesenteric angiogram would be the most likely test to yield a diagnosis for the cause of his bleeding. This test can help identify the source of bleeding in the GI tract, such as a vascular abnormality or arteriovenous malformation, which may be more common in patients with hemophilia. The other options listed are less likely to be the cause of his current presentation.",A. Factor VIII activity level

Serial laboratory analysis  Review and Self-Assessment 737","The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) The differentiation between disseminated  intravascular coagulation (DIC) and severe liver disease  is challenging. Both entities may manifest with similar  laboratory findings, which are elevated fibrinogen deg- radation products, prolonged activated partial thrombo- plastin time and prothrombin time, anemia, and throm- bocytopenia. When suspecting DIC, these tests should  be repeated over a period of 6 to 8 hours because abnor- malities may change dramatically in patients with severe  DIC. In contrast, these test results should not fluctuate  as much in patients with severe liver disease. Bacterial  sepsis with positive blood cultures is a common cause of  DIC but is not diagnostic.","E. Serial laboratory analysis

The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease in this patient is to perform serial laboratory analysis. DIC is a dynamic process that can progress rapidly, so monitoring the patient's laboratory values over time can help differentiate between acute DIC and chronic liver disease. In DIC, there will be a progressive decrease in platelet count, increase in international normalized ratio (INR), and elevated d-dimer levels. Chronic liver disease may also present with abnormal coagulation parameters, but the pattern of changes over time can help differentiate between the two conditions.",The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease in this scenario is by evaluating the serial laboratory analysis.

Age older than 70 years B. History of active tobacco use C. Lack of suggestive clinical symptoms D. Negative Homanâ€™s sign on examination E. Previous DVT in the past year","The answer is A.  (Chap. 21) d-Dimer is a degradation product of cross- linked fibrin and is elevated in conditions of ongoing  thrombosis. Low concentrations of d-dimer are considered  to indicate the absence of thrombosis. Patients older than  the age of 70 years frequently have elevated d-dimers  in the absence of thrombosis, making this test less pre- dictive of acute disease. Clinical symptoms are often not  present in patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)  and do not affect interpretation of a d-dimer. Tobacco  use, although frequently considered a risk factor for  DVT, and previous DVT should not affect the predic- tive value of d-dimer. Homanâ€™s sign, calf pain elicited by  dorsiflexion of the foot, is not predictive of DVT and is  unrelated to d-dimer.","D. Negative Homan's sign on examination

Homan's sign is not a reliable indicator of DVT and its absence does not necessarily rule out the presence of a DVT. The other factors listed, such as age older than 70 years, history of active tobacco use, lack of suggestive clinical symptoms, and previous DVT in the past year, are all risk factors that can make d-dimer less predictive of DVT in this patient.",The lack of suggestive clinical symptoms makes d-dimer less predictive of DVT in this patient.

Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast  multislice computed tomography scan of the chest. E. Obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography  scan of the chest.","The answer is E.  (Chaps. 21 and 22) The clinical probability of pulmonary  embolism (pulmonary embolism) can be delineated into  low to high likelihood using the clinical decision rule  shown in Table 22-1. In those with a score of 3 or less,  pulmonary embolism is low or moderately likely, and a  d-dimer test should be performed. A normal d-dimer  result combined with a low to moderate clinical prob- ability of pulmonary embolism identifies patients who  do not need further testing or anticoagulation therapy.  Those with either a likely clinical probability (score >3)  or an abnormal d-dimer (with unlikely clinical probabil- ity) require an imaging test to rule out pulmonary embo- lism. Currently, the most attractive imaging method to  detect pulmonary embolism is the multislice computed  tomography (CT). It is accurate and, if the result is nor- mal, safely rules out pulmonary embolism. This patient  has a clinical probability score of 4.5 because of her rest- ing tachycardia and the lack of an alternative diagnosis at  least as likely as pulmonary embolism. Therefore, there is  no indication for measuring d-dimer, and she should pro- ceed directly to multislice CT of the chest. If this cannot  be performed expeditiously, she should receive one dose  of low-molecular-weight heparin while awaiting the test.","D. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest.

Given the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and increased frequency of smoking, along with her age and use of oral contraceptives, there is a concern for pulmonary embolism. The first step in evaluating for pulmonary embolism is to check a d-dimer level. If the d-dimer is abnormal, further imaging with a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest is indicated to confirm the diagnosis.","D.

60,All of the anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs listed  are correctly matched with their mechanisms of  action EXCEPT: A. Abciximabâ€”Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor   inhibitor B. Clopidogrelâ€”Adenosine diphosphate receptor  blockade C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition D. Rivaroxabanâ€”Factor Xa inhibition E. Warfarinâ€”Inhibition of production of the vitamin  Kâ€“dependent clotting factors,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 23) In recent years, a variety of new anticoagulant  and antiplatelet drugs have been developed for clinical use.   Platelets play an important role in arterial thrombosis,  particularly in coronary artery and cerebrovascular dis- ease. Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet drug  worldwide. Aspirin exerts its effects through inhibition of  cyclooxygenase-1. Other commonly used oral antiplatelet  agents are clopidogrel and dipyridamole. Clopidogrel is in  a class of agents called thienopyridines along with ticlopi- dine. Thienopyridines act to block a specific adenosine  diphosphate receptor (P2Y12) and inhibit platelet aggrega- tion. Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase to decrease  the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP) to decrease platelet aggregation. Intravenous  antiplatelet agents have also become increasingly impor- tant in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. All of  the intravenous agents act to inhibit platelet aggregation  by blocking the glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa receptor. The   Review and Self-Assessment 770 three agents in clinical use as Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors are  abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban.  Anticoagulant agents are primarily used for the preven- tion and treatment of venous thrombosis. Many antico- agulants are available and act by a variety of mechanisms.  Heparin has been used for many years but requires frequent  monitoring to be used safely. More recently, low-molec- ular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been introduced.  These agents are given subcutaneously and generally pre- ferred in many instances over heparin given a more predict- able anticoagulant effect. Both heparin and the LMWHs  are indirect thrombin inhibitors that act primarily through  activation of antithrombin. When activated, antithrombin  inhibits clotting enzymes, especially thrombin and factor  Xa. Fondaparinux is a newer anticoagulant that inhibits  only factor Xa, although it is a synthetic analogue of the  pentasaccharide sequence in heparin that binds antithrom- bin. However, it is too short to bridge antithrombin to  thrombin. The direct thrombin inhibitors bind directly to  thrombin (rather than antithrombin) to exert their activ- ity. The direct thrombin inhibitors include lepirudin, arg- atroban, and bivalirudin. The most commonly used oral  anticoagulant is warfarin, which inhibits the production  of vitamin Kâ€“dependent clotting factors. Given the need  for frequent monitoring and extensive drug interactions,  developing other oral anticoagulants that are safe and effec- tive has been desired for many years. No oral drug has yet  been introduced into the market. However, several are in  the final stages of development. These include two factor  Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and one factor IIa  inhibitor (dabigatran etexilate).","C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition

Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that acts by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, leading to inhibition of factor Xa. It does not directly inhibit thrombin.",C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition
61,"A 66-year-old woman is prescribed clopidogrel  and aspirin after implantation of a bare metal stent  in her right coronary artery. Two weeks after the  procedure, the woman presents to the emergency  department with acute-onset chest pain and elec- trocardiographic changes consistent with an acute  inferior myocardial infarction. Emergent cardiac  catheterization confirms in-stent restenosis. The  patient insists she has been adherent to her pre- scribed therapy. Which of the following state- ments most correctly described the most likely  cause of the patientâ€™s restenosis despite her current  therapy? A. She likely has aspirin resistance and should be treated  with higher doses of aspirin to prevent a recurrence. B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a  genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway. C. She should have been treated with low-molecular- weight heparin to prevent this complication. D. She should have been treated with warfarin to pre- vent this complication. E. Because she has demonstrated resistance to clopido- grel, switching to prasugrel would not be useful to  prevent further complications.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) After implantation of a bare metal coronary  artery stent, aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended  for at least 4 weeks to decrease the risk of in-stent reste- nosis. This patient, however, developed the complica- tion despite adherence to her therapy. This generally  suggests resistance to clopidogrel with a decreased ability  of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregation. There is  a known genetic component to clopidogrel resistance  related to specific genetic polymorphisms of the CYP  isoenzymes. Up to 25% of whites, 30% of African Amer- icans, and 50% of Asians may carry an allele that renders  them resistant to clopidogrel. These polymorphisms are  less important in the activation of prasugrel. Thus, in  individuals who have evidence of clopidogrel resistance,  switching to prasugrel should be considered.  Aspirin resistance is a more controversial subject. It  is defined simply in clinical terms as failure of aspirin to  prevent ischemic vascular events. Biochemically, aspirin  resistance can be defined by failure of usual doses of the  drug to produce inhibitory effects on platelet function.  However, resistance to aspirin is not reversed by higher  doses of aspirin or adding another antiplatelet agent.  Because the primary mechanism of arterial thrombosis  is platelet aggregation, the anticoagulant agents warfarin  and low-molecular-weight heparin are not indicated.","B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires activation by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway in order to become effective. Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP pathway can lead to variability in the activation of clopidogrel, resulting in clopidogrel resistance. This can lead to inadequate platelet inhibition and an increased risk of stent thrombosis and restenosis. Switching to a different antiplatelet agent, such as prasugrel, may be more effective in patients with clopidogrel resistance.","E. Because she has demonstrated resistance to clopidogrel, switching to prasugrel would not be useful to prevent further complications."
62,"A 48-year-old woman is diagnosed with a deep- vein thrombosis of her left lower extremity. When  considering initial anticoagulant therapy, all of the  following are advantages of low-molecular-weight  heparins over heparin EXCEPT: A. Better bioavailability B. Dose-dependent clearance C. Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection D. Lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia E. Predictable anticoagulant effect","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs)  have largely replaced heparin for most indications if a  patient does not have any contraindications to therapy.  LMWHs have better bioavailability and longer half-lives  after subcutaneous injection. Thus, they can be given at  routine intervals for both prophylaxis and treatment. In  addition, dosing of LMWHs is simplified because these  drugs have a dose-independent clearance, and predict- able anticoagulant effects means that monitoring of anti- coagulant effect is not required in most patients. Finally,  LMWHs have a lower risk of heparin-induced throm- bocytopenia, which is important in both short- and  long-term administration.","B. Dose-dependent clearance

Low-molecular-weight heparins have dose-independent clearance, meaning that the clearance does not vary based on the dose administered. This is an advantage over heparin, which has dose-dependent clearance.",D. Lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

A 48-year-old man with no medical history who  presents with calf pain following prolonged air travel;  the alveolarâ€“arterial oxygen gradient is normal C. A 56-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for  breast cancer D. A 62-year-old man who underwent hip replacement  surgery 4 weeks previously E. A 72-year-old man who had an acute myocardial  infarction 2 weeks ago,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) The d-dimer measured by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is elevated in the setting  of breakdown of fibrin by plasmin, and the presence of  a positive d-dimer can prompt the need for additional  imaging for deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary  embolus in specific clinical situations in which the patient  would be considered to have an elevation in d-dimer.  However, one must be cautious about placing value on  an elevated d-dimer in other situations when there can  be an alternative explanation for the elevated level. Of  the scenarios listed in the question, the only patient who  would be expected to have a negative d-dimer result  would be the patient with calf pain and recent air travel.  The presence of a normal alveolarâ€“arterial oxygen gradi- ent cannot reliably differentiate between those with and  without pulmonary embolism. In all the other scenarios,  elevations in d-dimer could be related to other medi- cal conditions and provide no diagnostic information  to inform the clinician regarding the need for further  evaluation. Some common clinical situations in which  the d-dimer is elevated include sepsis, myocardial infarc- tion, cancer, pneumonia, the postoperative state, and the  second and third trimesters of pregnancy.","C. A 56-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer

Patients with cancer, especially those undergoing chemotherapy, are at higher risk for developing pulmonary embolism. Therefore, a positive d-dimer in this patient would prompt additional testing for a pulmonary embolus.",A. A 24-year-old woman who is 32 weeks pregnant
64,A 62-year-old woman is hospitalized following  an acute pulmonary embolism. All of the follow- ing would typically indicate a massive pulmonary  embolism EXCEPT: A. Elevated serum troponin levels B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis C. Initial presentation with syncope D. Presence of right ventricular enlargement on CT  scan of the chest E. Presence of right ventricular hypokinesis on   echocardiogram,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) Clinically, individuals with massive pulmonary  embolus present with hypotension, syncope, or cyanosis.  The hypotension and syncope occur due to acute right ven- tricular overload, and elevated troponin or amino terminal   (NT)-pro-brain natriuretic peptide can result from this  right ventricular strain. Both elevated troponin and NT- pro-brain natriuretic peptide predict worse outcomes in  pulmonary embolism. Further prognostic signs of massive  pulmonary embolism include the presence of right ventric- ular enlargement on computed tomography of the chest  or right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiography.   The presence of hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, or   Review and Self-Assessment 771 cough in association with pulmonary embolism most  commonly indicates a small peripheral lesion.","A. Elevated serum troponin levels

Elevated serum troponin levels are typically seen in cases of myocardial infarction or heart failure, not necessarily in cases of pulmonary embolism. The other options are more commonly associated with a massive pulmonary embolism.",A. Elevated serum troponin levels
65,"Which of the following statements regarding diag- nostic imaging in pulmonary embolism is TRUE? A. A high probability ventilationâ€“perfusion scan is one  that has at least one segmental perfusion defect in the  setting of normal ventilation. B. If a patient has a high probability ventilationâ€“  perfusion scan, there is a 90% likelihood that the  patient does indeed have a pulmonary embolism. C. Magnetic resonance angiography provides excel- lent resolution for both large proximal and smaller  segmental pulmonary emboli. D. Multidetector-row spiral CT imaging is suboptimal  for detecting small peripheral emboli, necessitating  the use of invasive pulmonary angiography. E. None of the routinely used imaging techniques  provide adequate evaluation of the right ventricle to  assist in risk stratification of the patient.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) For many years, ventilationâ€“perfusion imag- ing (V-Q) was the standard for the diagnosis of pulmo- nary embolism (pulmonary embolism). Determination of  abnormal V-Q imaging can be difficult. To call a V-Q  scan a high-probability scan, one needs to see two or more  segmental perfusion defects in the setting of normal venti- lation. In patients with underlying lung disease, however,  ventilation is frequently abnormal, and most patients with  pulmonary embolism do not actually have high-probabil- ity V-Q scans. When there is a high-probability V-Q scan,  the likelihood of pulmonary embolism is 90% or greater.  Alternatively, patients with normal perfusion imaging  have a very low likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Most  patients fall into either the low or intermediate probabil- ity of having a pulmonary embolism by V-Q imaging.  In this setting, 40% of patients with a high clinical suspi- cion of pulmonary embolism are determined by pulmo- nary angiography to indeed have a pulmonary embolism  despite having a low-probability V-Q scan. At the present  time, V-Q scanning is largely supplanted by multidetec- tor-row spiral computed tomography (CT) angiography  of the chest. Compared with conventional CT scanning  with intravenous contrast, the multidetector spiral CT can  provide evaluation of the pulmonary arteries to the sixth- order branches, a level of resolution that is as good as or  exceeds that of conventional invasive pulmonary angiog- raphy. In addition, the CT allows evaluation of the right  and left ventricles as well as the lung parenchyma to pro- vide additional information regarding prognosis in acute  pulmonary embolism or alternative diagnosis in the patient  with dyspnea. Magnetic resonance angiography is a rarely  used alternative to the above modalities in patients with  contrast dye allergy. This technique provides the ability to  detect large proximal PEs but lacks reliability for segmental  and subsegmental pulmonary embolism.",E. None of the routinely used imaging techniques provide adequate evaluation of the right ventricle to assist in risk stratification of the patient.,"D. Multidetector-row spiral CT imaging is suboptimal for detecting small peripheral emboli, necessitating the use of invasive pulmonary angiography."
66,"A 53-year-old woman presents to the hospital fol- lowing an episode of syncope, with ongoing light- headedness and shortness of breath. She had a history  of antiphospholipid syndrome with prior pulmo- nary embolism and has been nonadherent to her  anticoagulation medication recently. She has been  prescribed warfarin, 7.5 mg daily, but reports taking  it only intermittently. She does not know her most  recent INR. On presentation to the emergency  department, she appears diaphoretic and tachy- pneic. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pres- sure of 86/44 mm Hg, heart rate of 130 beats/min,     respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, and oxygen satu- ration of 85% on room air. Cardiovascular examina- tion shows a regular tachycardia without murmurs,  rubs, or gallops. The lungs are clear to auscultation.  On extremity examination, there is swelling of her  left thigh with a positive Homanâ€™s sign. Chest CT  angiography confirms a saddle pulmonary embolus  with ongoing clot seen in the pelvic veins on the  left. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is  administered. After a fluid bolus of 1 L, the patientâ€™s  blood pressure remains low at 88/50 mm Hg.  Echocardiogram demonstrates hypokinesis of the  right ventricle. On 100% non-rebreather mask, the  oxygen saturation is 92%. What is the next best step  in the management of this patient? A. Continue current management. B. Continue IV fluids at 500 mL/h for a total of 4 L of  fluid resuscitation. C. Refer for inferior vena cava filter placement and  continue current management. D. Refer for surgical embolectomy. E. Treat with dopamine and recombinant tissue plas- minogen activator, 100 mg IV.","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) This patient is presenting with massive pul- monary embolus (pulmonary embolism) with ongoing  hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and profound  hypoxemia requiring 100% oxygen. In this setting, con- tinuing with anticoagulation alone is inadequate, and  the patient should receive circulatory support with fibri- nolysis if there are no contraindications to therapy. The  major contraindications to fibrinolysis include hyperten- sion >180/110 mm Hg, known intracranial disease or  prior hemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery, or trauma. The  recommended fibrinolytic regimen is recombinant tissue   plasminogen activator (rTPA), 100 mg IV over 2 hours.  Heparin should be continued with the fibrinolytic to pre- vent a rebound hypercoagulable state with dissolution of the  clot. There is a 10% risk of major bleeding with fibrinolytic  therapy, with a 1â€“3% risk of intracranial hemorrhage.   The only indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolism  is for massive pulmonary embolism presenting with life- threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and  refractory hypoxemia. In submassive pulmonary embolism  presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of  right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the deci- sion to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case basis.  In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive  circulatory support with vasopressors. Dopamine and  dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treat- ment of shock in pulmonary embolism. Caution should be  taken with ongoing high-volume fluid administration, as  a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly toler- ant of additional fluids. Ongoing fluids may worsen right  ventricular ischemia and further dilate the right ventricle,  displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen  cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contra- indications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized  with vasopressor support, referral for surgical embolec- tomy should be considered. Referral for inferior vena cava  filter placement is not indicated at this time. The patient  should be stabilized hemodynamically as a first priority.  The indications for inferior vena cava filter placement are  active bleeding, precluding anticoagulation, and recurrent  deep-vein thrombosis on adequate anticoagulation.","E. Treat with dopamine and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 100 mg IV.

This patient is presenting with a massive pulmonary embolism causing hemodynamic instability and right ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with thrombolytic therapy, such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, is indicated in this situation to help dissolve the clot and improve hemodynamics. Dopamine can also be used to help support blood pressure in this setting. Continuing current management or IV fluids alone may not be sufficient in this critical situation. Referral for inferior vena cava filter placement or surgical embolectomy may be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated or unsuccessful.",The next best step in the management of this patient would be to refer for surgical embolectomy.
67,"A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency  department with acute onset of shortness of breath.  She recently had been to visit her parents out of state  and rode in a car for about 9 hours each way. Two  days ago, she developed mild calf pain and swelling,  but she thought that this was not unusual after having  been sitting with her legs dependent for the recent  trip. On arrival to the emergency department, she is  noted to be tachypneic. The vital signs are as follows:     blood pressure of 98/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 114  beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, oxygen  saturation of 92% on room air, and weight of 89 kg.  The lungs are clear bilaterally. There is pain in the  right calf with dorsiflexion of the foot, and the right  leg is more swollen compared with the left. An arterial  blood gas measurement shows a pH of 7.52, PCO2 25  mm Hg, and PO2 68 mm Hg. Kidney and liver func- tion are normal. A helical CT scan confirms a pulmo- nary embolus. All of the following agents can be used  alone as initial therapy in this patient EXCEPT: A. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC twice daily B. Fondaparinux 7.5 mg SC once daily C. Tinzaparin 175 U/kg SC once daily D. Unfractionated heparin IV adjusted to maintain  activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two to  three times the upper limit of normal E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2â€“3  Review and Self-Assessment 739","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) Warfarin should not be used alone as ini- tial therapy for the treatment of venous thromboem- bolic disease (VTE) for two reasons. First, warfarin does  not achieve full anticoagulation for at least 5 days, as its  mechanism of action is to decrease the production of  vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagulation factors in the liver.  Second, a paradoxical reaction that promotes coagu- lation may also occur upon initiation of warfarin as it  also decreases the production of the vitamin Kâ€“depen- dent anticoagulants protein C and protein S, which  have shorter half-lives than the procoagulant factors.  For many years, unfractionated heparin delivered intra- venously was the treatment of choice for VTE. How- ever, it requires frequent monitoring of activated partial  thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels and hospitalization  until therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR)  is achieved with warfarin. There are now several safe  and effective alternatives to unfractionated heparin that  can be delivered SC. Low-molecular-weight heparins  (enoxaparin, tinzaparin) are fragments of unfraction- ated heparin with a lower molecular weight. These  compounds have a greater bioavailability, longer half- life, and more predictable onset of action. Their use in  renal insufficiency should be considered with  caution  because low-molecular-weight heparins are renally  cleared. Fondaparinux is a direct factor Xa inhibitor   that, like low-molecular-weight heparins, requires no   Review and Self-Assessment 772 monitoring of anticoagulant effects and has been demon- strated to be safe and effective in treating both deep-vein  thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.","E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2-3

Warfarin is not typically used as initial therapy for a pulmonary embolism because it takes several days to reach therapeutic levels. Initial therapy usually involves a parenteral anticoagulant such as enoxaparin, fondaparinux, or tinzaparin, followed by transition to an oral anticoagulant like warfarin.",D. Unfractionated heparin IV adjusted to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two to three times the upper limit of normal
