"Pathogenesis, and Treatment  of the Acute Porphyrias   A late teen-aged female developed several episodes  of acute abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diar- rhea, altered mental status, and grand-mal seizures.  She was hospitalized at each episode. On physical  exam, she was hypertensive and tachycardic. Her  abdomen was tender to  palpation, especially in the  right upper quadrant, but without hepatomegaly.  Her back was also painful, limiting her ability to sit  up, and her deep tendon reÔ¨Ç exes were absent. Her  initial laboratory data included an elevated white  blood cell count and a serum sodium of 125 mEq/L  (normal ‚â•135).

"and Treatment of a Non-acute  Cutaneous Porphyria   A 35-year-old man was seen for upper extremity  and facial blisters, associated with increased skin  sensitivity, blister breakage, and hypertrichosis.  He denied having major abdominal problems.  After studies for possible causes, he was referred  to a porphyria specialist. Further studies were  normal except for a 24-h urine, which showed a  markedly increased amount of uroporphyrin  (1841 Œºg/24 h; normal ‚â§75 Œºg), thus determining  the diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).  The patient had no family history of similar cuta- neous phenomena, and no environmental cause  of PCT was obvious. Testing for hepatitis was  negative, serum ferritin was elevated, serum iron/ iron binding capacity was normal, and the hemo- chromatosis gene was heterozygous for the H63D  mutation. He was treated with biweekly phlebot- omy, leading to reduction of the urine uroporphy- rin to normal and serum ferritin to low after  6 months of treatment. He is monitored by urine  uroporphyrin analysis every 9‚Äì12 months, and  his uroporphyrin excretion has remained normal  for several years.   Question 4.

by a screening hemoglobin at age 1 year and was 
treated with ferrous sulfate (4 mg/kg/day of ele
mental iron) for 6 weeks without signifi cant effect. 
A second course was then instituted again without 
effect. His hematologic values are noted below. 
Signifi cant family history includes a brother with a 
similar iron-unresponsive microcytic anemia and a 
maternal uncle with iron overload syndrome.

The genetic defect in severe combined immu- nodeÔ¨Å ciency resides in the haematopoietic  stem cell, and so there is never a requirement  for thymic transplantation.     B.  For rare cases of severe combined immuno- deÔ¨Å ciency, T lymphocyte development is  interrupted because of an absence of thymic  tissue, and thymic transplantation can cure  these patients.     C.  The thymus is important in inducing toler- ance, and athymic severe combined immuno- deÔ¨Å ciency patients reject a thymic allograft.   D.  Thymic transplantation needs to be per- formed along side with allo-HCT in order to  secure donor haematopoietic cell engraftment  and long-term thymopoiesis. ",B

"of Neutropenia in Childhood   Question 1.   An 18-month-old male with a his- tory of recurrent skin abscesses is referred to a  pediatric hematologist upon discovery of an  absolute neutrophil count <100/ŒºL measured on  two occasions, 10 days apart. Past medical his- tory is also signiÔ¨Å cant for neonatal omphalitis  and recurrent otitis media. Examination reveals  weight at the 3rd percentile for age, but otherwise   no physical abnormalities. Other than neutrope
nia, the patientís complete blood count is within 
normal limits. BM biopsy and aspirate reveal 
normal overall cellularity, but myeloid matura
tion arrest at the promyelocyte stage. 
What further diagnostic testing is 
indicated? 
    A.  
  No further testing is needed, as the diagnosis 
and approach to long-term treatment are clear 
based on clinical diagnostic criteria.

" Question 2.   Subsequent genetic testing demon- strated a mutation in exon 3 of  ELANE  (c.242G>C) resulting in a single amino acid sub- stitution (p.Arg81Pro). G-CSF therapy was initi- ated, and the patient subsequently was able to  maintain an ANC of 1200‚Äì1800/ŒºL on a G-CSF  dose of 5 Œºg/kg/day over the next 8 years. He  exhibited no subsequent bacterial infections,  except for a skin abscess that developed while  neutropenic (ANC <200/ŒºL) because of brief  G-CSF noncompliance. Surveillance bone mar- row (BM) aspirates/biopsies have revealed no  morphologic or cytogenetic evidence of myelo- dysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The parents of your 11-year-old  patient ask whether their son could be a candidate  for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  (HSCT), which they recently discussed in an  online parent support group. The patient has two  full siblings with normal neutrophil counts.   What recommendation do you make  regarding future therapy, including HSCT?   A.  Attempt to wean off of G-CSF, and only con- sider HSCT if remission is not achieved.    B.   Continue current G-CSF therapy and serial BM  surveillance, and refer to stem cell transplant  (HSCT) team only if MDS or AML develops.     C.

The attending hematologist at a ter- tiary referral center is asked to consult on a  33-year-old male because of macrocytic anemia  and worsening pancytopenia. The patient is  5 months post orthotopic liver transplant because  of cryptogenic liver cirrhosis.   In this scenario, is a workup for IBMF syn- dromes indicated?   A.  Yes, because of worsening pancytopenia    B.  Yes, because persistent macrocytic anemia  after liver transplant is unusual    C.   Yes, because of the association with crypto- genic liver cirrhosis at the age of 33   D.  Yes, all of the above ",D 
" Question 6.   Physical examination shows a  180 cm, 72 kg male of Northern European  decent, with gray hair, normal oral mucosa, nor- mal dentition, hyperpigmented areas on his  lower extremities, normal nails and digits, and a  laparotomy scar. Family history is negative for  hematologic disease including leukemia, but  positive for early graying and an uncle who died  at a young age of alcoholic liver disease. Review  of past medical history reveals that pancytopenia  and macrocytosis preceded liver transplant.  Laboratory evaluations are negative for an acute  viral infection or reactivation. Bone marrow  (BM) aspirate and biopsy show a hypocellular  marrow (10 % of normal) with trilineage hema- topoiesis, greatly reduced megakaryocytes, and  no dysplasia. Molecular analysis of BM and  blood was negative for donor chimerism.   With this additional information is there a  likely diagnosis? What laboratory tests are  indicated for a molecular diagnosis?   A.  Yes, dyskeratosis congenita (DC). Send telo- mere length measurements and genetic test- ing for genes responsible for dyskeratosis  congenita.      B.  No, a deÔ¨Å nitive diagnosis is difÔ¨Å cult. Send  next-generation  sequencing  panel  that  includes genes mutated in the ten most com- mon forms of inherited bone marrow failure.    C.  No, the clinical presentation is not classic for  any common IBMF syndrome. Send whole  exome sequencing as the next diagnostic step,  as it will test for both known and new bone  marrow failure genes.  ",A 
" Question 7.   Figure  2 shows the results of telo- mere measurements in peripheral blood using  Ô¨Ç ow cytometry. Genetic testing revealed a variant  of unknown signiÔ¨Å cance in exon 14 of the TERT  gene (G3115A), resulting in a single amino acid  substitution (alanine for threonine at codon  1039). The clinical testing report further explains  that this variant was not reported previously and  was not found in population-based cohorts.  Furthermore the amino acid is poorly conserved  in available species and in silico protein function  analysis predicts the mutation to be benign and  tolerated.  Does the patient have DC? What additional  testing could solidify the diagnosis?   A.  Yes, the patient has DC and the variant of  unknown signiÔ¨Å cance is causing disease as  no other mutation or variant was identiÔ¨Å ed in  six tested genes. No further testing is required.    B.  No, the patient does not have DC because the  variant of unknown signiÔ¨Å cance is predicted  to be benign and no other mutation or variant  was identiÔ¨Å ed. A next-generation sequencing  panel including additional known BMF genes  should be performed.     C.  Yes, the patient has DC but the variant of  unknown signiÔ¨Å cance is not causing disease  as it is predicted to be benign. Because  genetic testing is only available for six out of  ten DC genes, whole exome sequencing  should be used to look for mutations in the  remaining known DC genes or in novel DC  genes.   D.  Yes, the patient most likely has DC because  of his classic clinical manifestations and the  very short telomeres. It is highly likely that  the variant of unknown signiÔ¨Å cance is patho- genic and responsible for his disease.  ",D 
" Question 8.   Once a diagnosis of DC is con- Ô¨Å rmed, what treatment is suggested?   A.  The only cure for DC is hematopoietic stem  cell transplant.     B.  There is no cure for DC.
