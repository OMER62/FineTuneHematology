0,"A S8-year-old man is evaluated for possible smoldering myeloma. Medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. On physical examination, vital signs and other exam- ination flndings are normal. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoflxation show an IgA protein spike of 3.5 g/dl (35 g/L). Bone mar- row biopsy reveals 50% clonal plasma cells. Whole-body low-dose CT scan is negative for bone lesions. Which of the following is the most appropriate imaging test to perform next? (A) Bone scan (B) Skeletal survey (C) Whole-bodyMRI (D) No further testing","Answer:  C Educational Objective: Evaluate smoldering myeloma with whole-body MRL Whole body MRI is the most appropriate imaging test to perfirrm next in this patient (Option C). Smolderir.rg rrultiple myekrml (MM) is characterized by a serum M pnrtein level ot'3 grdL (:10 gi L) or greater (or >500 n'rg,/24 hr <tf urinary r.nonoclonal lree light chains) or bone nlarrow plasnra clonal cells of lO'X, to 59',1, and no evidence of r.uyekrma related signs or syntptoms. All patients with MM should be assessed tbr skeletal lesions at diagnosis, periodically there:rfler. and when new symptoms occur. Skeletal survey fbllowing a negative low dose CT scan would not provicle any value. Low close CT and PE'l CT scan are recomntencled as the ini tial inraging procedure because of increasecl sensitivity. CT is lrref'erred because of its relatively high sensitivity, speed, ancl patient convenience. If initial imaging with rvhole body krw dose CT is negative, whole body MRI is recontntencled. MRI has been fbund to be more sensitive in iclentilying myeloma related bone lesions and soft tissue lesions fron-r plasnracytoma but is more inconvenient fbr the patient. tf' nrore than one lesion greater than 5 mm is discovered, the patient should be considered to have MM requirir.rg therapy. In this patient with smoldering MM. negative finclings r-rn w,hole body low dose CT scan does not exclude skeletal lesions, and MRI is needed for further evaluation. Although bone scans are useful in detecting bone nletilstases fiom underlying cancer, the bone lesions in MM are otten purely lytic and lack the enhanced osteoblast activ ity that is shown by bone scan imaging. Bonc scans should not be used to assess bone involvement in MM (Option A). In the evaluation of MM, advanced cross sectional imagir.rg with whole-body low dose CT, PET CT scan, or wholc body MRI is preferred to a radiographic skeletal sur vey because advanced cross sectional imaging is signifi cantly nrore sensitive and better able to classify the patient's disease and thereby guide therapy (Option B). 'lhe presence or absence of local skeletal lesions on whole body MRI wiil determine the pl:rn of carc ftrr patients with sntoldering MM.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient is intra venous immune gkrbulir.r (IVIC) (Option C). She has pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) characterized by normocytic ane mia with decreased reticukrcytes and absent or decreased erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and with giant proerythroblasts with intranuclear viral inclusions characteristic of parvovirus Bl9 infection. Several condi tions have beer.r implicatecl in the pathogenesis of PRCA, and chief among thern are parvovirus B19 infection, thy moma, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythemato sus), and lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas. Because of her recent chemotherlpy, she is immunocompromised and vulnerable to viral inlections such as parvovirus Bl9, which she may have been exposed to as a kindergarten teacher. Parvovirus infection in adults may be asymptom :rtic or associated with tever, coryza, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. fbtlowed by a rash. ln adults, the classic ""slapped cheek"" rash may not be apparent but other cuta neous manifestations mily occur.

2,"A S5-year-old woman is evaluated before starting che- motherapy for multiple myeloma. Anticipated therapy will include bortezomib, Ienalidomide, dexamethasone, and daily low-dose aspirin. She has otherwise been well, has no symptoms, and has no previous history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or risk factors for VTE. She takes no medications. Today, her hemoglobin level is 9 g/dl (eo s/L). Inactivated influenza and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines will be administered today. The patient received the herpes zoster virus recombinant vaccine at age 50 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional treatment during chemotherapy? (A) Epoetin (B) Fluconazole (C) Metronidazole (D) Valacyclovir","Answer: E Educational Objective: Evaluate a pregnant patient for pulmonary embolism. No further evaluation is needed (Option E). According to the pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm, this patient has a very low probability of having a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has an elevated D dimer measurement, but D dimer levels progressively increase during the course ofpregnancy, making interpretation difficult. To assist in the diagnosis of PE in pregnant women, diagnostic algorithms have been developed. The YEARS criteria have been shown to reduce the risk ofunnecessary CT angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having a PE. The YEARS algorithm assigns I point each for the presence ofthree cardinal criteria: clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis, hemoptysis, and PE as the most likely diagnosis (point range 0-3). The score is used in conjunction with four potential D-dimer results (<0.5 pg/ml lo.s mg/LJ, >0.s pg/ml [o.s mg/L], <1 pg/ml h mg/LJ, and >1 pg/ml [t mg/LJ). This patient met no YEARS clinical criteria and had a D-dimer measurement less than 1 pg/ml (f mg/L). This corresponds to very low risk for PE, so she should not undergo additional testing or anticoagulation. CT pulmonary angiography can be used in pregnancy to diagnose PE, but it exposes the woman to unnecessary radiation ifthe probability ofPE is low such as in this patient (Option A). A perfusion only scan can be used to rule out PE in a pregnant patient, but only after chest radiography has been performed and the results are interpreted as normal (Option B). This patient has a normal respiratory examination and a low probabiligz of PE, so a perlusion only scan is not needed. Similarly, a ventilation perlusion lung scan is unnecessary when the probability of PE is Iow (Option D). MRI with gadolinium can be used to detect pulmonary emboli, but it is an expensive test and not necessary for this patient with low probability for PE (Option C). Gadolin ium should not be used early in pregnancy because of the uncertainty of the effects on the fetus. MRI with gadolinium may be a diagnostic option in select patients in whom neither CT angiography nor ventilation-perfusion scan can be performed. TEY POIXTS . Pregnancy is associated with elevated D dimer meas- urement. o The pregnancy-adapted YEARS criteria along with D dimer measurement can help determine the risk for pulmonary embolism and avoid unnecessary radi ation exposure.",A
3,"A 42-year-old woman is evaluated for several months of fatigue. She reports a normal diet and no gastrointestinal symptoms. Medical history is notable for hypothyroidism and vitiligo.

(A) Acyclovir (B) Erythropoietin (C) Intravenous immune globulin (D) Prednisone","Answer: D Educational Objective: Prevent herpes zoster virus reactivation during multiple myeloma treatment. In addition to chemotherapy, this patient should receive pro phylactic therapy with valacyclovir to prevent herpes zoster virus reactivation (Option D). She is immunocompromised because of her plasma cell dyscrasia. Treatment guidelines for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) recommend that those treated with proteasome inhibitors (e.g.. bortezomib) should receive antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir, valacyclo vir) to avoid herpes zoster virus reactivation. Prophylaxis should be administered regardless ol previous immuniza tion against herpes zoster virus. This patient should not receive epoetin. an erythro poietin stimulating agent (ESA) (Option A). The American Society of Clinical Oncologz and the American Society of Hematology recommend restricting ESA use to patients with chemotherapy associated symptomatic anemia when cancer treatment is not curative in intent to reduce the need for erythrocyte transfusions. ESAs are not recom mended for patients whose cancer treatment is curative in intent. given the risk of ESA-related cancer progression. Although this recommendation is viewed by some as con troversial, this patient's anemia is asymptomatic and does not require treatment with either an ESA or erythrocyte transfusion. Antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole or levofloxacin is often administered during induction chemotherapy because of the high rate of infection with gram-negative and encapsulated bacteria during the first 3 months of therapy. Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole has been shown to decrease the number of bacterial infections and serious inf'ections. and levofloxacin prophylaxis has been associated with significantly fewer deaths and febrile episodes during this time period. The planned myeloma treatment is not associated with increased risk of fungal infection; therefore. prophylaxis with flu conazole is not indicated in this patient (Option B). Addi- tionally, metronidazole has no activity against encapsulated bacteria, a common source of infection in patients with MM, and is not indicated (Option C). 90  I Answers and Critiques t([Y PO I ]tr o Treatment guidelines for patients with multiple mye- loma recommend that those treated with proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) should receive antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir, valacyclovir) to avoid herpes zoster virus reactivation.",B

Which ofthe following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test? (A) Homocysteine level (B) Methylmalonic acid level (C) Serum folate level (D) Serum vitamin B,, level","Answer: D Educational Objective: Diagnose vitamin B,, deficiency caused by pernicious anemia. The most appropriate diagnostic test fbr this patient is mea suring the serum vitamin 8,, level (Option D). Patients with vitamin B,, deficiency can present with weight loss, glos sitis, and ""lemon yellow"" skin because of pallor and jaun dice resulting from ineffective erythropoiesis. Vitamin B,, deflciency can cause neurologic symptoms, including loss of vibratory sense, loss of proprioception, spastic ataxia, and other dorsal column symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms (megaloblastic mania) can manif'est as dementia, hallucina tions, and lrank psychosis. In patients with vitamin B,, defl ciency, the peripheral blood smear shows oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils. Pancytopenia resulting from ineflective hematopoiesis can also be seen. Other labo ratory flndings are consistent with intramedullary hemolysis caused by ineffective erythropoiesis, including decreased haptoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. The reticulocyte count is low in patients with vitamin B,, deficiency. This patient most likely has vitamin B,, deflciency caused by pernicious ane mia in which autoantibodies to intrinsic factor (lF) prevent the formation of vitamin B,r-lF complexes, resulting in the impaired ability to absorb vitamin B,r. Pernicious anemia can occur as an isolated flnding or with other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo as seen in this patient. An elevated serum homocysteine level has a sensitMty and speciflcity ofgreater than 90'1, in diagnosing folate deflciency and is the preferred test when deficiency is suspected despite a normal serum folate level (Option A). Homocysteine Ievels are also elevated in patients with vitamin 8,, deflcienry, but vitamin B,, measurement is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Serum vitamin B,, is approximately 957, sensitive in the diagnosis of vitamin B,, deficiency in symptomatic patients. Levels greater than 300 pglmL (221pmol/L) effec- tively exclude vitamin B,, deflciency; lower levels may not adequately represent tissue vitamin B,, levels. As such, an elevated concentration of methylmalonic acid is a more sen sitive indicator of vitamin B,, deficiency (Option B). How ever, serum vitamin B,, measurement remains the preferred initial diagnostic test because of its sensitivity. This patient consumes a normal diet and has no gastro intestinal symptoms. Supplemental folate has been added to grains in the United States for many years. As such, dietary folate deflciency is uncommon except in patients with mal nutrition. Folate deflciency has no association with hypothy roidism or vitiligo. Measuring the serum f,olate level would be unnecessary (Option C). KEY POIl{TS . Pernicious anemia, characterized by autoimmune gastritis and intrinsic factor deficiency, is a cause of cobalamin deficiency, which can be evaluated by measuring the serum cobalamin level. r Pemicious anemia can occur as an isolated flnding or with other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo.",C

(A) Chronic myeloid leukemia (B) Occult infection (C) Pravastatin (D) Smoking","Answer: D Educational Objective: Evaluate neutrophilia. Chronic smoking is one of the more common causes of acquired neutrophilia (Option D). How smoking causes an increase in absolute neutrophil count is not entirely clear, but it may be related to inducing an inflammatory process. The degree of neutrophilia appears to be proportional to the amount smoked, and this neutrophilia can persist for a pro longed time even after cessation (for years in some persons). Several other factors can cause an asymptomatic increase in neutrophil count, including asplenia, chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and vigorous exercise. All patients who smoke should be coun seled to stop smoking and should be offered pharmacologic assistance. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may also cause asymptomatic neutrophilia, although patients. not unconl monly, have systemic symptoms or symptoms related to hepatosplenomegaly, which are absent in this patient (Option A). Patients with CML often have increased num bers ol less mature leukocytes, including band tbrms and myelocytes in the peripheral blood. The modest neutrophilia with a normal diflerential, normal peripheral blood smear, and absence of symptoms make smoking or other benign cause a much more likely cause in this patient. Inf'ections are a common cause of leukocytosis. and bacterial infections can cause neutrophilia with a left shitt or presence of'bands, metamyelocytes, or other immature granulocytes in the circulation (Option B). Other findings can include toxic granulations or Dohle bodies seen in circulating neutrophils on review of the peripheral blood smear. In certain severe infections, the leukocyte count can be as high as 1O0,O00/pL (1O0 x fOq/L). Some bacteria are associated with more significant neutrophilia. including clostridial infections. This patient is asymptomatic and has a normal peripheral blood smear, so occult inf'ection is an unlikely cause of his neutrophilia. Some medications can cause an increase in the abso lute neutrophil count. Glucocorticoids cause an increase in release of neutrophils from the bone nrarrort Ml,eloid growth factors (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and lithium are other drugs associated w'ith an increased abso lute neutrophil count.

The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next is bone marrow biopsy (Option A). This patient has symptom atic macrocytic anemia. She has a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation, both of which are independently associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), so evaluation by bone marrow biopsy will provide key information to confirm the suspicion for therapy- related MDS. Patients who develop MDS often present with macrocytic (and often symptomatic) anemia. Bone marrow biopsy aids in establishing the diagnosis and provides prog nostic information, including assessment of the percentage of marrow blasts and cytogenetics. If therapy related MDS is conflrmed, the patient may be evaluated for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although some experts believe that therapy related MDS is a high-risk con dition independent of cytogenetic abnormalities, obtaining cytogenetic and genetic information may identify a target for novel therapies. Colonoscopy is indicated in the evaluation ofiron defl ciency anemia in most men and in postmenopausal women b l,lo ET L'T' a5 l,I (I, =vtE 93  Answers and Critiques (Option B). Macrocytic anemia and concomitant leukopenia and thrombocytopenia would be inconsistent'*,ith iron defl ciency, so colonoscopy would be of little help in evaluating this patient. Immune-mediated hemolysis is characterized by antibody binding to erythrocytes causing complement- mediated and phagocy.te mediated destruction. The lab- oratory hallmark of immune-mediated hemolysis is a positive direct antiglobulin test that detects either IgG or complement (C3) on the erythrocyte surface (Option C). Patients with immune-mediated hemolysis may have ane- mia, fatigue, dyspnea, jaundice, splenomegaly, and reticu- loc1.tosis. Pancytopenia would not be an expected flnding. This patient has pancytopenia and a low reticulocyte count, which are not consistent with immune-mediated hemolysis. A low mean corpuscular volume, elevated red cell dis- tribution width, and peripheral blood smear showing micro- cltosis and anisopoikilocytosis are virtually diagnostic of iron deficiency, especially in premenopausal women. This patient has a macrocytic anemia, and the leukopenia and thrombocy topenia cannot be explained by iron deflcienry.

No further management is needed for this patient (Option E). She has a hemoglobin level greater than 16 g/dl (160 g/L), a low erythropoietin level, and presence of the /AK2 V617F mutation that meet diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV). Some patients may be asymptomatic, with the diagno- sis suspected by flndings on routine complete blood counts; however, many patients have symptoms of fatigue, head- ache, or itching, particularly after a warm shower (aqua genic pruritus). Accompanying splenomegaly may present with abdominal fullness, reflux, or early satiety. Unless con- traindicated, all patients with PV should undergo phlebot- omy to maintain a hematocrit level less than 45'l"" and be treated with low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Additional management depends on risk stratification ofthe patient. This patient's age (<60 years) and lack of thrombosis history categorize her as low risk. Patients at low risk need no additional therapy. Cytoreductive therapy is added for patients with high risk PV. u,hich includes those older than 60 years or r.r'ith a history of thrombosis. Cytoreductive options in PV include hydroxyurea and interferon-a (Options A, C). Ruxolitinib has also been shown to be an effective treatment in those who are intolerant of flrst line agents or with resistant PV (Option D).

A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is the most appropriate choice for this patient (Option C). Her presentation is con- sistent with an acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), most likely warm AIHA (WAIHA). In WAIHA, a polyclonal autoantibody interacts with multiple erythroc,'te antigens, causing extravascular hemolysis. The autoantibody is typically IgG. although it can rarely be IgM or lgA. Splenic macrophages phagocytize the IgG on the erythrocyte. as well as a portion of the membrane, resulting in spherocy'te formation. Patients have evidence of hemolysis, including anemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase level, low hapto globin level, and an indirect bilirubinemia. Reticulocytosis is also seen if no concomitant processes are present that could blunt the compensatory bone marrow response (e.g., iron deflciency). Approximately half of patients with WAIHA will have another underlying disease process. including viral infections, lymphoproliferative diseases. and other autoim mune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

Therefore, evaluating the ADAM1'S13 activity would not be helpful (Option A). ADAMTS13 activity would be expected to be low in the presence of an inhibitor, as in thrombotic thrombocytopen ic pu rpura. A bone marrow biopsy would not be helpful at this time because the patient's increased reticulocyte count and evi dence ofhemolysis indicates a peripheral destructive process causing anemia rather than a defect in the bone marrow (Option B). Osmotic fragility testing is often used to evaluate for hereditary spherocytosis (Option D). 'lhe test uses hypotonic saline incubation to evaluate for increased sensitivity o1' spherocytic erythrocytes to hemolysis. The osmotic ttagil ity test has a relatively low sensitivity ancl specilicity, with positive results being seen in numerous other conditions, including AIHA.'lhe absence of a family history and onset of symptomatic hemolysis at the age of 32 years argue against hereditary spherocy.tosis.

The patient should start granulocy.te colony stimulating fac tor (G CSF) with his next cycle of chemotherapy (Option C). Febrile neutropenia is defined as a single fever of 38.3 'C (101 'F) or sustained fever of 38 'C (100.4'F) in a patient with a current or anticipated absolute neutrophil count less than 500/pL (0.5 x 10e/L). Chemotherapy,induced neutropenia typically occurs within 5 to 15 days lollowing chemother apy. G CSF and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor can be given prophylactically to patients receiving chemotherapy that carries a high risk of neutropenia and as secondary prophylaxis in patients with a previous episode of febrile neutropenia. G CSF administered on day 2 ol the next chemotherapy cycle should reduce the risk ofanother neutropenic f'ever episode. G CSF is not indicated for most patients with neutropenia who are afebrile, as a routine adjunct to empiric antibiotics lor patients presenting with f'ebrile neutropenia, or fbr patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.

The structural erythrocyte changes lead to less defbrmability in the microcirculation and increase phago cytosis by macrophages, mainly in the spleen, resulting in hemolysis. Splenomegaly is common. Laboratory flndings include anemia, reticulocytosis, signs of hemolysis. and an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The clinical severity of I-lS varies considerably. Mild forms are common, with normal or near normal hemoglobin lev els, and patients can compensate for the hemolysis. Those with severe forms har,e more brisk hemolysis and a greater degree of anemia, which often worsens at times of oxida tive stress, such as viral infections; pigmented gallstones and aplastic crises from parvovirus infections can also be seen. Treatment depends on disease severity. Mild forms can be monitored. Patients with HS, as with other hemolytic states, have increased folate requirements and should receive supplemental folate. A typical dose for moderate to severe hemolysis is 1to 2 mgiday. In warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. pathogenic lgG antibodies are directed against Rh type antigens on the erythrocyte surface. IgG-coated erythrocytes can be completely phagocytized by splenic macrophages via the Fc receptor and are cleared from the circulation. The basic principle of therapy is alleviating immune destruction of erythrocytes by halting antibody production using gluco corticoids or rituximab (Options B, C). Intravenous immune globulin may be used as adjunctive therapy by blocking mac rophage Fc receptors and preventing erythrocyte destruction in the spleen. Because HS is the result of deficiencies of the erythrocyte membrane proteins and not autoantibodies, prednisone or rituximab is not helpfut. Splenectomy is considered in patients with HS and more signiflcant anemia because the spleen is the pri mary location for erythrocy.te destruction (Option D). Most patients who undergo splenectomy experience an improved hemoglobin level and reduced degree of hemolysis. Typical indications for splenectomy include transfusion dependence or severe symptoms related to anemia. C)ther considerations may include abdominal symptoms related to splenomegaly. I( EY PO I TTS r Patients with mild forms of hereditary spherocytosis can be monitored and should receive supplemental folate. . Splenectomy is an effective treatment for severe hereditary spherocytosis (transfusion dependence, symptomatic anemia, massive splenomegaly).",B

The most likely diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenic purpura (lTP) (Option C). ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. although it is oFten difficult to distinguish from gestational thrombocytopenia when the thrombocytopenia is mild or noted later in pregnancy. However, features suggesting ITP include earlier presentation (flrst trimester). lower platelet count nadir (<zo,ooo/pL [zo x to""rL]), and history ofthrom bocytopenia befbre pregnancy (even if it was only mild). If the platelet count remains greater than 30.000 pL (30 x 10""/L). the pregnancy is not at risk. Patients should receive intravenous immune globulin or glucocorticoids at any time during pregnancy if the platelet count decreases to less than 30,000/gl- (30 x 10e/L). Because she does not have significant bleeding and her platelet count is greater than 30,000/pL (30 x 10'q/L), she requires no intervention at this time. She will need close follow-up. Gestational thrombocytopenia affects approximately 5'7, of pregnant women (Option A). 'lhe cause is uncertain. Most patients are asymptomatic, with platelet counts greater than 100,000/pL (100 x 10e/L) typical, although platelet counts mav occasionally reach a nadir of 70,000/[L (70 x 10elL). The platelet count does not decrease until late in ges- tation. The fetus is unaffected, intervention is unnecessary. and platelet counts spontaneously return to normal after delivery. The patient's earlier presentation and lower platelet count argue against gestational thrombocytopenia. HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets) syndrome is a thrombotic microangiopathy of preg nancy manifbsting as a severe complication of preeclampsia (Option B). HELLP syndrome typically presents with nonspe ciflc symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea with vomit ing, pruritus, and jaundice, with schistocytes on the periph eral blood smear. HELLP syndrome would be unlikely to cause thrombocytopenia at 16 weeks' gestation, usually pre senting in the latter part of the third trimester. The patient's clinical presentation is not compatible with HELLP syndrome. The patient has no evidence for a microangiopathic hemolysis (no schistocytes on peripheral blood smear) or other symptoms frequently associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura such as fever. fluctuating mental status, or abnormal kidney function (Option D).

Patients may present in the accelerated (10% 19'l. blasts) or blast phase (>20'1, blasts) of the disease, with blast phase resembling features seen with acute leukemia, but most patients present in the chronic phase (<10'U, blasts in the bone marrow). The hallmark of CML is the Philadel phia chromosome, a reciprocal translocation of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 to the BCR gene on chromosome 22. Patients often present with constitutional symptoms that include night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue, and splenomegaly is common; laboratory studies frequently show marked leukocytosis with a left shift, and basophilia and thrombocytosis can be seen. First line treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as imatinib is con- sidered accepted care for patients with CML in the chronic phase. TKIs bind to the BCR ABL oncoprotein and prevent downstream signaling. Other TKIs include nilotinib and dasatinib. Availability of TKIs has dramatically changed outcomes in CML, with the S-year overall survival in CML exceeding 90'1,. Hydroxyurea is a nonspeciflc myelosuppressive agent that is eflective at reducing granulocyte, erythroc),te, and platelet production in myeloproliferative neoplasms (Option A). It can be used as a temporizing measure to reduce peripheral blood counts while awaiting a flnal diagnosis. However, in those with a conflrmed diagnosis of CML, TKIs are more disease specific and preferred over hydroxyurea. Induction chemotherapy is only considered in some patients with CML in the blast phase (Option C). It would not be appropriate first-line therapy for those with CML in the chronic phase. Stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative option for CML but has signiflcant associated morbidity and mortality (Option D). With the eflicacy and safety of TKIs, the need for transplantation has been substantially reduced. It is typically only considered in patients in the blast phase or in younger patients who do not respond to TKIs. t(EY P0rlrrs .

(A) Factor VIII inhibitor titer (B) Factor Xl level (C) Factor XII level (D) Mixing study","Answer:  D Educational Objective: Evaluate a patient with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Evaluation of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) begins with a mixing study in r,r,hich equal parts of a patient's plasma and control plasma are combinedr the aPTT assay is performed immediately following the mix and again tbllowing an incubation period (Option D). The imme diate mixing study will not correct in the presence of most factor inhibitors. Some ir.rl.ribitors, specifically factor VIII inhibitor, will correct immediately but u,ill not correct alter incubation. Therefbre, mixing study results should always be reported immediately and after incubation. The result of the mixing study for this patient will help to determine the general cause of the prolonged aPTT (factor deficiency versus inhibitor) and to guide the subsequent, more specific evaluation. Because this patient has an autoimmune disor der, a lupus anticoagulant might explain the prolonged aPTT without evident bleedingr it is characterized by a prolonged aPTT that fails to correct when mixed with control plasma. Patients with a lupus anticoagulant may be asymptomatic; however, approximately 30'7, of patients with a lupus anti coagulant may develop arterial andror venous thrombosis. Factor VIII inhibitors can arise in the setting of hemo philia A, following exposure to factor VIII replacement therapy, or can develop spontaneously in the setting of' autoimmune disease, malignancy. pregnancy. and certain medications. Weak, low titer inhibitors may not cause spon taneous bleeding. The presence of a factor VIII inhibitor is suspected when a mixing study demonstrates immediate correction of the prolonged aPTT after mixing but subse quent prolongation of the aPTT tbllowing incubation. Eval uation of factor VIII levels and inhibitor titers would be prompted only if this sequence of events is demonstrated on the mixing study (Option A). Factor XI deficiency can result in a bleeding diathesis because factor XI is activated by thrombin.

The most appropriate management is allogeneic hemato poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Option A). This patient developed secondar), or therapl'related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) follor,r,ing breast cancer treatment. A primary AML diagnosis is often sufncient to recommend allogeneic HSCT. but therapy related AML is even more likely to relapse and is an indication for HSCT. The patient's age. lack of comorbidities, and apparent remission after recent induction chemotherapy further support the indica tion for allogeneic HSCT. Patients undergo Hl-A typing. ancl siblings are considered for stem celldonation: Hl-A matched unrelated donors may also be a reasonable option. Patients in first remission can have similar outcomes using alterna tive donors, represented by haploidentical transplantations (half matched relatives, such as parent donating to child or vice versa or siblings $,ho share a haploq'pe) or umbilical cord blood transplantations. Patients with AML who initially achieve complete remis sion will relapse unless additional postremission therapf is provided. Postremission therapl, is intended to eliminate undetectable disease to achieve cure. or at least long ternt control of the disease. Postremission therapy is divided into consolidation and maintenance treatment phases. Consoli dation treatment consists of intensive treatment soon after the attainment of complete remission (Option B). Consolida tion with conventionaI chemotherapy would be indicated in managing patients at low risk with AI\4L. Low risk includes 100  l. patients with no previous chemotherapy exposure cncl those without genetic mutations or with select mutations (e.g., NPMI mutated AML) that are associated with improved prognosis. Treatment ol the central nervous system (CNS) with intrirthecal chemotherapy and whole brain irradiation is routinely employed and improves outcomes in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia because the CNS, even in asymptomatic patients, harbors malignant cells that are resistant to systemic chemotherapy (Option C). The same benefit in improving remission rates and survival is not seen in patients with AML. Maintenance chemotherapy is not the best option in patients with higher risk AML, good response to initial ther apy, ancl good overall health (Option D). It may be consid ered in older patients in whom allogeneic HSCT would be potentially too toxic (e.g., older than 75 80 years).

Clinical prediction scores have a moderate ability to predict patient outcomes and do not replace clinical judgment. Howevet they may help to select patients at low risk for complications. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and simplified PESI have been most widely validated. This recommendation does not apply to patients who have other conditions that would require hospitalization, have limited or no support at home, and cannot aflord medications or have a history of poor adherence. The simplified PESI assigns 1 point for each of the following: age older than 80 years, history of cardiopulmonary disease, history of cancer, pulse rate 110/min or greater, systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation less than 9O""/,,. lf none of these criteria are met, the patient is considered low risk, with a 30 day mortality of 1.1'l""; these patients can be considered fbr home anticoag ulation treatment with either rivaroxaban or apixaban. This patient meets none of the risk criteria, and treatment at home is reasonable. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are both approved for mono- therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE; deep venous thrombosis and PE). Dabigatran has not been approved for monotherapy of VTE; treatment must be preceded by hep- arin, preferably low molecular-weight heparin (Option A). Thrombolytic therapy is recommended for patients with massive PE and shock related to low cardiac output. This patient does not require thrombolytic therapy (Option C). Intravenous anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) would require hospital admission, and intravenous UFH would not be the ideal anticoagulant because of the potential delay in reaching therapeutic levels and the variations in bio availability.

The most likely diagnosis is drug induced neutropenia (Option C). Neutropenia is deflned as a circulating absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500/pL (t.S x tOe/L); severe neutrope nia is an ANC less than SOO/pL (0.5 x 10e/L).

Degree of neutropenia, tt(l, ET t,!t (, Ut e, =vt tr 103  D U,tlD t, o, â‚¬Lr) lt tD ,rt Answers and Critiques acuity of onset, and presence of other abnormalities in the complete blood count, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, are helpful in differentiirting the potential cause. Review of medications is important in the evaluation of neutropenia because medications are a common cause. Drug induced neu tropenia results from impairment ol normal granulopoiesis in the bone marow or through a drug dependent. antibody mediated immune destruction of circulating neutrophils. The thionamides propylthiouracil and methimazole are among the drugs known to cause agranulocytosisl although the overall prevalence is low (around 0.5'2,), the risk is higher compared with other drug classes. Agranulocytosis is more likely to occur within the first 3 months of drug initiation, is more common in women, and appears to be dose related with methimazole. The ANC should recover within 1 to 3 weeks after discontinu ing the medication. Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is more common in patients of African descent (Option A). Estimates are that approximately 4'2, of Blacks in the United States have BEN. Patients with BEN are asymptomatic, and its presence does not increase risk for infections. It is associated with a persistent, mild to moderate degree of neutropenia, rarely with an ANC less than 1000/pl. (1 x 100/L). This patient's degree ofneutrope nia is much greater than would be expected with BEN. Cyclic neutropenia is a rare genetic cause of symptom atic neutropenia that recurs every 3 weeks (Option B). The neutropenia can be severe (<200/pL [o.z x toerL])l lasts for 2 to 3 days; and is associated with recurrent fever, oral ulcer ations, and infections. ln this patient, the recent initiation of methimazole is a more likely cause of neutropenia. Vitamin B,, is necessary for DNA synthesis and can be associated with pancytopenia. Vitamin B,, deflciency is more likely to occur in those who are vegetarians because vitamin B,, is not found in plant based foods.

The most appropriate test to perform next is abdominal fat pad biopsy (Option A). This patient likely has light chain Answers and Critiques (AL) amyloidosis. These light chains can deposit in the kid ney, heart, skin, liver, and other organs. Soft tissue mani f'estations are present in 30'7, to 40'l, of patients and include generalized waxy appearance; easy bruising with minor pressure (pinch purpura) ; periorbital ecchymoses (""raccoon eyes,"" shown);yellow waxy papules and plaques, especially in a periorbital location; dystrophic nails; and macroglossia. He also has an IgG l"" monoclonal gammopathy detectable in the serum, which further confirms a plasma cell dyscrasia. Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy that demonstrates charac teristic apple green birelringence with Congo red staining. Fat pad biopsy is pref'erred even in multiorgan involvement because it is less invasive than biopsying other organs (sen sitivity, 60""/,,-80""/.,).lf unrevealing, kidney, bone marrow or other organ biopsy can be performed (Option C). Protein typing using mass spectrometry is important to identiff the speciflc protein causing amyloidosis. Proper identification of the amyloid type is key fbr deciding optimal management. All patients with amyloidosis are evaluated for extent of organ involvement. Cardiac involvement is common with AL amyloidosis, and evaluation with echocardiography, electro- cardiography, N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide, and serum troponin T is commonly perfbrmed. Cardiac MRI is more sensitive than echocardiography and has a distinctive pattern. Iffat pad or other organ biopsies are not feasible, an endomyocardial biopsy can be perfbrmed to establish the diag nosis but should not be the initial diagnostic test (Option B).

(A) Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (B) Antithymocyteglobulin (C) Azacytidine (D) Intravenous immune globulin","Answer: A Educational Objective: Treat aplastic anemia. The most effective treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with an HLA matched sib Iing (Option A). The blood and bone marrow findings are consistent with aplastic anemia, an acquired hematopoi- etic stem cell disorder characterized by severely decreased bone marrow cellularity and pancytopenia. Although it is classifled as an anemia, patients usually have a combina tion of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The bone marrow typically shows marked hypocellularity with a commensurate increase in fat tissue. Typically, no dysplastic features of cell maturation are seen, as would be seen in the hypocellular variant of myelodysplastic syndrome, or an increase in cellularity and immature leukocytes, as would be seen in ""aleukemic"" acute leukemia. Younger patients with a suitable HLA matched donor are usually treated with allogeneic HSCT. With advances in immunosuppression and supportive care, the overall survival of young patients fol- lowing HSCT with a good risk proflle is greater than 80%. Most aplastic anemia is felt to be related to stem cell autoimmunity. In patients older than 50 years and in younger patients without a suitable stem cell donor, autoimmune aplastic anemia is treated by immunosuppression with anti thymoqte globulin, cyclosporine, and prednisone (Option B). Allogenic HSCT is preferred in this younger patient. Azacytidine or other hypomethylating agents may be useful in managing symptomatic patients with myelodys plastic syndrome, decreasing transfusion requirements and delaying conversion to acute leukemia. Azacytidine is not used in managing aplastic anemia (Option C). Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is useful in treat- ing pure red cell aplasia, which is characterized by normo c).tic or macrocl.tic anemia with decreased reticulocltes and absent or decreased erythrocyte precursors in the bone mar- row. Parvovirus B19 is cytotoxic to the erythrocyte precur sors in the bone marrow. Immunocompromised patients can have sustained viremia leading to prolonged anemia requir ing IVIG treatment to hasten viral clearance and recover erythrocyte production.

The most appropriate management of this patient in addi tion to withholding warfarin is observation (Option E). He has an elevated INR on routine laboratory testing but no signs or symptoms of bleeding. Bleeding risk increases as the INR increases. Additionally, patients older than 75 years, those with previous cerebrovascular accidents, and those with previous gastrointestinal bleeding are at increased risk of bleeding independent of the INR. Bleeding risk is elevated to a higher degree in patients taking concomitant aspirin. clopidogrel, or other antiplatelet agents. If a patient's INR is between 4.5 and 10, warfarin must be withheld until the INR retums to the therapeutic range; without bleeding, no other treatment is required, and observation is recommended. lf the INR is greater than 10 without any bleeding, then vitamin K is recommended in addition to withholding warfarin (Option D). ln any patient taking warfarin with an elevated INR who presents with life threatening bleeding, then warfarin is withheld, and vitamin K and a prothrombin complex con- centrate (PCC) should be administered (Option A). The PCC may be 3 factor (containing factors ll, IX, and X) or 4 factor (containing factors Il, VII, IX, and X), although 4 factor PCC is preferred because of more predictable warfarin reversal. Factor VIIa is used to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia (Option B). It plays no role in warfarin reversal. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not the preferred agent when treatment of life threatening bleeding is necessary for a patient with a supratherapeutic INR (Option C). 4-Factor PCC has been found to be noninferior to FFP in the treat ment of life threatening bleeding. Additionally, 4 factor PCC has a faster infusion time, more rapid reversal of INR, and lower risk of volume overload. For these reasons, 4 factor PCC is the preferred agent for warfarin reversal when a reversal agent is necessary. XEY POIilTS o In patients taking warfarin with a supratherapeutic INR less than 10 and no signs ofbleeding, warfarin should be withheld until the INR returns to the therapeutic range. o For INR elevation greater than 10 without bleeding, vitamin K is recommended in addition to withholding warfarin; if the INR is elevated and life-threatening bleeding is present, then warfarin is withheld, and vitamin K and a prothrombin complex concentrate should be administered.",D

The remainder of the vital signs and physical examina tion are unremarkable.","Answer: B Educational Objective: Diagnose anemia of kidney disease. Anemia of kidney disease is the most likely diagrosis (Option B). The increased serum creatinine level and the small echo genic kidneys seen on the ultrasound support this diagno- sis. The anemia, resulting fiom ery.thropoietin deflciency, is normochromic and hypoprolilbrative (a normal or low retic ulocyte count despite moderate anemia), and erythrocytes typically have normal morpholory on peripheral blood smear. Some patients with uremia may demonstrate echi nocytes on the peripheral blood spear characterized by small, uniform spikes on the erythrocyte surface. A low or low-normal serum erythropoietin level is typical, and initi- ating erythropoietin-stimulating agents results in a robust improvement of anemia in the absence of concomitant iron deficiency. The anemia of kidney disease is more prevalent and more severe among patients with more severe kidney disease, especially ifit is advanced enough to warrant dialysis. The anemia of inflammation can occur with chronic inf'ections, cancer, or autclimmune inflammatory conditions and results from elevated interleukin 6 and other inflam matory cytokines that up regulate hepcidin (Option A). tlepcidin elevation limits iron absorption from enterocytes and reduces iron binding capacity and is characterized by low serum iron and total iron-binding capacity levels with a normal or elevated serum ferritin level. This patient's history and iron studies do not support anemia of inflammation. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) is asso- ciated with elevated reticulocyte count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and schistocy.tes on the peripheral blood smear (Option C). MAHA may be associated with lilb threatening conditions such as thrombotic thrombocy.topenic purpura, disseminated intravas- cular coagulation, malignant hypertension, or malfunctioning cardiac valves or left ventricular assist devices. This patient has no underlying condition associated with MAHA, and the peripheral blood smear does not support this diagnosis.

Hydroxyurea plus aspirin is the most appropriate treat ment for this patient (Option B). Her diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia (ET) is based on the presence of the IAK2 V6l7F mutation and elevated platelet count with normal leukocyte count and hemoglobin level. ET is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm, with the lAK2muia tion being the most common, occurring in approximately 50% to 60% of patients; the CAL-R mutation is seen in 25u1, to 35'/"" of patients, and 5'2, have the MPI mutation. Patients with ET and an underlying -IAK2 mutation are at higher risk for developing thrombotic complications than those with the CAL R or MPL mutations, and aspirin is recom- mended in this population. Aspirin is also recommended for those older than 60 years regardless of mutation sta- tus. Cytoreductive therapy, which is aimed at decreasing the platelet count, is accepted care in those older than 60 years, as well as those with a history of thrombo- sis regardless of age. Cytoreductive medications include hydroxyurea, interferon, and anagrelide. Hydroxyurea is often used initially because of its tolerability and efflcacy. Because the myelosuppressive effects are not speciflc to platelets, it is necessary to monitor fbr leukopenia and anemia. Because this patient is older than 60 years, hydroxyurea should be included in the treatment plan. Aspirin alone would be insufficient (Option A). Ruxolitinib is an oral lAKl/lAK2 inhibitor approved for use in polycythemia vera and myeloflbrosis (Option C). It has been shown to be e{Iective at reducing spleen vol ume and symptom burden in these diseases, but it is not approved for use in ET. Stem cell transplantation is the only curative option in BCR-ABt-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Option D). However, stem cell transplantation has an associated mortality risk and signiflcant potential mor bidity. Therefore, it is not considered in patients with ET or polycythemia vera because prognosis in these diseases is generally excellent with other therapies. Stem cell trans- plantation is typically reserved for those with higher risk myeloflbrosis whose prognosis is otherwise estimated to be poor. t(EY P0lilrs .

Calculation of the Khorana score should be done as the initial step in managing venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in this patient (Option A). According to the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncologr guideline on WE prevention and treatment in patients with cancer, routine pharmacologic thrombopro phylaxis should not be oflbred to all outpatients w.ith cancer. Increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer is measured using the Khorana score. The guideline recommends that high risk outpatients with cancer (l(horana score of 2 or higher before starting a new systemic chemotherapy regimen) may be of Ibred thromboprophyLuis with aplraban, rivaroxaban, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) provided no significant risk factors for bleeding and no drug interactions are identified. Con sideration of such therapy should be accompanied by a discus sion with the patient about the relative beneflts and harms. drug cost, and duration of prophylrrxis in this setting. The Khorana score places highest risk of VTE on gastric and pancreatic cancers (2 points), with llnnphoma and lung, gmecologic, bladder, and testicular cancers also being high risk (1 point). An additional point is given for BMI greater than 35, platelet count greater than 350,000/[L (350 x 10e/L). hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dl (100 g/L), and leukocy'te count greater than 11,000iUL (11 x 10e/L). During this patient's visit, data should be collected to calculate the score. and the results should be used to initiate a discussion regarding VTE prophylaxis benelits and harms. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and LMWH are recommended fbr VTE prophylaxis in patients with cancer at high risk for VTE who are about to start a new chemotherapeutic regi men (Options B, C). However, befbre starting either of'these agents, the patient's risk fbr VTE should be estimated by calculating the Khorana score. Even in patients'nvith cancer at high risk for VTE. war farin would not be the appropriate treatment choice (Option D). Data do not support the use of warfarin in the primary prophylaxis of VTE in patients with cancer. In those with cancer and active VTE disease, LMWH compared with war f'arin was associated with a reduction in the rate of recurrent VTE at 6 months (9""/,, vs 17""1,) and was not associated with an increased rate of major bleeding (0""1, vs q']l\ or olerall mor tality (39'1, vs 41'1,). In patients with cancer, warfarin is not generally recommended fbr either primary VTE prophylaxis or treatment, although its use may be considered in patients with multiple myeloma at high risk who are treated with thalidomide, lenalidomide. or pomalidomide combined with other agents such as glucocorticoids, doxorubicin, or erythropoietin. In these patients, LMWH may be preferred. t(tY PoltT .

Patients olten remain translusion independent during childhood and young adulthood but require trans fusions beginning in the third and fourth decacles of life. Heightened gastrointestinal absorption of iron that accom panies ineflective erythropoiesis adds to the transfusion related iron overload. Excess iron deposition in the organs can lead to arrhythmia and heart failure. cirrhosis and portal hypertension. and endocrinopathies (diabetes. hypo pituitarism. hypogonadism). Patients should avoid iron supplementation. and transfusions should be performed judiciously. Patients with secondary iron overload require chelation therapy with parenteral desferrioxamine or oral iron chelators (deferasirox or deferiprone) befbre the onset ofend organ damage.

'[he most appropriate diagnostic tests are HIV and hepatitis C virus (Option C). This patient has acute immune throm bocytopenic purpura (lTP). The initial evaluation for patients with t'fP should include testing fbr tllV and hepatitis C virus because thrombocy.topenia may be the initial presenting sign in these infections. Patients with HIV infection may have ITP independent of HIV viral load or CD4 cell count and may be otherwise asymptomatic. Although many patients with hep atitis C have symptoms, they are nonspecific and may not be clirectly related to the viral inf'ection but rather to associated comorbid conditions. Testing for Ilelicobacter pylori may also be reasonable if the patient is from an endemic region. Testing for systemic lupus erythematosus would be appropriate if the patient reported symptoms such as arthralgia, pleuritic chest pain, photosensitiviff, or rash or had other cytopenias or evidence of kidney disease. Because none of these is present, antinuclear antibody and comple r.nent level testing is not necessary (Option A).

The most likely cause of this patient's anemia is an impaired ability to absorb vitan-rin B,, resulting in ineffective eryth ropoiesis and megaloblastic anemia (Option C). Anemia associated with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indi rect bilirubin, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels without an elevated reticulocyte count suggests ineffective erythropoiesis, which, in the presence of Srpical morpho- logic findings (macrocytosis, macro ovalocytes, and hyper segmented neutrophils as shown in the peripheral blood smear), suggests vitamin B,, or fblate deflciency. Vitamin B,, absorption depends on various factors (gastric acidity, presence ofR binders, intrinsic tactor production by gastric parietal cells, presence of pancreatic proteases, and intrin sic factor vitamin 8,, complex absorption in the ileum).

The most commonly encountered organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichio coli presenting as sinusitis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infec- tions. Because of the altered immune state associated with MM, pneumococcal vaccination with the 13-valent pneumo coccal conjugate vaccine followed at least B weeks later by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be provided in accordance with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines. Ideally, immunization with inactivated vaccines should be provided at least 2 weeks before initiation of chemotherapy. In addition, annual influ enza vaccination with standard-dose killed vaccine should be administered to all patients with MM and to household members. Response to vaccinations may be suboptimal, but vaccination still provides beneflt and is recommended for all patients with MM. Many medications, such as proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) and monoclonal antibodies, are associated with an increased risk ofherpes zoster virus reactivation.

Besides smoking cessation and adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation, no further management is needed at this time (Option E). This patient has erythrocytosis, likely resulting from smoking and obstructive sleep apnea. His erythropoietin level is high normal, and he is negative for the lAK2Y677F mutation, which strongly indicates a secondary cause of erythrocyto sis. Primary polycythemia vera (PV) is often characterized by an elevated erythrocyte mass and a low erythropoietin level, and approximately 95% of patients have the JAK2 mutation, resulting in overproduction of erythrocytes, granulocytes, and platelets. Secondary erythrocytosis is more common, with hypoxia-induced reactive increases in erythrocyte production often being the underlying cause. This is seen with conditions such as COPD and sleep disordered breathing such as obstructive sleep apnea. Car bon monoxide exposure and chronic hypoxia associated with cigarette smoking are also secondary causes of eryth- rocytosis. This patient should stop smoking, overcome obstacles for use of CPAP ventilation. and continue to be monitored. Bone marrow biopsy is rarely indicated in evaluating erythrocytosis (Option A). The bone marrow in patients with PV will typically show hypercellularity with an increase in megakaryocytes and erythroid and myeloid precursors; the marrow may also reveal increased flbrosis. Even if PV is suspected, diagnosis is usually confirmed without the need of bone marrow evaluation.

(A) Antithrombin (B) FactorV Leiden (C) Proteins C and S (D) No additional testing","Answer: D Ed u cational Objective: Avoid inappropriate thrombo- philia testing in patients with acute venous thromboem- trolism. No hereditary thrombophilia testing perlormed now will inform immediate treatment decisions (Option D). Although identiflcation ol the inherited thrombophilias has advanced the understanding ol venous thromboem bolism (WE) pathophysiolog,l it has little influence on clinical management. which does not differ acutcly based on the presence of an inherited thrombophilia. Manage ment duration is typically determined by r,r,hether the V'l'E event was provoked by a reversible or self limited insult. In this patient with an unprovoked deep renous thrombosis, guidelines suggest that extcnded anticoagulant therapy should be considered regardless of the presence or absence of an inherited thrombophilia. Ihe choice of extended thromboprophylaxis should be informed b1, blecding risk and reevalualed each year. The choice of anticoagulant may be influenced by the presence of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. but this patient's antiphospholipid evaluation was unremarkable. Antithrombin III (ATIIl) is a natural anticoagulant that can lead to thrombophilia in the setting ol an inherited or acquired deficiency. the prevalence of inherited AI'lll defi ciency is approximately 1 in 3000 to 5000 persons and leads to a strong predisposition fbr VTE. ATIII is reduced during an acute VTE, and measurement at this time nould not provide useful information (Option A). Factor V Leiden (FVL) is the most common inherited thrombophilia (Option B). Approximatell' 5'11, of White patients are heterozygous lor FVL. Less than l'X, of Whites are homozygous fbr the mutation. This mutation is rare in Asians. Africans. Black Americans. and American Indians. F\'L can be detected by genetic testing (DNA testing) or a functional coagulation test for acti\ated protein C resistance. Although genetic testing nolr,nould not affect immediate treatment options for this patient, testing can be perfbrmed independent of the presence of an acute thrombosis. Ther- ap1' rrith a direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban, dabig- atran) or an oral factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban. edoxaban. rivaroxaban) can result in falsely normal activated protein C functional test results. Proteins C and S are vitamin K dependent proteins that degrade activated factors V and \tlll (Option C). lnher ited deficiencies arc generally associated r,r'ith thromboses before the age o1'50 years and are associated u'ith a strong family history ol thrombosis. These proteins are also reduced in the setting of acute \'TE. and measurement nou' u'ould not provide usetul infbrmation or influence immediate treatment. f,EY POIilIt o The acute management of patients with venous thromboembolism does not differ based on the pres- ence or absence of an inherited thrombophilia; there- fore, testing is not necessary. o Treatment duration for venous thromboembolism disease is typically determined by whether the event was provoked by a reversible or self-limited insult and not by the presence or absence ofthrombophilia.",B

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Ehlers-Danlossyndrome (B) Hemophilia A carrier (C) Immunethrombocytopenicpurpura (D) von Willebrand disease","Answer: D Educational Objective: Diagnose von Willebrand disease. The most likely cause of this patient's bruising and menor- rhagia is von Willebrand disease (vWD) (Option D). vWD, the most common hereditary bleeding disorder. is caused by deflciency or ineffectiveness of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF promotes platelet adhesion and functions as a protective carrier protein for factor Vlll, so a mild sec- ondary decrease in factor VIII level occurs in patients with vWD. vWF deficiency leads to mucocutaneous bleeding that mimics thrombocytopenia. Menorrhagia and bleeding after minor procedures such as dental extraction or tonsillectomy are common maniflestations. As in typical cases of vWD, this patient was young at the onset of bleeding symptoms and has a family history of bleeding. vWD is an autosomal dominant disease and can affect men and women, so her family history is also consistent with this diagnosis. Although the activated partial thromboplastin time may be tr 112  prolonged or normal, an abnorrrill platelet f'unction testing result would suggest vWD, nraking this a uselul initial eval uation tool. The diagnosis is confirnred by finding a reduc tior.r in von Willebrar.rd ar.rtigen (quar.rtitative analysis) and reduced vWF ristocetin cotactor activity (a measurement ot the functional affcct). Ehlers Danlos syndrome (liDS) describes a group of rare genetic disorders aflecting connective tissue and char- acterized by one of several f'eatures, including skin hyper elasticity. skin fragility, and joint hypermobility. all of which are absent in this patient. Bruising can be a common symp tom of EDS; however, EDS would not explain the mucocu taneous bleeding pattern or the laboratory abnormalities in this patient (Option A). Although a factor VIll level of 40',X, can be seen in car riers of hemophilia A, the patient's family history is incon sistent with this diagnosis (Option B). Ilemophilia A has an X linked recessive pattern of inheritance, with men being aflected and women remaining asymptomatic carriers. Platelet function testing would be normal in patients with hemophilia A. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is associated with a low platelet count but not a qualitative platelet abnormal, ity (Option C). The platelet count is normal. l(Ev P0tt{T5 . Von Willebrand disease, the most common hereditary bleeding disorder, is caused by either deficiency or ineffectiveness of von Willebrand factor. .

(A) Calculate the Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria SCOTE (B) CT angiography (C) D-dimermeasurement (D) Duplexultrasonography","Answer: D Educational Objective: Evaluate a patient with a high probability of deep venous thrombosis. According to Wells criteria for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), this patient has a high probability of DVT and should undergo duplex ultrasonography (Option D). The Wells cri teria include leg sympk)ms and examination findings as well as patient history. Flxamination findings and symptoms include calf swelling of ll cm or more, swollen unilateral superficial veins, ur.rilateral pitting edema, swelling of the entire leg, and localized tenderness along the deep venous system. Patient history criteria include previously docu mented DVT; active cancer or treatment of cancer in the past 6 months; paralysis, paresis, immobilization, or bedridden status for 3 days or more: and surgery. One point is given fbr Answers and Critiques each criterion that is present. If an alternative explanation for leg symptoms is present, then two points are removed. For patients with a score of 0 or l, a D dimer me.lsurement should be obtained; no additional testing is indicated fbr a negative D dimer result. For a Wells criteria score greater than 1, pretest probability of a DVT is high and duplex ultra sonography should be performed without initial D dinter evaluation. This patient's leg swetling with pitting edema and recent cancer therapy earn a Wells criteria score of 3, so duplex ultrasonography should be performed. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC) score can identify patients at very low risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) and is the recommended initial test fbr patients at low risk for PE (Option A). If the PERC score is zero, no D dimer testing is needed, and no CT angiography should be performed. However, this test is not applicable to a patient with suspected DVT, such as this patient. CT angiography is unnecessary because the patient has symptoms of a lower extremity DVT, not PE (Option B). If' duplex ultrasonography of the lower extremity is diagnostic for DVT, then CT angiography does not need to be per formed, because the treatment for DVT and PFI are the same and the risk associated with C'l'contrast can be avoided. ln patients with a high probability fbr DVT, the D dimer measurement should not be obtained (Option C).

(A) Hydroxyurea (B) Immune-mediated hemolltic anemia (C) Paroxysmalnocturnalhemoglobinuria (D) Vitamin Br2 deflciency","Answer: A Educational Objective: Diagnose hydroxyurea-induced macrocytic anemia. The most likely cause of this patient's macrocytic anemia is hydroxyurea therapy (Option A). Reviewing the com plete blood count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and reticulocyte count along with the peripheral blood smear can provide valuable diagnostic infbrmation when assess ing patients with anemia. The reticulocyte count provides information on the marrow response to anemia. A normal marrow will produce reticulocytes in response to anemia or hypoxia. ln contrast, patients with vitamin B,,,,, fblate, or iron deflciency or those with marrow cliseases such as myelo dysplasia or aplastic anemia have a low reticulocyte count for their degree of anemia. Most macrocytic anemias with MCV values greater than 110 to ll5 fl. are caused by vitamin I t I tt{, EF TJ .E, 'Etl (u 3 *7 113  (^ =G eh gt CL al 4l G IA Answers and Critiques B,, or folate deflciency, treatment of HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy, or the antimetabolite hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea prevents the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, halting the cell cycle at the Gl/S phase. This inhibition of ribonucleotide synthesis results in a myelosuppressive eflect and macrocytosis. Unlike vitamin B, deflciency, no intramedullary hemolysis occurs, so the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, and total bili rubin levels are normal. This patient's macrocltic anemia, mild leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common and expected consequences of hydroxyurea therapy. An elevated LDH level and reticulocyte count with spherocytes or microspherocytes on the peripheral blood smear would be expected in immune-mediated hemo- lytic anemia (Option B). this patient does not have these findings. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired, intrinsic erythrocyte defect arising from somatic mutations in the PIGA gene (Option C). Patients may pres ent with intravascular hemolysis or venous and arterial thrombosis. PNH is not a cause of macrocytosis to the degree seen in this patient. He also lacks a history of throm- bosis or laboratory conflrmation of hemolysis. Macrocy- tosis of 115 fL is more likely to be caused by hydroxyurea than PNH. A low vitamin B,, level is associated with intramed- ullary hemolysis because of ineffective erythropoiesis and resultant elevated LDH, haptoglobin, and bilirubin (indirect) levels, which are normal in this patient (Option D). Addi- tionally, vitamin B,, stores are abundant and can remain suf- ficient for a long time even in complete cessation of dietary intake. The development of macrocy.tosis over 1 year's time is more consistent with medication effect than vitamin B, deflciency. rtY Potilts .

The most appropriate management is to obtain cold agglu tinin titers (Option A). This patient's laboratory flndings are consistent with cold agllutinin hemolytic anemia. Cold agglutinins are IgM antibodies that can cause erythrocyte agglutination and hemolytic anemia, with extravascular hemolysis driven by complement flxation. In cold agglutinin disease, the direct antiglobulin test result is positive for anti complement (C:) and negative for anti IgG. Cold agpllutinin hemolytic anemia can arise as a primary process or second ary to an underlying condition such as infection, lympho proliferative disorders, or autoimmune disease. Mgcoplasma pneumoniae is a common infectious issue associated with development of cold agglutinins. This may arise because the organism causes alterations in antigens on the erythrocyte membrane to which IgM autoantibodies are directed. The hemolysis associated with M. pneumoniae is often mild and self limited. Based on her symptoms of cough and fever and their resolution with a macrolide. this patient may have had preceding M. pneumonioe infection. The presence of a cold agglutinin can be conflrmed by checking a titer, whereby the ability ofl the patient's serum to agglutinate erythrocytes is evaluated through serial dilutions. Some interest exists in developing anticomplement therapies for cold agglutinin disease, with promising agents directed at Cl and C3. Eculizumab is an anticomplement drug that targets C5, so it would not be as useful in cold agglutinin disease because the hemolysis occurs from earlier components in the complement pathway (Option B). Eculi zumab is approved for use in paroxysmal nocturnal hemo globinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndronte but not in cold agglutinin disease. Detection of CD55 and CD59 by flow cytometry would be appropriate ifPNH were a concern, but that is not the case with this patient whose direct antiglobulin test results are consistent with a cold agglutinin process (Option C). lf treatment for primary cold aggtutinin hemolytic anemia is needed, a rituximab based regimen is preferred.

The most appropriate management is to calculate the Pulmo nary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) score (Option C). Guidelines recommend using the PERC as the initial step in evaluating patients at low risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). The PERC includes eight criteria. With a PERC score of zero, D-dimer testing and CT angiography should not be performed. A meta-analysis of 12 studies showed that if the PERC is used, only 0.3'X, of PEs would be missed and 22""/,, of D-dimer testing would have been safely avoided. This patient meets no PERC criteria (score = 0), so he has a low pretest probability of PE and requires no additional PE-related testing. Age <50 y lnitial heart rate <100 beats/min lnitial oxygen saturation >947o on room air No unilateral leg swelling No hemoptysis No surgery or trauma within 4 weeks No history of venous thromboembolism No estrogen use In patients at low risk according to Wells criteria with a PERC score greater than zero, D-dimer testing should be performed (Option A). If D-dimer is negative, then no additional testing is required. If D-dimer is positive, further evaluation with imaging is merited. In a patient with a PERC score of zero, duplex imaging would not be appropriate to perform next; D dimer level should be measured instead (Option B). In patients with a PERC score greater than 0, duplex imaging may be necessary if the D dimer is elevated or the patient has a moderate to high pretest probability based on Wells criteria. Although PE is not the likely cause of his symptoms, this patient will require further testing to evaluate the cause of his dyspnea (Option D). For patients who present with symptoms suspicious for an acute PE, validated prediction rules have been developed to help effectively evaluate this condition. The Wells criteria for PE and the Geneva Score for PE are well studied tools in this setting. A subset of patients at very low risk can be identified using the PERC score. These prediction rules should be used to effectively and cost-efficiently evaluate suspected PE. TEY POIXTT o For patients who present with symptoms suspicious for an acute pulmonary embolism, validated predic- tion rules should be used to help effectively and cost efficiently evaluate this condition. o Patients with a Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria score ofzero have a very low pretest probability ofpul- monary embolism (PE) and require no further testing for PE.",Option3

Beginning oral iron replacement therapy every other day is the most appropriate management option for this patient (Option B). A low mean corpuscular volume, elevated red cell distribution width, and peripheral blood smear showing microcytosis and anisopoikilocytosis are virtually diagnostic of iron deflciency, especially in premenopausal women; these flndings may obviate the need for additional laboratory testing provided that a follow up blood count is performed to assess response to iron therapy. Even in developed nations, iron deficiency may be present in 2O'k to 30% of otherwise healthy women of childbearing age. Menstrual iron Ioss is the most common cause of anemia in this population. Iron deflciency anemia is also a common pregnancy complication because of the heightened iron requirements that occur in the second and third trimestersl it can be further exacerbated by inadequate oral iron intake because of nausea and vomiting. Iron deflciency is typically treated with oral iron salts. Frequent dosing (two or three times daily) of oral iron can lead to increased hepcidin pro- duction, which actually reduces iron absorption (Option C). For this reason, a single daily or every-other-day dose of oral iron sulfate may be the best replacement dose. Gastrointestinal iron loss is a common cause of anemia in adults.

The most appropriate treatment fbr this patient is apixaban (OptionA). The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a safe, effective treatment for most patients with venous thrombo embolism (VTE). The DOACs available fbr use in the United States are dabigatran, rivaroxaban. apixaban, and edoxaban. In clinical trials olpatients with VTE, patients were initially treated with a parenteral agent, usually heparin, and transi tioned to dabigatran or edoxaban. Rivaroxaban and apixaban were studied without concomitant parenteral therapy and are approved as monotherapy for VTE. Dabigatran functions as a direct thrombin inhibitor, whereas the other agents are factor Xa inhibitors. Advantages of DOACs include no need fbr routine monitoring, rapid onset of action and short half life, flxed dosing, and fewer drug drug interactions. These drugs are as effective as warfarin in VTE preventioni although the overall bleeding risk was comparable, less cen tral nervous system bleeding, fatal bleeding, and use ofblood product support among patients taking DOACs was seen than with warfarin. Data from a 2019 systematic review and meta analysis suggest that DOACs may be preferred t<t vitamin K antagonists like warfarin in patients with early stage chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtra tion rate <60 ml/min/1.73 nt2) and atrial flbrillation.

Other sources recommend observation for serum ferritin levels less than 500 ng/ml (500 pg/L) regardless of genotype. This patient has a heterozygous C282Y mutation without elevated iron indices; therefore, without symptoms, no intervention or ongoing surveillance is required. Chelation with agents such as deferasirox is reserved for patients with iron overload who cannot undergo phle botomy because of concomitant anemia (Option A). This patient is not experiencing iron overload, so iron chelation is not necessary.

The patient expresses a preference to be treated at home. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? (A) Apixaban (B) Dabigatran (C) Edoxaban (D) warfarin","Answer: A Ed ucatio na I O bjective : Treat venous thromboembolism with a direct oral anticoagulant. The most appropriate treatment is apixaban (Option A). For patients with uncomplicated deep venous thrombosis (DVT), the American Society of Hematologr (ASH) guideline suggests offering home treatment over hospital treatment. For patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), ASH suggests using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban, over vita- min K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin. However, this recommendation may not apply to certain subgroups of patients, such as those with kidney disease (creatinine clear- ance less than 30 ml/min, except for apixaban), moderate to severe liver disease, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In some of these patients, warfarin will be preferred. Apix aban is a factor Xa inhibitor. It is approved for treatment of WE as monotherapy, without the need for initial parenteral anticoagulation. For an acute VTE, initial dosing is 10 mg twice daily for l week and then 5 mg twice daily thereafter. Rivaroxaban. another factor Xa inhibitor, can also be initi- ated without initial parenteral therapy. Both apixaban and rivaroxaban allow for discharge directly to home with oral therapy. In some instances, the cost of DOACs and the lack of insurance coverage may iead patients who do not otherwise require hospitalization to choose low molecular-weight heparin for the acute home-based management of WE. Dabigatran and edoxaban are also approved for VTE treatment (Options B, C). However, initial therapy with low molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin for at least 5 days is required with both of these agents. Therefore, because initial parenteral treatment is necessary when using dabigatran or edoxaban, these would not be the best choices for this patient. Warfarin is a VI(A that also inhibits proteins C and S (Option D). Warlarin initially lowers protein C levels and may cause a transient increase in coagulability. 'lhere fore, patients initiating warfarin for a newly diagnosed VTE require concomitant initial treatment with parenteral heparin for at least 5 days and until the INR is at least 2 for 24 hours. TCY POIXT o The direct oral anticoagulants apixaban and rivaroxa ban are approved for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism as monotherapy without initial parenteral therapy with heparin.",A

The most appropriate next test is a reticulocyte count and peripheral blood smear (Option C). In assessing patients with anemia, reviewing the complete blood count, mean corpuscular volume, and reticulocyte count along with the peripheral blood smear can provide valuable diag- nostic information. Deflning the anemia as microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic as well as by bone marrow response (elevated versus normal or suppressed reticu locyte production) can narrow the differential diagnosis. The reticulocyte count provides information on the mar row response to anemia. A normal marrow will produce reticulocytes in response to anemia or hypoxia. In the absence of hypoxemia (and by implication, hypoxia), ane- mia associated with an elevated reticulocyte count is most often secondary to bleeding or hemolysis. Hypoprolifer ative anemia is associated with a low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte count; in this situation, the bone marrow is abnormal or lacks substrate for erythrocyte production. The laboratory hallmark of immune mediated hemoly- sis is a positive direct antiglobulin test that detects either IgG or complement (C3) on the ery.throcyte surface (Option B). This test is useful in the diagnosis olautoimmune hemolytic anemia, in which the reticulocyte count will be elevated and the peripheral blood smear will show either sphero cytes (warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or erythrocyte agglutination (cold agglutinin disease). However, the need to obtain a direct antiglobulin test should be informed by an elevated reticulocyte count and/or an abnormal peripheral blood smear. Older age is associated with an increased prevalence of anemia, which can remain unexplained even after a thorough evaluation. Unexplained anemia in older adults is typically hypoproliferative, normochromic anemia. Common identiflable causes of hypoproliferative anemia include vitamin B,r, folate, or iron deficiency or mar row diseases such as myelodysplasia or aplastic anemia (Options A, D, E). These hypoproliferative conditions often have unique flndings on the peripheral blood smear that will help focus the differential diagnosis and additional testing. However, the decision to obtain any ofthese tests should be informed by the reticulocyte count and periph- eral blood smear results. I(EY POIilT .

The most appropriate management is anticoagulation for 6 weeks to treat a superflcial vein thrombosis (SVT) (Option B). SVT often aflects the lower ertremities and is thought to account for 10'1, of lower extremity thromboses. The lesser saphenous vein is a distal superflcial vein. Treatment is indicated for SW when the thrombus is 5 cm or greater in length or is close to the deep venous system or if other thrombophilic risk factors are present. This patient's thrombus length is 7 cm, so anticoagulation for 6 weeks is indicated. An anticoagulant therapy duration of 3 to 6 months is appropriate management of an acute proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that is provoked by reversible risk factors (Option A). SVT. provoked or unprovoked. can be treated with only 6 weeks of anticoagulation. Vein ligation might be considered for patients at higher risk who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagula tion to prevent propagation of the thrombus into the deep venous system (Option C). Vein ligation is not pan of routine care. In this patient, anticoagulation is the preferred therapy. Observation would be an trppropriate management option for a superficial vein thrombosis without high risk features (Option D). Patients with low risk lower extremity SVT can be managed conservatively with warm compresses. analgesics, and NSAIDs. Compression stockings may hasten the resolution of the thrombus. Follow up should be sched uled in I week to ensure symptom resolution. If symptoms persist or worsen, repeat duplex ultrasonography should be performed to evaluate for extension of the thrombus.

Patients requiring chronic transfusions are therefore at risk for developing secondary iron overload. Individuals should be monitored for evidence of iron overload with serial fer ritin level measurements. and MRI should be considered to evaluate iron deposition in the liver or heart. Chelation therapy should begin before end organ injury to the liver or heart is evident. Chelation has been demonstrated to reduce organ iron levels and prolong survival in patients with thal assemia. It is often initiated when the serum ferritin level exceeds 1000 ng/ml (1000 pg/L), alter approximately 15 to 20 units of blood have been transfused, or with evidence of organ deposition (>3 mg of iron per gram dry weight in the liver or cardiac T2. <20 milliseconds on MRI).

The most appropriate diagnostic test to perlorm next is bone marrow biopsy (Option A).

No circulating blasts are present, making a hyper proliferative disorder such as a leukemia or myeloprolif- erate neoplasm (MPN) less likely. Other reversible causes of dysplasia that must be ruled out include vitamin B,r, folate, and copper deflciency; alcohol consumption; med- ications; and infections such as HIV. The best way to fur ther evaluate symptomatic anemia or pancytopenia and to assess this patient's prognosis is to perform a bone marrow biopsy, which will conflrm the histologic diagnosis and provide prognostic information. Testing the ery.thropoietin level is not useful for diag- nostic purposes but can be used after diagnosis to predict response to ery.thropoietin-based therapy (Option B). Eryth- ropoietin deflciency, often associated with chronic kidney disease or acute inflammation, is associated with normo- cytic anemia; leukocyte and platelet counts are typically normal. lAK2 mutation testing would be used to evaluate for suspected polycythemia vera or an associated MPN such as essential thrombocythemia or, more rarely, myelofibrosis (Option C). However, this patient has cytopenias rather than elevated cell counts, no splenomegaly, and no systemic symptoms that would support the presence of an MPN. Tear- drop cells and nucleated erythrocltes would be expected on the blood smear of patients with myeloflbrosis. Parvovirus B19 DNA polymerase chain reaction is not indicated (Option D). Parvovirus B19 is cytotoxic to the erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and can cause pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Parvovirus infection does not usually cause clinically signiflcant anemia in healthy patients. However, patients with chronic hemolysis (such as sickle cell anemia) can have signiflcant anemia with a decreased reticulocyte count. PRCA is not associated with cytopenias in other cell lines or with the appearance of dysplastic cells on the peripheral blood smear as seen in this patient. TTY PQIf,I' .

(A) Apixaban (B) Dabigatran (C) Fondaparinux (D) Low molecular weight heparin","Answer: D Educational Objective: Treat a patient with antiphos- pholipid antibody syndrome. The most appropriate treatment for this patient is initial low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and transitioning Iater to warfarin (Option D). She has systemic lupus erythe- matosus and now has a likely diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS). APLAS is an autoimmune dis- order in which thrombosis and fetal demise (in pregnancy) may occur. Patients with APLAS are at risk for arterial and venous thrombosis. The diagnosis is based on the clinical criteria of thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity and Iaboratory flndings of medium or high-titer antiphospho lipid antibodies present on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. A clue to the presence of the lupus antico- agulant is activated partial thromboplastin time prolonga tion that fails to correct with a mixing study. This patient's diagnosis of APLAS is based on the presence of an acute thrombotic event and positive test results for all three anti phospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardio- lipin antibody, and p2-glycoprotein antibody). This patient's antiphospholipid measurements should be repeated after 12 weeks for flnal conflrmation. Extended anticoagulation is needed now. The risk for recurrent thrombosis is reported to be higher in patients with ""triple-positive"" APLAS serologic tests when treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) compared with LMWH followed by dose-adjusted warfarin. In general, the preferred treatment of acute venous thromboembolism in patients with APLAS is LMWH fol lowed by warfarin. DOACs may be associated with a higher risk of thrombosis compared with warfarin in patients with ""triple-positive"" APLAS or in patients with arterial throm- bosis. Therefore, apixaban and dabigatran would not be the most appropriate choices for this patient (Options A, B). Evidence supporting the use of parenteral anticoag ulants other than LMWH is extremely sparse and consists primarily of a few case reports. Fondaparinux cannot be recommended as an alternative to LMWH until sufficient data can confirm its effectiveness and safety (Option C). Finally, fondaparinux has no reversal agent. Caution should be used in patients at risk for bleeding because the half life is 17 hours.

She has low-risk MDS with 5q-. This subtype of MDS typically has a good prog nosis, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require therapy. However, this patient is experiencing sympto matic anemia requiring frequent transfusions. Lenalid- omide has been shown to effectively decrease transfu- sion requirements in patients with the 5q- cytogenetic abnormality, and more than 50% of patients can become transfusion independent. By eliminating or lowering the transfusion need, lenalidomide indirectly lowers the risk of iron overload and alloimmunization. Lenalido- mide may also delay leukemic transformation, Ieading to improved survival in patients who respond well to treatment. Patients who do not respond to lenalidomide may require salvage therapy with hypomethylating agents such as azacytidine and decitabine. These agents decrease transfusion dependence and the risk of conversion to acute myeloid leukemia. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanta- tion (HSCT) is the only potentially curative option for MDS (Option A). HSCT is performed in patients with higher risk, symptomatic disease. Despite this, trans- plantation is not an option for most patients with MDS because they are older and therefore not candidates for intensive treatment. Lenalidomide is a safer therapy for this patient. Antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine are typi- cally used to treat aplastic anemia in patients younger than 65 years to decrease transfusion requirements (Option B). This older adult patient has MDS with 5q- cytogenetic abnormality, not aplastic anemia.
