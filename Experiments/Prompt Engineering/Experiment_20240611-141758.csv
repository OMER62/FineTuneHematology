0,"A S8-year-old man is evaluated for possible smoldering myeloma. Medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. On physical examination, vital signs and other exam- ination flndings are normal. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoflxation show an IgA protein spike of 3.5 g/dl (35 g/L). Bone mar- row biopsy reveals 50% clonal plasma cells. Whole-body low-dose CT scan is negative for bone lesions. Which of the following is the most appropriate imaging test to perform next? (A) Bone scan (B) Skeletal survey (C) Whole-bodyMRI (D) No further testing","Answer:  C Educational Objective: Evaluate smoldering myeloma with whole-body MRL Whole body MRI is the most appropriate imaging test to perfirrm next in this patient (Option C). Smolderir.rg rrultiple myekrml (MM) is characterized by a serum M pnrtein level ot'3 grdL (:10 gi L) or greater (or >500 n'rg,/24 hr <tf urinary r.nonoclonal lree light chains) or bone nlarrow plasnra clonal cells of lO'X, to 59',1, and no evidence of r.uyekrma related signs or syntptoms. All patients with MM should be assessed tbr skeletal lesions at diagnosis, periodically there:rfler. and when new symptoms occur. Skeletal survey fbllowing a negative low dose CT scan would not provicle any value. Low close CT and PE'l CT scan are recomntencled as the ini tial inraging procedure because of increasecl sensitivity. CT is lrref'erred because of its relatively high sensitivity, speed, ancl patient convenience. If initial imaging with rvhole body krw dose CT is negative, whole body MRI is recontntencled. MRI has been fbund to be more sensitive in iclentilying myeloma related bone lesions and soft tissue lesions fron-r plasnracytoma but is more inconvenient fbr the patient. tf' nrore than one lesion greater than 5 mm is discovered, the patient should be considered to have MM requirir.rg therapy. In this patient with smoldering MM. negative finclings r-rn w,hole body low dose CT scan does not exclude skeletal lesions, and MRI is needed for further evaluation. Although bone scans are useful in detecting bone nletilstases fiom underlying cancer, the bone lesions in MM are otten purely lytic and lack the enhanced osteoblast activ ity that is shown by bone scan imaging. Bonc scans should not be used to assess bone involvement in MM (Option A). In the evaluation of MM, advanced cross sectional imagir.rg with whole-body low dose CT, PET CT scan, or wholc body MRI is preferred to a radiographic skeletal sur vey because advanced cross sectional imaging is signifi cantly nrore sensitive and better able to classify the patient's disease and thereby guide therapy (Option B). 'lhe presence or absence of local skeletal lesions on whole body MRI wiil determine the pl:rn of carc ftrr patients with sntoldering MM. Perfbrming no turther irnrrging places the patient at risk of missing a diagnosis of early MM and appropriate treatment (Option D). r(EY P0t 1{TS .

The most appropriate treatment for this patient is intra venous immune gkrbulir.r (IVIC) (Option C). She has pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) characterized by normocytic ane mia with decreased reticukrcytes and absent or decreased erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and with giant proerythroblasts with intranuclear viral inclusions characteristic of parvovirus Bl9 infection. Several condi tions have beer.r implicatecl in the pathogenesis of PRCA, and chief among thern are parvovirus B19 infection, thy moma, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythemato sus), and lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas. Because of her recent chemotherlpy, she is immunocompromised and vulnerable to viral inlections such as parvovirus Bl9, which she may have been exposed to as a kindergarten teacher. Parvovirus infection in adults may be asymptom :rtic or associated with tever, coryza, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. fbtlowed by a rash. ln adults, the classic ""slapped cheek"" rash may not be apparent but other cuta neous manifestations mily occur.

2,"A S5-year-old woman is evaluated before starting che- motherapy for multiple myeloma. Anticipated therapy will include bortezomib, Ienalidomide, dexamethasone, and daily low-dose aspirin. She has otherwise been well, has no symptoms, and has no previous history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or risk factors for VTE. She takes no medications. Today, her hemoglobin level is 9 g/dl (eo s/L). Inactivated influenza and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines will be administered today. The patient received the herpes zoster virus recombinant vaccine at age 50 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional treatment during chemotherapy? (A) Epoetin (B) Fluconazole (C) Metronidazole (D) Valacyclovir","Answer: E Educational Objective: Evaluate a pregnant patient for pulmonary embolism. No further evaluation is needed (Option E). According to the pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm, this patient has a very low probability of having a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has an elevated D dimer measurement, but D dimer levels progressively increase during the course ofpregnancy, making interpretation difficult. To assist in the diagnosis of PE in pregnant women, diagnostic algorithms have been developed. The YEARS criteria have been shown to reduce the risk ofunnecessary CT angiography in pregnant patients suspected of having a PE. The YEARS algorithm assigns I point each for the presence ofthree cardinal criteria: clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis, hemoptysis, and PE as the most likely diagnosis (point range 0-3). The score is used in conjunction with four potential D-dimer results (<0.5 pg/ml lo.s mg/LJ, >0.s pg/ml [o.s mg/L], <1 pg/ml h mg/LJ, and >1 pg/ml [t mg/LJ). This patient met no YEARS clinical criteria and had a D-dimer measurement less than 1 pg/ml (f mg/L). This corresponds to very low risk for PE, so she should not undergo additional testing or anticoagulation. CT pulmonary angiography can be used in pregnancy to diagnose PE, but it exposes the woman to unnecessary radiation ifthe probability ofPE is low such as in this patient (Option A). A perfusion only scan can be used to rule out PE in a pregnant patient, but only after chest radiography has been performed and the results are interpreted as normal (Option B). This patient has a normal respiratory examination and a low probabiligz of PE, so a perlusion only scan is not needed. Similarly, a ventilation perlusion lung scan is unnecessary when the probability of PE is Iow (Option D). MRI with gadolinium can be used to detect pulmonary emboli, but it is an expensive test and not necessary for this patient with low probability for PE (Option C). Gadolin ium should not be used early in pregnancy because of the uncertainty of the effects on the fetus. MRI with gadolinium may be a diagnostic option in select patients in whom neither CT angiography nor ventilation-perfusion scan can be performed. TEY POIXTS . Pregnancy is associated with elevated D dimer meas- urement. o The pregnancy-adapted YEARS criteria along with D dimer measurement can help determine the risk for pulmonary embolism and avoid unnecessary radi ation exposure.",A
3,"A 42-year-old woman is evaluated for several months of fatigue. She reports a normal diet and no gastrointestinal symptoms. Medical history is notable for hypothyroidism and vitiligo.

(A) Acyclovir (B) Erythropoietin (C) Intravenous immune globulin (D) Prednisone","Answer: D Educational Objective: Prevent herpes zoster virus reactivation during multiple myeloma treatment. In addition to chemotherapy, this patient should receive pro phylactic therapy with valacyclovir to prevent herpes zoster virus reactivation (Option D). She is immunocompromised because of her plasma cell dyscrasia. Treatment guidelines for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) recommend that those treated with proteasome inhibitors (e.g.. bortezomib) should receive antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir, valacyclo vir) to avoid herpes zoster virus reactivation. Prophylaxis should be administered regardless ol previous immuniza tion against herpes zoster virus. This patient should not receive epoetin. an erythro poietin stimulating agent (ESA) (Option A). The American Society of Clinical Oncologz and the American Society of Hematology recommend restricting ESA use to patients with chemotherapy associated symptomatic anemia when cancer treatment is not curative in intent to reduce the need for erythrocyte transfusions. ESAs are not recom mended for patients whose cancer treatment is curative in intent. given the risk of ESA-related cancer progression. Although this recommendation is viewed by some as con troversial, this patient's anemia is asymptomatic and does not require treatment with either an ESA or erythrocyte transfusion. Antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole or levofloxacin is often administered during induction chemotherapy because of the high rate of infection with gram-negative and encapsulated bacteria during the first 3 months of therapy. Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole has been shown to decrease the number of bacterial infections and serious inf'ections. and levofloxacin prophylaxis has been associated with significantly fewer deaths and febrile episodes during this time period. The planned myeloma treatment is not associated with increased risk of fungal infection; therefore. prophylaxis with flu conazole is not indicated in this patient (Option B). Addi- tionally, metronidazole has no activity against encapsulated bacteria, a common source of infection in patients with MM, and is not indicated (Option C). 90  I Answers and Critiques t([Y PO I ]tr o Treatment guidelines for patients with multiple mye- loma recommend that those treated with proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) should receive antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir, valacyclovir) to avoid herpes zoster virus reactivation.",D

Which ofthe following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test? (A) Homocysteine level (B) Methylmalonic acid level (C) Serum folate level (D) Serum vitamin B,, level","Answer: D Educational Objective: Diagnose vitamin B,, deficiency caused by pernicious anemia. The most appropriate diagnostic test fbr this patient is mea suring the serum vitamin 8,, level (Option D). Patients with vitamin B,, deficiency can present with weight loss, glos sitis, and ""lemon yellow"" skin because of pallor and jaun dice resulting from ineffective erythropoiesis. Vitamin B,, deflciency can cause neurologic symptoms, including loss of vibratory sense, loss of proprioception, spastic ataxia, and other dorsal column symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms (megaloblastic mania) can manif'est as dementia, hallucina tions, and lrank psychosis. In patients with vitamin B,, defl ciency, the peripheral blood smear shows oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils. Pancytopenia resulting from ineflective hematopoiesis can also be seen. Other labo ratory flndings are consistent with intramedullary hemolysis caused by ineffective erythropoiesis, including decreased haptoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. The reticulocyte count is low in patients with vitamin B,, deficiency. This patient most likely has vitamin B,, deflciency caused by pernicious ane mia in which autoantibodies to intrinsic factor (lF) prevent the formation of vitamin B,r-lF complexes, resulting in the impaired ability to absorb vitamin B,r. Pernicious anemia can occur as an isolated flnding or with other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo as seen in this patient. An elevated serum homocysteine level has a sensitMty and speciflcity ofgreater than 90'1, in diagnosing folate deflciency and is the preferred test when deficiency is suspected despite a normal serum folate level (Option A). Homocysteine Ievels are also elevated in patients with vitamin 8,, deflcienry, but vitamin B,, measurement is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Serum vitamin B,, is approximately 957, sensitive in the diagnosis of vitamin B,, deficiency in symptomatic patients. Levels greater than 300 pglmL (221pmol/L) effec- tively exclude vitamin B,, deflciency; lower levels may not adequately represent tissue vitamin B,, levels. As such, an elevated concentration of methylmalonic acid is a more sen sitive indicator of vitamin B,, deficiency (Option B). How ever, serum vitamin B,, measurement remains the preferred initial diagnostic test because of its sensitivity. This patient consumes a normal diet and has no gastro intestinal symptoms. Supplemental folate has been added to grains in the United States for many years. As such, dietary folate deflciency is uncommon except in patients with mal nutrition. Folate deflciency has no association with hypothy roidism or vitiligo. Measuring the serum f,olate level would be unnecessary (Option C). KEY POIl{TS . Pernicious anemia, characterized by autoimmune gastritis and intrinsic factor deficiency, is a cause of cobalamin deficiency, which can be evaluated by measuring the serum cobalamin level. r Pemicious anemia can occur as an isolated flnding or with other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo.",C

(A) Chronic myeloid leukemia (B) Occult infection (C) Pravastatin (D) Smoking","Answer: D Educational Objective: Evaluate neutrophilia. Chronic smoking is one of the more common causes of acquired neutrophilia (Option D). How smoking causes an increase in absolute neutrophil count is not entirely clear, but it may be related to inducing an inflammatory process. The degree of neutrophilia appears to be proportional to the amount smoked, and this neutrophilia can persist for a pro longed time even after cessation (for years in some persons). Several other factors can cause an asymptomatic increase in neutrophil count, including asplenia, chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and vigorous exercise. All patients who smoke should be coun seled to stop smoking and should be offered pharmacologic assistance. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may also cause asymptomatic neutrophilia, although patients. not unconl monly, have systemic symptoms or symptoms related to hepatosplenomegaly, which are absent in this patient (Option A). Patients with CML often have increased num bers ol less mature leukocytes, including band tbrms and myelocytes in the peripheral blood. The modest neutrophilia with a normal diflerential, normal peripheral blood smear, and absence of symptoms make smoking or other benign cause a much more likely cause in this patient. Inf'ections are a common cause of leukocytosis. and bacterial infections can cause neutrophilia with a left shitt or presence of'bands, metamyelocytes, or other immature granulocytes in the circulation (Option B). Other findings can include toxic granulations or Dohle bodies seen in circulating neutrophils on review of the peripheral blood smear. In certain severe infections, the leukocyte count can be as high as 1O0,O00/pL (1O0 x fOq/L). Some bacteria are associated with more significant neutrophilia. including clostridial infections. This patient is asymptomatic and has a normal peripheral blood smear, so occult inf'ection is an unlikely cause of his neutrophilia. Some medications can cause an increase in the abso lute neutrophil count. Glucocorticoids cause an increase in release of neutrophils from the bone nrarrort Ml,eloid growth factors (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and lithium are other drugs associated w'ith an increased abso lute neutrophil count.

The most appropriate diagnostic test to perform next is bone marrow biopsy (Option A). This patient has symptom atic macrocytic anemia. She has a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation, both of which are independently associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), so evaluation by bone marrow biopsy will provide key information to confirm the suspicion for therapy- related MDS. Patients who develop MDS often present with macrocytic (and often symptomatic) anemia. Bone marrow biopsy aids in establishing the diagnosis and provides prog nostic information, including assessment of the percentage of marrow blasts and cytogenetics. If therapy related MDS is conflrmed, the patient may be evaluated for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although some experts believe that therapy related MDS is a high-risk con dition independent of cytogenetic abnormalities, obtaining cytogenetic and genetic information may identify a target for novel therapies.

Immune-mediated hemolysis is characterized by antibody binding to erythrocytes causing complement- mediated and phagocy.te mediated destruction. The lab- oratory hallmark of immune-mediated hemolysis is a positive direct antiglobulin test that detects either IgG or complement (C3) on the erythrocyte surface (Option C). Patients with immune-mediated hemolysis may have ane- mia, fatigue, dyspnea, jaundice, splenomegaly, and reticu- loc1.tosis. Pancytopenia would not be an expected flnding. This patient has pancytopenia and a low reticulocyte count, which are not consistent with immune-mediated hemolysis. A low mean corpuscular volume, elevated red cell dis- tribution width, and peripheral blood smear showing micro- cltosis and anisopoikilocytosis are virtually diagnostic of iron deficiency, especially in premenopausal women.

The most appropriate next test is a reticulocyte count and peripheral blood smear (Option C). In assessing patients with anemia, reviewing the complete blood count, mean corpuscular volume, and reticulocyte count along with the peripheral blood smear can provide valuable diag- nostic information. Deflning the anemia as microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic as well as by bone marrow response (elevated versus normal or suppressed reticu locyte production) can narrow the differential diagnosis. The reticulocyte count provides information on the mar row response to anemia. A normal marrow will produce reticulocytes in response to anemia or hypoxia. In the absence of hypoxemia (and by implication, hypoxia), ane- mia associated with an elevated reticulocyte count is most often secondary to bleeding or hemolysis. Hypoprolifer ative anemia is associated with a low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte count; in this situation, the bone marrow is abnormal or lacks substrate for erythrocyte production. The laboratory hallmark of immune mediated hemoly- sis is a positive direct antiglobulin test that detects either IgG or complement (C3) on the ery.throcyte surface (Option B). This test is useful in the diagnosis olautoimmune hemolytic anemia, in which the reticulocyte count will be elevated and the peripheral blood smear will show either sphero cytes (warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or erythrocyte agglutination (cold agglutinin disease). However, the need to obtain a direct antiglobulin test should be informed by an elevated reticulocyte count and/or an abnormal peripheral blood smear. Older age is associated with an increased prevalence of anemia, which can remain unexplained even after a thorough evaluation. Unexplained anemia in older adults is typically hypoproliferative, normochromic anemia. Common identiflable causes of hypoproliferative anemia include vitamin B,r, folate, or iron deficiency or mar row diseases such as myelodysplasia or aplastic anemia (Options A, D, E). These hypoproliferative conditions often have unique flndings on the peripheral blood smear that will help focus the differential diagnosis and additional testing. However, the decision to obtain any ofthese tests should be informed by the reticulocyte count and periph- eral blood smear results. I(EY POIilT .

The most appropriate management is anticoagulation for 6 weeks to treat a superflcial vein thrombosis (SVT) (Option B). SVT often aflects the lower ertremities and is thought to account for 10'1, of lower extremity thromboses. The lesser saphenous vein is a distal superflcial vein. Treatment is indicated for SW when the thrombus is 5 cm or greater in length or is close to the deep venous system or if other thrombophilic risk factors are present. This patient's thrombus length is 7 cm, so anticoagulation for 6 weeks is indicated. An anticoagulant therapy duration of 3 to 6 months is appropriate management of an acute proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that is provoked by reversible risk factors (Option A). SVT. provoked or unprovoked. can be treated with only 6 weeks of anticoagulation. Vein ligation might be considered for patients at higher risk who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagula tion to prevent propagation of the thrombus into the deep venous system (Option C). Vein ligation is not pan of routine care. In this patient, anticoagulation is the preferred therapy. Observation would be an trppropriate management option for a superficial vein thrombosis without high risk features (Option D). Patients with low risk lower extremity SVT can be managed conservatively with warm compresses. analgesics, and NSAIDs. Compression stockings may hasten the resolution of the thrombus. Follow up should be sched uled in I week to ensure symptom resolution. If symptoms persist or worsen, repeat duplex ultrasonography should be performed to evaluate for extension of the thrombus.

Patients requiring chronic transfusions are therefore at risk for developing secondary iron overload. Individuals should be monitored for evidence of iron overload with serial fer ritin level measurements. and MRI should be considered to evaluate iron deposition in the liver or heart. Chelation therapy should begin before end organ injury to the liver or heart is evident. Chelation has been demonstrated to reduce organ iron levels and prolong survival in patients with thal assemia. It is often initiated when the serum ferritin level exceeds 1000 ng/ml (1000 pg/L), alter approximately 15 to 20 units of blood have been transfused, or with evidence of organ deposition (>3 mg of iron per gram dry weight in the liver or cardiac T2. <20 milliseconds on MRI). Regularly scheduled phlebotomy is the accepted care in managing patients with primary hemochromatosis and iron overload but is contraindicated in patients who are transfu sion dependent because of existing anemia (Option B).

Clinical observation and symptom monitoring are appro- priate for this patient (Option E). He is experiencing an acute hemolytic event related to glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deflciency that was likely trig gered by recent medication exposure. G6PD deficiency is an X linked disorder and the most common enzyme deflciency affecting erythrocytes. It is estimated to affect approximately 11% of Black persons in the United States. Enzyme deflciency results in failure to generate nicotin- amide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), leading to reduced glutathione levels and subsequent hemolysis, which is both intra- and extravascular. Acute hemolytic events can be triggered by oxidative stress, with medi- cations and infections among the most common causes.

Semiquantitative tests are used to evaluate enzyme function through reducing NADP to NADPH. However, G6PD levels may appear nor mal during acute hemolytic episodes when brisk reticu- locytosis occurs because reticulocytes have higher G6PD activity than older erythrocytes.",C
19,"A 27-year old woman is diagnosed with acute femoral vein thrombosis. She has systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed 3 months ago. Her only medication is hydroxy chloroquine.

Lupus anti coagulant is positive, and high titer IgG B2 glycoprotein and IgG cardiolipin antibodies are measured. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate treatment? (A) Apixaban (B) Dabigatran (C) Fondaparinux (D) Low molecular weight heparin","Answer: D Educational Objective: Treat a patient with antiphos- pholipid antibody syndrome. The most appropriate treatment for this patient is initial low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and transitioning Iater to warfarin (Option D). She has systemic lupus erythe- matosus and now has a likely diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS). APLAS is an autoimmune dis- order in which thrombosis and fetal demise (in pregnancy) may occur. Patients with APLAS are at risk for arterial and venous thrombosis. The diagnosis is based on the clinical criteria of thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity and Iaboratory flndings of medium or high-titer antiphospho lipid antibodies present on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. A clue to the presence of the lupus antico- agulant is activated partial thromboplastin time prolonga tion that fails to correct with a mixing study. This patient's diagnosis of APLAS is based on the presence of an acute thrombotic event and positive test results for all three anti phospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardio- lipin antibody, and p2-glycoprotein antibody). This patient's antiphospholipid measurements should be repeated after 12 weeks for flnal conflrmation. Extended anticoagulation is needed now. The risk for recurrent thrombosis is reported to be higher in patients with ""triple-positive"" APLAS serologic tests when treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) compared with LMWH followed by dose-adjusted warfarin. In general, the preferred treatment of acute venous thromboembolism in patients with APLAS is LMWH fol lowed by warfarin. DOACs may be associated with a higher risk of thrombosis compared with warfarin in patients with ""triple-positive"" APLAS or in patients with arterial throm- bosis. Therefore, apixaban and dabigatran would not be the most appropriate choices for this patient (Options A, B). Evidence supporting the use of parenteral anticoag ulants other than LMWH is extremely sparse and consists primarily of a few case reports. Fondaparinux cannot be recommended as an alternative to LMWH until sufficient data can confirm its effectiveness and safety (Option C). Finally, fondaparinux has no reversal agent. Caution should be used in patients at risk for bleeding because the half life is 17 hours. TEY POIlIIS o The diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is based on the clinical criteria of thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity and laboratory findings of medium or high-titer antiphospholipid antibodies present on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. o Patients with ""triple-positive"" antiphospholipid anti- body syndrome (presence of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and pr-g$coprotein anti body) should be treated with low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin.

This patient is no longer taking nitrofurantoin, and his hemoglobin level does not necessitate transfusion, so further intervention is not necessary. No evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is seen in this patient's examination, with no reported schisto cltes and a normal platelet count; therefore, a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is not plausible, and plasma exchange would not be necessary (Option B).
