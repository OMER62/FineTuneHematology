0,"A 39-year-old woman is evaluated for anemia. Her  laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL,  hematocrit of 23.9%, mean corpuscular volume of  72 fL, mean cell hemoglobin of 25 pg, and mean cell  hemoglobin concentration of 28%. The peripheral  smear is shown in Figure 2. Which of the follow- ing tests is most likely to be abnormal in this patient?  A. Ferritin B. Haptoglobin C. Hemoglobin electrophoresis D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase E. Vitamin B12","The answer is A.  (Chap. 2) This patient with anemia demonstrates a low  mean cell volume, low mean cell hemoglobin, and  low mean cell hemoglobin concentration. The periph- eral smear demonstrates microcytic and hypochromic  cells, which would be expected given these laboratory  findings. In addition, there is marked variation in size   Review and Self-Assessment 753 (anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis). These find- ings are consistent with severe iron-deficiency anemia,  and serum ferritin would be expected to be <10 to   15 Î¼g/L. A low haptoglobin level would be seen in cases  of hemolysis, which can be intravascular or extravascu- lar in origin. In intravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would be expected to show poikilocytosis with  the presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells  [RBCs]). In extravascular hemolysis, the peripheral  smear would typically shows spherocytes. Hemoglo- bin electrophoresis is used to determine the presence of  abnormal hemoglobin variants. Sickle cell anemia is the  most common form and demonstrates sickled RBCs.  Thalassemias are also common inherited hemoglobinop- athies. The peripheral smear in thalassemia often shows  target cells. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi- ciency leads to oxidant-induced hemolysis with presence  of bite cells or blister cells. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads  to macrocytosis, which is not consistent with this case.","

Answer: A (Ferritin)

Explanation: The given laboratory findings are consistent with microcytic anemia. The microcytic anemia with a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) suggests thalassemia or other causes of microcytic anemia. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant and an iron storage protein. In thalassemia, there is ineffective erythropoiesis due to impaired synthesis of hemoglobin, leading to increased erythropoiesis and increased ferritin levels. Therefore, a high ferritin level is most likely in this patient.","A. Ferritin.

Explanation:
The given laboratory values suggest microcytic anemia, which is characterized by small red blood cells. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is low at 72 fL, and the mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are also low. These findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body, and its levels are typically low in iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, the most likely abnormal test result in this patient is a low ferritin level.

Haptoglobin is a protein that binds free hemoglobin in the blood, and its levels may be low in hemolytic anemias. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to identify abnormal hemoglobin variants, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause hemolytic anemia",1,1
1,"A 62-year-old man is evaluated for anemia. He has a  hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL (normal hemoglobin value,  15 g/dL), hematocrit of 27.0% (normal hemato- crit, 45%), mean cell volume of 88 fL, mean cell  hemoglobin of 28 pg, and mean cell hemoglobin  concentration of 30%. On peripheral blood smear,  polychromatophilic macrocytes are seen. The retic- ulocyte count is 9%. What is the reticulocyte pro- duction index? A. 0.54 B. 1.67 C. 2.7 D. 4.5 E. 5.4","The answer is C.  (Chap. 2) The reticulocyte index and reticulocyte pro- duction index are useful in the evaluation of anemia to  determine the adequacy of bone marrow response to the  anemia. A normal reticulocyte count is 1â€“2%, and in  the presence of anemia, this would be expected to rise  to more than two to three times the normal value (the  reticulocyte index). The reticulocyte index is calculated  as Reticulocyte count Ã— (Patientâ€™s hemoglobin/Normal  hemoglobin). In this case, the reticulocyte index would  be 5.4%. A second correction is further necessary in this  patient given the presence of polychromatophilic mac- rocytes on peripheral smear. This finding indicates pre- mature release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow  (â€œshift cellsâ€_x009d_), and thus these cells have a longer life span.  It is recommended to further divide the reticulocyte  index by a factor of 2, which is known as the reticulo- cyte production index. In this case, the value would be  2.7%.","

Answer: C. 2.7

Explanation:

The reticulocyte production index (RPI) is a measure of the percentage of reticulocytes in the bone marrow relative to the total erythrocyte mass. It is calculated using the following formula:

RPI = (Reticulocyte count x Mean corpuscular volume) / (Hemoglobin x 10)

In this case, the reticulocyte count is 9%, the mean corpuscular volume is 88 fL, the hemoglobin is 9.0 g/dL, and 1 g/dL is equal to 10 g.

So, the calculation would be:

RPI = (9% x 88) / (9.0 x 10)

RPI = 2.7

Therefore, the answer is C. 2.7.","1.67

Explanation:
The reticulocyte production index (RPI) is calculated using the following formula: RPI = (Reticulocyte count × Mean corpuscular volume) / (Hemoglobin × Mean cell hemoglobin concentration)

Given values:
Reticulocyte count = 9%
Mean corpuscular volume = 88 fL
Hemoglobin = 9.0 g/dL
Mean cell hemoglobin concentration = 30%

Substituting these values into the formula:
RPI = (9/100 × 88) / (9.0 × 0.3)
RPI = 1.67

Therefore, the answer is B. 1.67.",1,0
2,"You are asked to review the peripheral blood smear  from a patient with anemia (Figure 4). Serum lac- tate dehydrogenase is elevated, and there is hemo- globinuria. This patient is likely to have which  physical examination finding?  A. Goiter B. Heme-positive stools C. Mechanical second heart sound D. Splenomegaly E. Thickened calvarium","The answer is C. (Chap. 2) This blood smear shows fragmented red blood  cells (RBCs) of varying size and shape. In the presence  of a foreign body within the circulation (prosthetic heart  valve, vascular graft), RBCs can become destroyed.  Such intravascular hemolysis will also cause serum lactate  dehydrogenase to be elevated and hemoglobinuria. In  isolated extravascular hemolysis, there is no hemoglobin  or hemosiderin released into the urine. The characteris- tic peripheral blood smear in splenomegaly is the pres- ence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants within  red blood cells). Certain diseases are associated with  extramedullary hematopoiesis (e.g., chronic hemolytic  anemias), which can be detected by an enlarged spleen,  thickened calvarium, myelofibrosis, or hepatomegaly.  The peripheral blood smear may show teardrop cells  or nucleated RBCs. Hypothyroidism is associated with  macrocytosis, which is not demonstrated here. Chronic  gastrointestinal blood loss will cause microcytosis, not  schistocytes.","

Answer: C. Mechanical second heart sound.

Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests the presence of hemolysis, which is the destruction of red blood cells. The elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and hematuria (hemoglobinuria) are indicative of intravascular hemolysis. A mechanical second heart sound (S2 gallop) may be heard in cases of hemolytic anemia due to increased blood flow through the heart as a result of the increased red blood cell destruction. Goiter, heme-positive stools, splenomegaly, and thickened calvarium are not associated with hemolytic anemia.","D. Splenomegaly.

Explanation:
The given information suggests that the patient has anemia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and hematuria. These findings are suggestive of hemolysis. Splenomegaly is a common physical finding in hemolytic anemias due to the spleen's role in removing damaged red blood cells. Therefore, the most likely physical examination finding for this patient is splenomegaly.

Options A, B, and E are incorrect because goiter, heme-positive stools, and thickened calvarium are not associated with hemolytic anemia.",1,0
3,All of the following are common manifestations of  bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease EXCEPT: A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel B. Epistaxis C. Menorrhagia D. Postpartum hemorrhage E. Spontaneous hemarthrosis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 3) von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inher- ited disorder of platelet adhesion that has several types.  The most common type is inherited in an autosomal  dominant fashion and is associated with low levels of  qualitatively normal von Willebrand factor. As a disorder  primary hemostasis associated with the development of  a platelet plug, VWD is primarily associated with muco- sal bleeding. General bleeding symptoms that are more  common in VWD include prolonged bleeding after  surgery or dental procedures, menorrhagia, postpartum  hemorrhage, and large bruises. However, easy bruising  and menorrhagia are common complaints and are not  specific for VWD in isolation. Factors that raise concern  for VWD in women with menstrual symptoms include  iron-deficiency anemia, need for blood transfusion, pas- sage of clots >1 inch in diameter, and need to change a  pad or tampon more than hourly. Epistaxis is also a very  common occurrence in the general population, but it is  the most common complaint of males with VWD. Con- cerning features of epistaxis that may be more likely to  indicate an underlying bleeding diathesis are lack of sea- sonal variation and bleeding that requires medical atten- tion. Although most gastrointestinal bleeding in indi- viduals with VWD is unrelated to the bleeding diathesis,  VWD types 2 and 3 are associated with angiodysplasia  of the bowel and gastrointestinal bleeding. Spontane- ous hemarthroses or deep muscle hematomas are seen  in clotting factor deficiencies and not seen VWD except  severe VWD with associated decreased factor VIII levels  <5%.","

Answer: A. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel.

Angiodysplasia of the small bowel is a common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in older adults and is not a manifestation of bleeding caused by von Willebrand disease. Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, leading to impaired platelet adhesion and prolonged bleeding time. The common manifestations of bleeding in von Willebrand disease include epistaxis (nosebleeds), menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), and spontaneous hemarthrosis (joint bleeding). Postpartum hemorrhage is a common complication of childbirth and can be caused by various factors, including coagulation disorders.","
C. Menorrhagia

Explanation:
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in primary hemostasis. The common manifestations of bleeding in VWD include:

1. Angiodysplasia of the small bowel: This is a common complication in patients with VWD, especially those with severe forms of the disease. Angiodysplasias are small, abnormal blood vessels that form in the wall of the small intestine and can cause recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Epistaxis: Nosebleeds are a common symptom of VWD, especially in children. The bleeding is usually painless and can be severe, leading to anemia.
3. Postpartum hemorrhage: VWD can increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage due to the increased blood loss during childbirth.
4. Spontaneous hemarthrosis: Joint bleeding is a common manifestation of VWD, particularly in severe forms of the disease.",0,0
4,"A 68-year-old man is admitted to the intensive  care unit with spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed- ing and hypotension. He has a medical history of  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney  disease stage III. His medications include lisinopril,  amlodipine, sitagliptin, and glimepiride. On initial  presentation, he is in pain and has a blood pressure  of 70/40 mm Hg with a heart rate of 132 beats/ min. His hemoglobin on admission is 5.3 g/dL  and hematocrit is 16.0%. His coagulation studies  demonstrate an aPTT of 64 seconds and a PT of  12.1 seconds (INR 1.0). Mixing studies (1:1) are  performed. Immediately, the aPTT decreases to   42 seconds. At 1 hour, the aPTT is 56 seconds, and  at 2 hours, it is 68 seconds. Thrombin time and  reptilase time are normal. Fibrinogen is also nor- mal. What is the most likely cause of the patientâ€™s  coagulopathy? A. Acquired factor VIII deficiency B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Lupus anticoagulant E. Vitamin K deficiency FIGURE 4 FIGURE 2  Review and Self-Assessment 727","The answer is B.  (Chap. 3) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) measures the integrity of the intrinsic and com- mon coagulation pathways, and as such, is affected by  all of the coagulation factors, except factor VII. The  aPTT reagent contains phospholipids derived from ani- mal or vegetable sources and includes an activator of  the intrinsic coagulation system, such as nonparticulate  ellagic acid or kaolin. The phospholipid reagent fre- quently varies from laboratory to laboratory. Thus, an  aPTT measured in one hospital may differ from another.  Isolated elevations in the aPTT can be related to fac- tor deficiencies, heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors,  lupus anticoagulant, or the presence of a specific fac- tor inhibitor. To differentiate between the presence of  factor deficiencies and inhibitors, mixing studies should  be performed. Mixing studies are performed by mixing  normal plasma and the patientâ€™s plasma in a 1:1 ratio.  The aPTT and prothrombin time (PT) are incubated at   Review and Self-Assessment 754 37oC, and levels are measured immediately and serially  thereafter for about 2 hours. If the cause is an isolated  factor deficiency, the aPTT should correct to normal  values and remain normal throughout the incubation  period. In the presence of an acquired inhibitor, the  aPTT may or may not correct immediately, but upon  incubation, the inhibitor becomes more active, and the  aPTT will progressively prolong. In contrast, the aPTT  does not correct immediately or with incubation in the  presence of lupus anticoagulants. The presence of serious  bleeding in the presence of mixing studies suggesting  an inhibitor should further rule out lupus anticoagu- lant as a cause because the lupus anticoagulant typically  presents with no symptoms or as a thrombotic disorder.  The mixing studies do not, however, eliminate the pres- ence of heparin as a cause of the prolonged aPTT. If  heparin were present, the thrombin time, but not the  reptilase time, would be prolonged. In this scenario,  both values were normal, ruling out the presence of  heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor. Likewise, dis- seminated intravascular coagulation can be ruled out  in the presence of normal fibrinogen levels. In serious  vitamin K deficiency, both the PT and aPTT should be   prolonged.","

Answer: B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding, hypotension, and a prolonged aPTT with a decreased aPTT after mixing studies is consistent with an acquired factor VIII inhibitor. The normal thrombin time and reptilase time, along with normal fibrinogen levels, further support this diagnosis. Acquired factor VIII inhibitors can be caused by various conditions, including pregnancy, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders. In this case, the patient's medical history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of other medications, such as lisinopril, which can potentially induce factor VIII inhibitors, make this diagnosis more likely.","
B. Acquired factor VIII inhibitor.

Explanation:
The patient's initial aPTT is prolonged, but mixing studies reveal a normal aPTT when the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma, indicating that the prolonged aPTT is due to a factor in the patient's plasma, not a deficiency in the patient's own clotting factors. The fact that the aPTT decreases over time suggests the presence of an inhibitor, which is most likely an acquired factor VIII inhibitor given the patient's medical history and the fact that factor VIII is the most commonly inhibited coagulation factor.",1,1
5,"A 54-year-old man is seen in the clinic complaining  of painless enlargement of lymph nodes in his neck.  He has not otherwise been ill and denies fevers,  chills, weight loss, and fatigue. His past medical  history is remarkable for pulmonary tuberculosis  that was treated 10 years previously under directly  observed therapy. He currently takes no medica- tions. He is a heterosexual man in a monogamous  relationship for 25 years. He denies illicit drug use.  He has smoked 1Â½ packs of cigarettes daily since  16 years of age. He works as a logger. On physical  examination, the patient is thin but not ill-appear- ing. He is not febrile and has normal vital signs.  He has dental caries noted with gingivitis. In the  right supraclavicular area, there is a hard and fixed  lymph node measuring 2.5 Ã— 2.0 cm in size. Lymph  nodes <1 cm in size are noted in the anterior cervi- cal chain. There is no axillary or inguinal lymph- adenopathy. His liver and spleen are not enlarged.  Which of the following factors in history or physi- cal examination increases the likelihood that the  lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy? A. Age older than 50 years B. Location in the supraclavicular area C. Presence of a lymph node that is hard and fixed D. Size >2.25 cm2 (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) E. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 4) Lymphadenopathy has many causes, including  infections, immunologic diseases, and malignancy among  others. In the vast majority of cases, the cause of enlarged  lymph nodes is a benign process. In the primary care  practice, fewer than 1% of individuals will have malig- nancy, and in individuals referred for lymphadenopathy,  this number rises only to 16%. Some features on history  and physical examination lead to an increased likelihood  that the cause of lymphadenopathy is infectious. Fevers  and chills are more commonly present in benign respira- tory illness but can be present in malignancy. Thus, fever  is a nonspecific symptom. Likewise, generalized versus  focal lymphadenopathy is also not specific. The site of  lymph node enlargement can be important and raise  the risk of malignancy. The presence of supraclavicular  lymphadenopathy is never normal. These lymph nodes  drain the thoracic cavity and retroperitoneal space and   are most commonly enlarged in malignancy. However,  infectious etiologies can also cause supraclavicular lymph- adenopathy. The size and texture of the lymph nodes  also provide important information. Nodes <1.0 cm Ã—  1.0 cm are almost always benign, but lymph nodes >2.0 cm   in maximum diameter or with an area of 2.25 cm2  (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) are more likely to be malignant. Nodes  containing metastatic cancer tend to be described as  hard, fixed, and nontender. In lymphoma, however,  the nodes can be tender because of rapid enlargement  of the node with subsequent stretching of the capsule of   the lymph nodes. Lymphomatous nodes are also fre- quently described as firm, rubbery, and mobile.","

Answer: E. All of the above.

Explanation:

The patient's age, location of the lymph node, and the characteristics of the lymph node itself (hard and fixed) are all factors that increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy. The age of 50 years is a common cutoff for increased risk of malignancy, and the supraclavicular location is more likely to be associated with metastatic disease compared to other locations. The size of the lymph node is also a factor, with larger nodes being more likely to be malignant, although a size of >2.25 cm2 (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) is not mentioned in the scenario, so it is not the only factor. Therefore, the answer is E. All of the above.","
E. All of the above

Explanation:
The patient's age, the location of the lymph node, and the fact that it is hard and fixed are all factors that increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is caused by malignancy. The size of the lymph node is also a significant factor, with a size >2.25 cm2 (1.5 Ã— 1.5 cm) being considered a criterion for referral for further evaluation in some guidelines. Therefore, all of these factors together increase the likelihood that the lymph node enlargement is due to malignancy.",1,1
6,"A 24-year-old woman presents for a routine  checkup and complains only of small masses in her  groin. She states that they have been present for at  least 3 years. She denies fever, malaise, weight loss,  and anorexia. She works as a sailing instructor and  competes in triathlons. On physical examination,  she is noted to have several palpable 1-cm inguinal  lymph nodes that are mobile, nontender, and dis- crete. There is no other lymphadenopathy or focal  findings on examination. What should be the next  step in management? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis C. Excisional biopsy D. Fine-needle aspiration for culture and cytopathology E. Pelvic ultrasonography F. Reassurance","The answer is F.  (Chap. 4) This patientâ€™s lymphadenopathy is benign.  Inguinal nodes smaller than 2 cm are common in the  population at large and need no further workup pro- vided that there is no other evidence of disseminated  infection or tumor and that the nodes have qualities that  do not suggest tumor (not hard or matted). A practi- cal approach would be to measure the nodes or even  photograph them if visible and follow them serially over  time. Occasionally, inguinal lymph nodes can be associ- ated with sexually transmitted diseases. However, these  are usually ipsilateral and tender, and evaluation includes  bimanual examination and appropriate cultures, not nec- essarily pelvic ultrasonography. A total-body CT scan  would be indicated if other pathologic nodes suggestive  of lymphoma or granulomatous disease are present in  other anatomic locations. Bone marrow biopsy would  be indicated only if a diagnosis of lymphoma is made  first.","

Answer: C. Excisional biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of palpable, mobile, and nontender inguinal lymph nodes that have been present for several years is concerning for a benign lymph node, such as a lymph node hamartoma. However, it is important to rule out malignancy, especially given her age. An excisional biopsy is the preferred approach for definitively diagnosing a lymph node lesion and can be curative for benign lesions. A bone marrow biopsy is not indicated in this case, as there are no signs of hematologic malignancy. A CT scan would be more appropriate if there were concerns for metastatic disease or other systemic findings. Fine-needle aspiration may not provide a definitive diagnosis, and pelvic ultrasonography would not be the most appropriate imaging modality for this presentation. Reassurance is not appropriate given the patient's symptoms and findings.","
C. Excisional biopsy

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of palpable, mobile, and discrete inguinal lymph nodes that have been present for at least 3 years is concerning for a benign or malignant lymph node. The next step in management would be to perform an excisional biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis. This will allow for histopathological evaluation and immunophenotyping to determine if the lymph node is benign or malignant, and if malignant, to establish the specific type of lymphoma. Other tests, such as a bone marrow biopsy or CT scan, may be indicated based on the results of the excisional biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration for culture and cytopathology may be insufficient for a definitive diagnosis, and pelvic ultrasonography would not be the most appropriate initial test given the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Reassurance is not appropriate given the concerning findings on physical examination.",0,0
7,All of the following diseases are associated with  massive splenomegaly (spleen extends 8 cm below  the costal margin or weighs >1000 g) EXCEPT: A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension D. Marginal zone lymphoma E. Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 4) Portal hypertension causes splenomegaly via  passive congestion of the spleen. It generally causes only  mild enlargement of the spleen because expanded varices  provide some decompression for elevated portal pres- sures. Myelofibrosis necessitates extramedullary hemato- poiesis in the spleen, liver, and even other sites such as  the peritoneum, leading to massive splenomegaly caused  by myeloid hyperproduction. Autoimmune hemolytic  anemia requires the spleen to dispose of massive amounts  of damaged red blood cells, leading to reticuloendothe- lial hyperplasia and frequently an extremely large spleen.  Chronic myeloid leukemia and other leukemias and  lymphomas can lead to massive splenomegaly caused by  infiltration with an abnormal clone of cells. Marginal  zone lymphoma typically presents with splenomegaly. If  a patient with cirrhosis or right heart failure has mas- sive splenomegaly, a cause other than passive congestion  should be considered.","

Answer: C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension

Explanation: Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by the replacement of normal liver tissue with fibrous and regenerative scar tissue. It is a common cause of splenomegaly due to portal hypertension. However, the other conditions listed are also associated with massive splenomegaly. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the spleen becomes enlarged due to the sequestration of destroyed red blood cells. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the spleen becomes enlarged due to the accumulation of malignant lymphocytes. In marginal zone lymphoma, the spleen becomes enlarged due to the accumulation of malignant B cells. In myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, the spleen becomes enlarged due to the accumulation of bone marrow cells in the spleen.","
C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension

Explanation:
Massive splenomegaly is a common feature in various hematologic and non-hematologic conditions. In the context provided, the diseases associated with massive splenomegaly are:

1. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
2. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
3. Marginal zone lym0phoma
4. Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia

However, cirrhosis with portal hypertension is not typically associated with massive splenomegaly. Cirrhosis can cause splenomegaly, but it is usually not massive unless there is a complication like rupture or infarction. In cirrhosis, the spleen is typically enlarged but does not extend 8 cm below the costal margin or weigh more than 1000 g. Therefore, the answer is C. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension.",1,1
8,"The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bod- ies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood  cells in a patient with hairy cell leukemia before  any treatment intervention implies which of the  following? A. Diffuse splenic infiltration by tumor B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) C. Hemolytic anemia D. Pancytopenia E. Transformation to acute leukemia","The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear  remnants), Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin), baso- philic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) in  the peripheral blood implies that the spleen is not properly  clearing senescent or damaged RBCs from the circula- tion. This usually occurs because of surgical splenectomy  but is also possible when there is diffuse infiltration of  the spleen with malignant cells. Hemolytic anemia can  have various peripheral smear findings depending on the  etiology of the hemolysis. Spherocytes and bite cells are  an example of damaged RBCs that might appear because  of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and oxidative dam- age, respectively. Disseminated intravascular coagulation  is characterized by schistocytes and thrombocytopenia  on smear with an elevated international normalized ratio   Review and Self-Assessment 755 and activated partial thromboplastin time as well. How- ever, in these conditions, damaged RBCs are still cleared  effectively by the spleen. Transformation to acute leuke- mia does not lead to splenic damage.","

Answer: None of the above.

Explanation:

The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells in a patient with hairy cell leukemia does not directly correlate with any of the given conditions. These findings are not specific to hairy cell leukemia and can be observed in various other conditions, including other types of leukemia, anemia, and infections. Therefore, none of the given options is the correct answer.","
B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

Explanation:
The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies, basophilic stippling, and nucleated red blood cells in a patient with hairy cell leukemia before any treatment intervention is indicative of hemolysis, which is a common complication of hairy cell leukemia. Hemolysis can lead to the release of these abnormalities into the circulation, which can be detected in the peripheral blood. However, it is important to note that these findings do not directly indicate the presence of DIC, but rather hemolysis. DIC is a complex condition characterized by the activation of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet dysfunction, which can result in thrombosis and bleeding. While hairy cell leukemia can be associated with DIC, the presence of these abnormalities in the peripheral blood does not necessarily mean that DIC is present. Therefore, the answer is B, but with the qualifier that it implies hemolysis, not necessarily DIC.",0,0
9,Which of the following is true regarding infection  risk after elective splenectomy? A. Patients are at no increased risk of viral infection  after splenectomy. B. Patients should be vaccinated 2 weeks after splenec- tomy. C. Splenectomy patients over the age of 50 are at great- est risk for postsplenectomy sepsis. D. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly impli- cated organism in postsplenectomy sepsis. E. The risk of infection after splenectomy increases  with time.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 4) Splenectomy leads to an increased risk of  overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, an infection  that carries an extremely high mortality rate. The most  commonly implicated organisms are encapsulated. Strep- tococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and sometime  gram-negative enteric organisms are most frequently  isolated. There is no known increased risk for any viral  infections. Vaccination for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae,  and Neisseria meningitidis is indicated for any patient who  may undergo splenectomy. The vaccines should be  given at least 2 weeks before surgery. The highest risk  of sepsis occurs in patients younger than 20 years of age  because the spleen is responsible for first-pass immunity,  and younger patients are more likely to have primary  exposure to implicated organisms. The risk is highest  during the first 3 years after splenectomy and persists at a  lower rate until death.","

Most  individuals present in childhood, and infections com- monly affect the skin, ears, lungs, liver, and bone. Exces- sive inflammatory reaction can lead to suppuration of  lymph nodes, and granulomatous inflammation can be  seen on lymph node biopsy and found in the gastro- intestinal and genitourinary tracts. Aphthous ulcers and  eczematous skin rash can also be seen. The underlying  genetic defect in CGD is the inability of neutrophils and  monocytes to generate the appropriate oxidative burst in  response to infectious organisms. Several mutations can  lead to the disease, and these affect one of the five sub- units of the NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) oxidase enzyme. The test of choice to  diagnose chronic granulomatous disease is the nitroblue  tetrazolium dye test, which demonstrates lack of super- oxide and hydrogen peroxide production in the face of  an appropriate stimulus.","

Answer: C. Giant primary granules in neutrophils.

Explanation:

The patient's history of recurrent abscesses, frequent aphthous ulcers, and eczema are suggestive of a disorder of neutrophil function, specifically neutrophil primary granule deficiency. The presence of axillary and perianal abscesses, as well as a history of a lymph node that ""popped"" and drained spontaneously, suggest recurrent infections. The physical examination findings of eczematous dermatitis, crackles in the left lung base, axillary lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly are consistent with chronic inflammation and infection. The laboratory studies show a high white blood cell count with a predominance of neutrophils, but a low platelet count, which is also consistent with recurrent infections. The finding of granulomatous inflammation on lymph node biopsy suggests chronic infection or inflammation.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immun","
B. Eosinophilia.

Explanation:
The patient's history of recurrent abscesses, lymphadenopathy, and eczema are suggestive of a chronic granulomatous inflammatory process. Eosinophilia is a common finding in patients with chronic granulomatous diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome). The patient's laboratory studies show a high percentage of neutrophils, but eosinophilia is also present, which supports the diagnosis of a granulomatous inflammatory process. Therefore, the most likely test to be found in this patient is eosinophilia.

Therefore, the answer is B. Eosinophilia.",0,0
11,"A 72-year-old man with chronic obstructive pul- monary disease and stable coronary disease presents  to the emergency department with several days of  worsening productive cough, fevers, malaise, and  diffuse muscle aches. A chest radiograph demon- strates a new lobar infiltrate. Laboratory measure- ments reveal a total white blood cell count of 12,100  cells/Î¼L with a neutrophilic predominance of 86%  and 8% band forms. He is diagnosed with commu- nity-acquired pneumonia, and antibiotic treatment  is initiated. Under normal, or â€œnonstress,â€_x009d_ condi- tions, what percentage of the total body neutrophils  are present in the circulation? A. 2% B. 10% C. 25% D. 40% E. 90%","The answer is A.  (Chap. 5) Under normal or nonstress conditions, roughly  90% of the neutrophil pool is in the bone marrow, 2â€“3%  in the circulation, and the remainder in the tissues. The  circulating pool includes the freely flowing cells in the  bloodstream and the others are marginated in close prox- imity to the endothelium. Most of the marginated pool is  in the lung, which has a vascular endothelium surface area.  Margination in the postcapillary venules is mediated by  selectins that cause a low-affinity neutrophilâ€“endothelial  cell interaction that mediates â€œrollingâ€_x009d_ of the neutrophils  along the endothelium. A variety of signals, including  interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor Î±, and other che- mokines, can cause leukocytes to proliferate and leave  the bone marrow and enter the circulation. Neutrophil  integrins mediate the stickiness of neutrophils to endo- thelium and are important for chemokine-induced cell  activation. Infection causes a marked increase in bone  marrow production of neutrophils that marginate and  enter tissue. Acute glucocorticoids increase neutrophil  count by mobilizing cells from the bone marrow and  marginated pool.","

Answer: B. 10%

Explanation: Under normal conditions, approximately 10% of the total body neutrophils are present in the circulation. The remaining 90% are located in various tissues, particularly in the bone marrow, where they function as part of the body's defense against infection. In response to infection or inflammation, neutrophils are mobilized from the bone marrow and released into the circulation, leading to an increase in the percentage of neutrophils in the peripheral blood. In this scenario, the patient has a neutrophilic predominance in his peripheral blood, indicating an infection or inflammatory process, but the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is still within the normal range, suggesting that the neutrophil response has not yet reached its peak. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of neutrophils in the circulation is still around 10% under nonstress conditions.","C. 25%
Explanation: Under normal conditions, approximately 25% to 70% of the total body neutrophils are present in the circulation. The percentage of neutrophils in the circulation can vary depending on the individual's age, inflammatory status, and other factors. However, in this scenario, the patient has a neutrophilic predominance of 86%, indicating that a higher percentage of neutrophils than usual is present in the circulation due to the infection. Therefore, the answer is C. 25% is the approximate percentage of neutrophils in the circulation under normal conditions, but in this case, the patient has an increased percentage of neutrophils due to the infection.",0,0

Which of the  following new drugs would most likely explain this  patientâ€™s neutropenia? A. Darunavir B. Efavirenz C. Ranitidine D. Prednisone E. Trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole","The answer is E.  (Chap. 5) Many drugs can lead to neutropenia, most  commonly via retarding neutrophil production in   the bone marrow. Of the list in the answer choices, tri- methoprimâ€“sulfamethoxazole is the most likely culprit.  Other common causes of drug-induced neutropenia  include alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or  busulfan, antimetabolites including methotrexate and  5-flucytosine, penicillin and sulfonamide antibiotics,  antithyroid drugs, antipsychotics, and anti-inflammatory  agents. Prednisone, when used systemically, often causes  an increase in the circulating neutrophil count because  it leads to demargination of neutrophils and bone mar- row stimulation. Ranitidine, an H2 blocker, is a well- described cause of thrombocytopenia but has not been  implicated in neutropenia. Efavirenz is a nonnucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitor whose main side effects  include a morbilliform rash and central nervous system  effects, including strange dreams and confusion. The  presence of these symptoms does not require drug ces- sation. Darunavir is a new protease inhibitor that is well  tolerated. Common side effects include a maculopapu- lar rash and lipodystrophy, a class effect for all protease  inhibitors.","

Answer: E. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.

Explanation:

The patient's initial neutrophil count was 90%, but it dropped to 5% 2 weeks after starting a new medication, which is a strong indication of drug-induced neutropenia. Among the options, Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole is the most likely culprit. This antibiotic is known to cause neutropenia as a side effect. The other medications listed, such as Darunavir, Efavirenz, Prednisone, and Ranitidine, are less likely to cause neutropenia as a side effect.","
E. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole

Explanation:
The patient's initial WBC count of 3200 cells/Î¼L with 90% neutrophils is consistent with a neutrophilic response to his asthma exacerbation. However, his subsequent WBC count of 900 cells/Î¼L with 5% neutrophils indicates neutropenia. This neutropenia could be due to various causes, including drug-induced neutropenia. Among the drugs mentioned in the scenario, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole is the most likely culprit. Trimethoprim is an antifolate drug that can cause neutropenia as a side effect. The other drugs mentioned, such as darunavir, efavirenz, ranitidine, and prednisone, are less likely to cause neutropenia as a side effect.",1,1
13,All the following are suggestive of iron-deficiency  anemia EXCEPT: A. Koilonychia B. Pica C. Decreased serum ferritin D. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) E. Low reticulocyte response,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 7) Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition con- sisting of anemia and clear evidence of iron deficiency.  It is one of the most prevalent forms of malnutrition.  Globally, 50% of anemia is attributable to iron deficiency  and accounts for approximately 841,000 deaths annu- ally worldwide. Africa and parts of Asia bear 71% of the  global mortality burden; North America represents only  1.4% of the total morbidity and mortality associated with  iron deficiency. Initially, a state of negative iron balance  occurs during which iron stores become slowly depleted.  Serum ferritin may decrease, and the presence of stain- able iron on bone marrow preparation decreases. When   Review and Self-Assessment 756 iron stores are depleted, serum iron begins to fall. Total  iron-binding capacity (TIBC) starts to increase, reflecting  the presence of circulating unbound transferrin. When  the transferrin saturation falls to 15â€“20%, hemoglobin  synthesis is impaired. The peripheral blood smear reveals  the presence of microcytic and hypochromic red blood  cells. Reticulocytes may also become hypochromic.  Reticulocyte numbers are reduced relative to the level  of anemia, reflecting a hypoproduction anemia second- ary to iron deficiency. Clinically, these patients exhibit  the usual signs of anemia, which are fatigue, pallor, and  reduced exercise capacity. Cheilosis and koilonychia are  signs of advanced tissue iron deficiency. Some patients  may experience pica, a desire to ingest certain materials,  such as ice (pagophagia) and clay (geophagia).","

Answer: C. Decreased serum ferritin.

Ferritin is an acute phase reactant protein that stores and regulates iron in the body. In iron-deficiency anemia, serum ferritin levels are typically low due to the depletion of iron stores. Therefore, a decreased serum ferritin level is a diagnostic indicator of iron deficiency, and option C is incorrect.","
C. Decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)

Explanation:
Decreased TIBC is a sign of increased iron saturation and is not a feature of iron-deficiency anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia is characterized by microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and low serum ferritin levels. Koilonychia (spooning of the nails) and pica (abnormal craving and consumption of non-food substances) are common findings in iron-deficiency anemia. A low reticulocyte response is also a feature of iron-deficiency anemia, indicating ineffective erythropoiesis.",0,0
14,A 24-year-old man with a history of poorly treated  chronic ulcerative colitis is found to have ane- mia with a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and a reduced  mean corpuscular volume. His ferritin is 250 Î¼g/L.  Which of the following is the most likely cause of  his anemia? A. Folate deficiency B. Hemoglobinopathy C. Inflammation D. Iron deficiency E. Sideroblastic anemia,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) (See Table 7-4.) The differential diagnosis of  microcytic anemia includes iron deficiency, hemoglo- binopathy (e.g., thalassemia), myelodysplastic syndromes  (including sideroblastic anemia), and chronic inflamma- tion. Inflammation can be distinguished from iron defi- ciency because iron deficiency typically includes a very  low ferritin level (<50 Î¼g/L) and iron binding satura- tion, but in inflammation, they are normal or increased.  Any chronic inflammatory state may cause a hypopro- liferative anemia caused by inadequate marrow utiliza- tion of iron related to hyperproduction of a number of  cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interferon- gamma, and interleukin-1. The anemia of chronic dis- ease may be normocytic/normochromic or microcytic.  Serum iron and iron binding are normal to high in  thalassemia and sideroblastic anemia. Folate deficiency  causes macrocytic anemia.","

Answer: C. Inflammation.

Explanation: The patient's history of chronic ulcerative colitis, low hemoglobin, reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and low ferritin level are all consistent with anemia of inflammation. This type of anemia is commonly seen in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other chronic infections. The low MCV and normal or low reticulocyte count distinguish it from iron deficiency anemia. Folate deficiency typically presents with a macrocytic anemia, and hemoglobinopathies and sideroblastic anemia are characterized by specific morphologic findings on the peripheral blood smear.","D. Iron deficiency.

Explanation:
The patient's low hemoglobin level, reduced mean corpuscular volume, and low ferritin level are all indicative of iron deficiency anemia. Folate deficiency would present with a macrocytic anemia, while hemoglobinopathies would present with abnormal hemoglobin levels. Inflammation can cause anemia, but it would typically present with a normal or elevated mean corpuscular volume. Sideroblastic anemia would present with a microcytic anemia and ringed sideroblasts on peripheral blood smear.",1,0
15,All of the following statements regarding the ane- mia of chronic kidney disease are true EXCEPT: A. The degree of anemia correlates with the stage of  chronic kidney disease. B. Erythropoietin levels are reduced. C. Ferritin is reduced. D. It is typically normocytic and normochromic. E. Reticulocytes are decreased.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 7) Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is  usually associated with a moderate to severe hypoprolif- erative anemia. The level of the anemia correlates with  the stage of CKD. Red blood cells (RBCs) are typically  normocytic and normochromic, and reticulocytes are  decreased. The anemia is primarily caused by a failure  of erythropoietin (EPO) production by the diseased kid- ney and a reduction in RBC survival. Polycystic kidney  disease shows a smaller degree of EPO deficiency for a  given level of renal failure. By contrast, patients with  diabetes or myeloma have more severe EPO deficiency  for a given level of renal failure. Assessment of iron sta- tus provides information to distinguish the anemia of  CKD from other forms of hypoproliferative anemia  and to guide management. Patients with the anemia of  CKD usually present with normal serum iron, total iron- binding capacity, and ferritin levels. However, those  maintained on chronic hemodialysis may develop iron  deficiency from blood loss through the dialysis proce- dure. EPO therapy is effective in correcting the anemia  of CKD. Iron must be replenished in patients with con- comitant iron deficiency to ensure an adequate response  to EPO therapy.","

Answer: D. It is typically normocytic and normochromic.

Explanation: Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a microcytic, hypochromic anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production and iron deficiency. Ferritin levels are typically low due to inflammation and decreased production, while reticulocytes may be increased due to ineffective erythropoiesis.","D. It is typically normocytic and normochromic.

Explanation:
Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD-A) is a type of anemia that occurs in patients with advanced CKD. The anemia is characterized by a decrease in red blood cell (RBC) mass, which leads to a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) levels and an increase in reticulocyte count. The underlying cause of CKD-A is a combination of erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency and impaired iron utilization.

Statement A is true because the degree of anemia does correlate with the stage of chronic kidney disease. As the kidney function declines, the production of EPO decreases, leading to a decrease in RBC production and anemia.

Statement B is true because EPO levels are reduced in CKD-A. EPO is produced in the kidneys, and as kidney function declines, the production of EPO decreases, leading to anemia.

Statement C is true because ferritin, a protein that stores iron, is reduced",0,0
16,All of the following statements regarding the utility  of hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease  are true EXCEPT: A. It is effective in reducing painful crises. B. It produces a chimeric state with partial production  of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow. C. It should be considered in patients with repeated  acute chest syndrome episodes. D. Its mechanism involves increasing production of fetal  hemoglobin. E. The major adverse effect is a reduction in white  blood cell count.,"The answer is B. (Chap. 8, MM Hsieh et al: N Engl J Med 2009;361:2309â€“2317)  The most significant recent advance in the therapy of  sickle cell anemia has been the introduction of hydroxy- urea as a mainstay of therapy for patients with severe  symptoms. Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin and  may exert beneficial effects on red blood cell (RBC)  hydration, vascular wall adherence, and suppression of  the granulocyte and reticulocyte counts. Hemoglobin  F levels increase in most patients within a few months.  Hydroxyurea should be considered in patients experienc- ing repeated episodes of acute chest syndrome or with  more than three crises per year requiring hospitaliza- tion. The utility of this agent for reducing the incidence  of other complications (priapism, retinopathy) is under  evaluation, as are the long-term side effects. Hydroxy- urea offers broad benefits to most patients whose disease  is severe enough to impair their functional status, and it  may improve survival. The main adverse effect is a reduc- tion in white blood cell (WBC) count; dosage should  be titrated to maintain a WBC count at 5000 to 8000/ Î¼L. WBCs and reticulocytes may play a major role in  the pathogenesis of sickle cell crisis, and their suppression  may be an important benefit of hydroxyurea therapy. A  recent study demonstrated that nonmyeloablative bone  marrow transplantation in patients with sickle cell dis- ease could produce a stable chimera that corrected RBC  counts and reversed the sickle cell phenotype.","

Answer: E. The major adverse effect is not a reduction in white blood cell count. Hydroxyurea is an antimetabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis, leading to a decrease in the production of hemoglobin S and an increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. This results in a decrease in the percentage of hemoglobin S, reducing the risk of painful crises, acute chest syndrome, and other sickle cell disease complications. The most common side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and a decrease in white blood cell count, which is usually not clinically significant. However, close monitoring is necessary to detect and manage any potential infections.","
E. The major adverse effect is a reduction in white blood cell count.

Explanation:
Hydroxyurea is a medication used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. It is effective in reducing painful crises, producing a chimeric state with partial production of hemoglobin A by the bone marrow, and should be considered in patients with repeated acute chest syndrome episodes. Its mechanism involves increasing production of fetal hemoglobin. The major adverse effect is not a reduction in white blood cell count, but rather an increase in the risk of infections due to the suppression of bone marrow production of white blood cells.",0,0
17,Which of the following is the most cost-effective  test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin  (vitamin B12) deficiency? A. Red blood cell folate B. Serum cobalamin C. Serum homocysteine D. Serum methylmalonate E. Serum pepsinogen  Review and Self-Assessment 729,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 9) Serum cobalamin is measured by an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay test and is the most cost- effective test to rule out deficiency. Normal serum  levels are typically above 200 ng/L. In patients with  megaloblastic anemia caused by cobalamin deficiency,  the level is usually <100 ng/L. In general, the more  severe the deficiency, the lower the serum cobalamin  level. In patients with spinal cord damage caused by the  deficiency, levels are very low even in the absence of  anemia. Borderline low levels may occur in pregnancy  in patients with megaloblastic anemia caused by folate  deficiency. In patients with cobalamin deficiency suf- ficient to cause anemia or neuropathy, the serum meth- ylmalonate (MMA) level is increased. Serum MMA and  homocysteine levels have been proposed for the early  diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency even in the absence of  hematologic abnormalities or subnormal levels of serum  cobalamin. Serum MMA levels fluctuate, however, in  patients with renal failure. Mildly elevated serum MMA  or homocysteine levels occur in up to 30% of apparently  healthy volunteers and 15% of elderly subjects. These  findings bring into question the exact cutoff points for   Review and Self-Assessment 757 normal MMA and homocysteine levels. It is also unclear  at present whether these mildly increased metabolite lev- els have clinical consequences. Serum homocysteine is  increased in both early cobalamin and folate deficiency  but may also be increased in other conditions (e.g.,  chronic renal disease; alcoholism; smoking; pyridoxine  deficiency; hypothyroidism; and therapy with steroids,  cyclosporine, and other drugs). The red blood cell folate  assay is a test of body folate stores. It is less affected than  the serum assay by recent diet and traces of hemolysis.  Subnormal levels occur in patients with megaloblastic  anemia caused by folate deficiency but also in nearly  two-thirds of patients with severe cobalamin deficiency.  False-normal results may occur if a folate-deficient  patient has received a recent blood transfusion or if a  patient has an increased reticulocyte count. Serum pep- sinogen may be low in patients with pernicious anemia.","

Answer: A. Red blood cell folate

Explanation:

Red blood cell folate is the most cost-effective test for evaluating a patient for suspected cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. This is because folate deficiency can cause similar symptoms as cobalamin deficiency, and measuring red blood cell folate levels can help distinguish between the two. Additionally, measuring red blood cell folate is less expensive than measuring serum cobalamin, homocysteine, or methylmalonate.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Red blood cell folate.","C. Serum homocysteine.

Explanation:
The most cost-effective test to evaluate a patient for suspected cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is serum homocysteine. Homocysteine is an amino acid that is elevated in the blood when there is a deficiency of cobalamin or folate. Measuring homocysteine levels is a sensitive and specific test for detecting cobalamin deficiency, and it is generally less expensive than measuring cobalamin or methylmalonate levels directly. Additionally, measuring homocysteine levels can help distinguish between cobalamin and folate deficiencies, as folate deficiency does not typically cause homocysteine elevation. Therefore, serum homocysteine is the most cost-effective test for evaluating suspected cobalamin deficiency.",0,0
18,A patient being evaluated for anemia has the periph- eral blood smear shown in Figure 20. Which of  the following is the most likely cause of the anemia?  A. Acute lymphocytic leukemia B. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13 C. Cobalamin deficiency D. Epstein-Barr virus infection E. Iron deficiency,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 9) The peripheral blood smear shows hypochro- masia, macrocytosis, and a hypersegmented (>five lobes)  neutrophil. These findings are typical for a megaloblastic  anemia as seen in cobalamin or folate deficiency. The  mean corpuscular volume is typically >100 fL, and there  is significant anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. There may  also be leukopenia and thrombocytopenia that corre- late with the degree of deficiency. Other less common  causes of megaloblastic anemia include therapy with  drugs that interfere with folate metabolism (methotrex- ate) or DNA synthesis (hydroxyurea, AZT, cytosine  arabinoside, 6-mercaptopurine) and some cases of acute  myeloblastic leukemia or myelodysplasia. Autoantibod- ies to ADAMTS-13 are associated with thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura, which causes a microangio- pathic hemolytic anemia. Epstein-Barr virus infection is  associated with large atypical lymphocytes, not hyper- segmented neutrophils. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  microcytic hypochromic anemia.","

Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine the cause of the anemia based on the given peripheral blood smear alone. However, the presence of spherocytes and reticulocytosis suggests that the anemia may be hemolytic in nature. Therefore, options A, B, and D should be considered. The absence of schistocytes and burr cells argues against microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (option A), and the absence of reticulocytosis >2% would argue against autoimmune hemolytic anemia (option B). Therefore, the most likely cause of the anemia based on the given information is option D, cobalamin deficiency. However, it is important to note that other causes of hemolytic anemia, such as infections, drugs, and other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, should also be considered. A definitive diagnosis would require further evaluation, including a complete blood count, reticulocyte count, haptoglobin level, direct and indirect Coombs tests, and possibly a bone marrow biopsy.","E. Iron deficiency

Explanation:
The peripheral blood smear in Figure 20 shows microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells, which is indicative of iron deficiency anemia. The other options are less likely based on the information provided. Acute lymphocytic leukemia would typically present with blast cells on the peripheral blood smear, autoantibodies to ADAMTS-13 would cause a consumptive coagulopathy, cobalamin deficiency would present with macrocytic red blood cells, and Epstein-Barr virus infection would not typically cause microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells.",0,0
19,Patients from which of the following regions need  not be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydro- genase (G6PD) deficiency when starting a drug that  carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis? A. Brazil B. Russia C. Southeast Asia D. Southern Europe E. Sub-Saharan Africa F. None of the above,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) Red blood cells (RBCs) use glutathione  produced by the hexose monophosphate shunt to com- pensate for increased production of reactive oxygen spe- cies (oxidant stress), usually induced by drugs or toxins.  Defects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)  are the most common congenital hexose monophos- phate shunt defect. If the RBC is unable to maintain  an adequate level of glutathione during oxidant stress,  hemoglobin precipitates in the RBC, producing Heinz  bodies. Because the G6PD gene is on the X chromo- some, almost all affected patients are males. G6PD defi- ciency is widely distributed throughout regions that are  currently or were once highly malarial endemic. It is  common in males of African, African American, Sardin- ian, and Sephardic descent. In most persons with G6PD  deficiency, there is no evidence of symptomatic disease.  However, infection, ingestion of fava beans, or exposure  to an oxidative agent (drug or toxin) can trigger an acute  hemolytic event. Bite cells, Heinz bodies, and bizarre  poikilocytes may be evident on smear. The drugs that  most commonly precipitate a G6PD crisis include dap- sone, sulfamethoxazole, primaquine, and nitrofurantoin.  The anemia is often severe with rapid onset after drug  ingestion, and renal failure can occur.","

Answer: C. Southeast Asia

Explanation:
G6PD deficiency is most common in populations from Africa, the Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia. However, Southeast Asians are less likely to have the most common G6PD variant (G6PD deficiency-A) that is associated with hemolysis when exposed to oxidative drugs like primaquine and 8-aminoquinolines. Therefore, screening for G6PD deficiency is not routinely recommended for Southeast Asian populations when starting these drugs.","
E. None of the above

Explanation:
The context information does not provide any details about the regions where patients do not need to be screened for G6PD deficiency when starting a drug that carries a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis. Therefore, the answer is ""None of the above"" as there is no definitive answer based on the context information provided.

However, it is important to note that G6PD deficiency is common in certain populations, including individuals from Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central and South America, and Africa. Therefore, it is generally recommended to screen individuals from these regions for G6PD deficiency before administering drugs that carry a risk for G6PD-mediated hemolysis.

On initial evalua- tion, she is tachycardic and hypotensive, appears  pale, is dyspneic, and is somewhat difficult to  arouse. Physical examination reveals splenomegaly.  Her initial hemoglobin is 6 g/dL, white blood cell  count is 6300/Î¼L, and platelets are 294,000/Î¼L.  Her total bilirubin is 4 g/dL, reticulocyte count  is 18%, and haptoglobin is not detectable. Renal  function is normal, as is urinalysis. What would you  expect on her peripheral blood smear? A. Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes  with hypersegmented nuclei B. Microspherocytes C. Schistocytes D. Sickle cells E. Target cells","The answer is B.  (Chap. 10) This patientâ€™s lupus and her rapid develop- ment of truly life-threatening hemolytic anemia are  both very suggestive of autoimmune hemolytic ane- mia. Diagnosis is made by a positive Coombs test result  documenting antibodies to the red cell membrane, but  smear will often show microspherocytes, indicative of  the damage incurred to the red cells in the spleen. Schis- tocytes are typical for microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mias such as hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura. The lack of thrombocyto- penia makes these diagnoses considerably less plausible.  Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes with  hypersegmented nuclei are very suggestive of vitamin  B12 deficiency, which causes more chronic, nonâ€“life- threatening anemia. Target cells are seen in liver disease  and thalassemias. Sickle cell anemia is associated with  aplastic crises, but this patient has no known diagnosis of  sickle cell disease and is showing evidence of erythropoi- etin response based on the presence of elevated reticu- locyte count.","

Answer: C. Schistocytes.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and ethnicity are consistent with hemolytic anemia secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus. The reticulocyte count is elevated, indicating ongoing hemolysis. The absence of haptoglobin and the presence of a negative Coombs test would support the diagnosis of intravascular hemolysis. Schistocytes, or ""schistocytes,"" are fragmented red blood cells that result from mechanical hemolysis, such as that which occurs in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Therefore, the most likely finding on the peripheral blood smear would be schistocytes. Macrocytosis and polymorphonuclear leukocytes with hypersegmented nuclei (option A) would be more consistent with a megaloblastic anemia, such as that caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Microspherocytes (option B) are small, spherical red blood cells with a decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV)","
C. Schistocytes.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and physical examination suggest hemolysis, which is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Schistocytes, also known as ""schizocytes,"" are fragmented red blood cells that result from mechanical damage to red blood cells, such as that caused by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

Her peripheral smear  is shown in Figure 23. Her physical examination  is notable for splenomegaly and a normal 3-month  uterus. What is the most likely diagnosis?  A. Colonic polyp B. G6PD deficiency C. Hereditary spherocytosis D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","The answer is C.  (Chap. 10) The peripheral blood smear shows micro- spherocytes, small densely staining red blood cells  (RBCs) that have lost their central pallor characteris- tic of hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytosis is almost  the only condition with an increased mean corpuscular  hemoglobin concentration. Hereditary spherocytosis is a  heterogeneous RBC membranopathy that can be either  congenital (usually autosomal dominant) or acquired; it  is characterized by predominantly extravascular hemo- lysis in the spleen caused by defects in membrane struc- tural proteins. This spleen-mediated hemolysis leads to  the conversion of classic biconcave RBCs on smear to  spherocytes. Splenomegaly is common. This disorder  can be severe, depending on the site of mutation, but  is often overlooked until some stressor such as preg- nancy leads to a multifactorial anemia, or an infection  such as parvovirus B19 transiently eliminates RBC pro- duction altogether. Acute treatment is with transfusion.  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency  is a cause of hemolysis that is usually triggered by the  presence of an offending oxidative agent. The peripheral  blood smear may show Heinz bodies. Parvovirus infec- tion may cause a pure RBC aplasia. The presence of  active reticulocytosis and laboratory findings consistent   Review and Self-Assessment 758 with hemolysis are not compatible with that diagnosis.  Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, such as caused by a  colonic polyp, would cause a microcytic, hypochromic  anemia without evidence of hemolysis (indirect biliru- bin, haptoglobin abnormalities).","

Answer: D. Parvovirus B19 infection.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and physical examination are consistent with hemolytic anemia of pregnancy caused by Parvovirus B19 infection. The reticulocytosis, elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and undetectable haptoglobin are characteristic of this condition. The peripheral smear may show anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and the presence of nucleated red blood cells, which are also common findings in Parvovirus B19 infection. The other options are not consistent with the given information.","D. Parvovirus B19 infection.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and physical examination suggest hemolytic anemia. The elevated reticulocyte count and indirect bilirubin, along with the undetectable haptoglobin, are indicative of hemolysis. The peripheral smear shows evidence of microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells, which is consistent with hemolytic anemia. The splenomegaly is a common finding in Parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of hemolytic anemia in pregnant women.

22,"The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis,  and pancytopenia suggests which of the following   diagnoses? A. Acute promyelocytic leukemia B. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) C. Leptospirosis D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) FIGURE 23 FIGURE 20  Review and Self-Assessment 730","The answer is D. (Chap. 10) Each of the listed diagnoses has a rather char- acteristic set of laboratory findings that are virtually diag- nostic for the disease once the disease has progressed to a  severe stage. The combination of portal vein thrombo- sis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is typical for paroxysmal  nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare disor- der characterized by hemolytic anemia (particularly at  night), venous thrombosis, and deficient hematopoiesis.  It is a stem cellâ€“derived intracorpuscular defect. Ane- mia is usually moderate in severity, and there is often  concomitant granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.  Venous thrombosis occurs much more commonly than  in the population at large. The intraabdominal veins are  often involved, and patients may present with Budd- Chiari syndrome. Cerebral sinus thrombosis is a com- mon cause of death in patients with PNH. The presence  of pancytopenia and hemolysis should raise suspicion for  this diagnosis even before the development of a venous  thrombosis. In the past, PNH was diagnosed by abnor- malities on the Ham or sucrose lysis test; however, cur- rently flow cytometry analysis of glycosylphosphati- dylinositol (GPI) linked proteins (e.g., CD55 and CD59)  on red blood cells and granulocytes is recommended.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic  thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) both cause hemolysis  and thrombocytopenia, as well as fevers. Cerebrovascu- lar events and mental status change occur more com- monly in TTP, and renal failure is more common in  HUS. Severe leptospirosis, or Weilâ€™s disease, is notable  for fevers, hyperbilirubinemia, and renal failure. Con- junctival suffusion is another helpful clue. Acute promy- elocytic leukemia is notable for anemia, thrombocytope- nia, and either elevated or a decreased white blood cell  count, all in the presence of disseminated intravascular  coagulation.","

Answer: E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

Explanation: The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is a classic presentation of thrombotic microangiopathy, which includes TTP and HUS. However, in TTP, there is no diarrhea or renal failure, which distinguishes it from HUS. PNH is characterized by hemolysis, reticulocytosis, and a positive Ham test, which is not present in this case. Acute promyelocytic leukemia and leptospirosis do not present with this triad.","D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)

Explanation:
The triad of portal vein thrombosis, hemolysis, and pancytopenia is a characteristic finding in Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare, acquired, and life-threatening disorder characterized by the absence or deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins on the surface of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. This deficiency leads to hemolysis, thrombosis, and pancytopenia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the presence of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) fusion protein, which leads to coagulopathy, hemorrhage, and pancytopenia. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, throm",0,1
23,All of the following laboratory values are consistent  with an intravascular hemolytic anemia EXCEPT: A. Increased haptoglobin B. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) C. Increased reticulocyte count D. Increased unconjugated bilirubin E. Increased urine hemosiderin,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 10) Haptoglobin is an Î±-globulin normally pres- ent in serum. It binds specifically to the globin portion of  hemoglobin, and the complex is cleared by the mono- nuclear cell phagocytosis. Haptoglobin is reduced in all  hemolytic anemias because it binds free hemoglobin. It  can also be reduced in cirrhosis and so is not diagnostic of  hemolysis outside of the correct clinical context. Assum- ing normal bone marrow and iron stores, the reticulo- cyte count will be elevated as well to try to compensate  for the increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction of  hemolysis. Release of intracellular contents from the  RBC (including hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase)  induces heme metabolism, producing unconjugated bili- rubinemia. If the haptoglobin system is overwhelmed,  the kidney will filter free hemoglobin and reabsorb it in  the proximal tubule for storage of iron by ferritin and  hemosiderin. Hemosiderin in the urine is a marker of fil- tered hemoglobin by the kidneys. In massive hemolysis,  free hemoglobin may be excreted in urine.","

Answer: E. Increased urine hemosiderin

Explanation:

Intravascular hemolysis is the destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) within the circulatory system. The following laboratory findings are commonly seen in intravascular hemolysis:

1. Increased reticulocyte count: Reticulocytes are immature RBCs that contain large amounts of RNA. They are released from the bone marrow in response to increased demand for new RBCs due to hemolysis.
2. Increased LDH: LDH is an enzyme that is released from damaged cells, including RBCs. Its levels are elevated in intravascular hemolysis.
3. Increased unconjugated bilirubin: Bilirubin is a pigment that is produced when hemoglobin is broken down. It is normally conjugated in the liver and excreted in the bile. In intravascular hemolysis, unconjugated bilirubin can leak into the circulation and cause jaundice.
4. Decreased haptoglobin","
A. Increased haptoglobin

Explanation:
Intravascular hemolysis is characterized by the rupture of red blood cells (RBCs) within the circulation, leading to the release of hemoglobin (Hb) and other components into the plasma. Haptoglobin is a plasma protein that binds free Hb, preventing its oxidation and clearance by the kidneys. In intravascular hemolysis, haptoglobin levels decrease due to the binding of Hb, making it an inconsistent finding in this scenario. The other options, increased LDH, reticulocyte count, unconjugated bilirubin, and urine hemosiderin, are consistent with intravascular hemolysis. LDH is an enzyme released during hemolysis, reticulocytes are immature RBCs produced in response to hemolysis, unconjugated bilirubin is a byproduct of hemoglobin breakdown, and hemosiderin is a form of iron that accumulates in tissues as a result of chronic hemolysis.",0,1
24,Which of the following hemolytic anemias can be  classified as extracorpuscular? A. Elliptocytosis B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria C. Pyruvate kinase deficiency D. Sickle cell anemia E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 10) Hemolytic anemias may be classified as intra- corpuscular or extracorpuscular. In intracorpuscular  disorders, the patientâ€™s red blood cells (RBCs) have an  abnormally short life span because of an intrinsic RBC  factor. In extracorpuscular disorders, the RBC has a  short life span because of a nonintrinsic RBC factor.  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an  acquired disorder in which red blood cell and platelet  destruction occur not because of defects of these cell  lines but rather as a result of microangiopathy leading  to destructive shear forces on the cells. Other clinical  signs and symptoms include fever; mental status change;  and, less commonly, renal impairment. Most acquired  adult cases of TTP are associated with autoantibodies to  ADAMTS-13 (or von Willebrand factorâ€“cleaving pro- tease). All cases of hemolysis in conjunction with throm- bocytopenia should be rapidly ruled out for TTP by  evaluation of a peripheral smear for schistocytes because  plasmapheresis is lifesaving. Other causes of extravascular  hemolytic anemia include hypersplenism, autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagula- tion, and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias.  The other four disorders listed in the question all refer  to some defect of the RBC itself that leads to hemo- lysis. Elliptocytosis is a membranopathy that leads to   varying degrees of destruction of the RBC in the reticu- loendothelial system. Sickle cell anemia is a congenital  hemoglobinopathy classified by recurrent pain crises and  numerous long-term sequelae that is caused by a well- defined Î²-globin mutation. Pyruvate kinase deficiency  is a rare disorder of the glycolytic pathway that causes  hemolytic anemia. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin- uria (PNH) is a form of acquired hemolysis caused by an  intrinsic abnormality of the RBCs. It also often causes  thrombosis and cytopenias. Bone marrow failure is a  feared association with PNH.","

Answer: E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Explanation:
Extracorpuscular hemolytic anemias are characterized by the formation of antibody-coated red blood cells (RBCs) outside the RBC membrane, leading to their destruction in the spleen or other organs. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a classic example of an extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia. In TTP, the underlying cause is a deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13, which results in the formation of microangiopathic thrombosis and the release of microparticles containing RBC fragments and platelet membranes. These microparticles can then activate the complement system and initiate the formation of antibodies against RBCs, leading to their destruction in the spleen and other organs.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

The other options are not extracorpus","E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

Explanation:
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia characterized by the formation of microthrombi in small blood vessels, leading to hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction. The other options listed are intracorpuscular hemolytic anemias, where the hemolysis occurs within the red blood cells themselves.",1,1

(Chap. 11) Pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA) is a con- dition characterized by the absence of reticulocytes and  erythroid precursors. A variety of conditions may cause  PRCA. It may be idiopathic. It may be associated with  certain medications, such as trimethoprimâ€“sulfamethox- azole (TMP-SMX) and phenytoin. It can be associated  with a variety of neoplasms, either as a precursor to a  hematologic malignancy such as leukemia or myelo- dysplasia or as part of an autoimmune phenomenon,   Review and Self-Assessment 759 as in the case of thymoma. Infections also may cause  PRCA. Parvovirus B19 is a single-strand DNA virus that  is associated with erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease  in children. It is also associated with arthropathy and a  flulike illness in adults. It is thought to attack the P anti- gen on proerythroblasts directly. Patients with a chronic  hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell disease, or with an  immunodeficiency are less able to tolerate a transient  drop in reticulocytes because their red blood cells do not  survive in the peripheral blood for an adequate period.  In this patient, her daughter had an illness before the  appearance of her symptoms. It is reasonable to check  her parvovirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers. If the  results are positive, a dose of intravenous Ig is indicated.  Because her laboratory test results and smear are not  suggestive of dramatic sickling, an exchange transfusion  is not indicated. Immunosuppression with prednisone,  cyclosporine, or both may be indicated if another etiol- ogy of the PRCA is identified. However, that would  not be the next step. Similarly, a bone marrow trans- plant might be a consideration in a young patient with  myelodysplasia or leukemia, but there is no evidence of  that at this time. Antibiotics have no role in light of her  normal white blood cell count and the lack of evidence  for a bacterial infection.","

Answer: C. Check parvovirus titers.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and bone marrow biopsy results are consistent with aplastic crisis due to parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of aplastic crisis in patients with sickle cell anemia. The absence of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow despite a low hemoglobin level is a key finding in this scenario. Parvovirus B19 infection can lead to a transient aplastic crisis, which can be self-limiting in some cases but may require blood transfusions in severe cases. The most appropriate next management step is to check parvovirus titers to confirm the diagnosis and monitor the infection. If the diagnosis is confirmed, supportive care, such as blood transfusions, may be necessary. There is no role for exchange transfusion, bone marrow transplant, prednisone, or cyclosporine in the management of parvovirus B19 infection in this scenario. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are not indicated as there is","
C. Check parvovirus titers.

26,Aplastic anemia has been associated with all of the  following EXCEPT: A. Carbamazepine therapy B. Methimazole therapy C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs D. Parvovirus B19 infection E. Seronegative hepatitis,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) Aplastic anemia is defined as pancytopenia  with bone marrow hypocellularity. Aplastic anemia  may be acquired, iatrogenic (chemotherapy), or genetic  (e.g., Fanconiâ€™s anemia). Acquired aplastic anemia may  be caused by drugs or chemicals (expected toxicity or  idiosyncratic effects), viral infections, immune diseases,   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, pregnancy, or  idiopathic causes. Aplastic anemia from idiosyncratic  drug reactions (including those listed as well others,  including as quinacrine, phenytoin, sulfonamides, or  cimetidine) are uncommon but may be encountered  given the wide usage of some of these agents. In these  cases, there is usually not a dose-dependent response;  the reaction is idiosyncratic. Seronegative hepatitis is a  cause of aplastic anemia, particularly in young men who  recovered from an episode of liver inflammation 1 to  2 months earlier.

Red blood cell and platelet transfusion","The answer is D.  (Chap. 11) This patient has aplastic anemia. In the absence  of drugs or toxins that cause bone marrow suppression,  it is most likely that he has an immune-mediated injury.  Growth factors are not effective in the setting of hypoplas- tic bone marrow. Transfusion should be avoided unless  emergently needed to prevent the development of allo- antibodies. Glucocorticoids have no efficacy in aplastic  anemia. Immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin  and cyclosporine is a therapy with proven efficacy for this  autoimmune disease with a response rate of up to 70%.  Relapses are common, and myelodysplastic syndrome  or leukemia may occur in approximately 15% of treated  patients. Immunosuppression is the treatment of choice  for patients without suitable bone marrow transplant  donors. Bone marrow transplantation is the best current  therapy for young patients with matched sibling donors.  Allogeneic bone marrow transplants from matched sib- lings result in long-term survival in more than 80% of  patients, with better results in children than adults. The  effectiveness of androgens has not been verified in con- trolled trials, but occasional patients will respond or even  demonstrate blood count dependence on continued ther- apy.

For patients with moderate disease  or those with severe pancytopenia in whom immunosup- pression has failed, a 3 to 4-month trial is appropriate.","

Answer: E. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of diffuse bruising, pancytopenia, and hypocellular bone marrow with normal chromosome studies is consistent with aplastic anemia. The best treatment for severe aplastic anemia is hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a fully histocompatible donor. Antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine are used for the treatment of aplastic anemia, but they are not the best option for this patient due to the availability of a fully histocompatible donor. Glucocorticoids may be used as an initial treatment, but they are not curative and may not be effective in severe cases. Growth factors may be used to support neutrophil and platelet counts during treatment, but they do not address the underlying cause of the pancytopenia. Red blood cell and platelet transfusions may be necessary to support the patient during treatment, but they do not address the underlying cause of the pancytopenia either.","E.

His median survival is >12 months. D. Lenalidomide is effective in reversing the anemia. E. Only stem cell transplantation offers a cure.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 11) Myelodysplasia, or the MDSs, are a hetero- geneous group of hematologic disorders broadly charac- terized by cytopenias associated with a dysmorphic (or  abnormal appearing) and usually cellular bone marrow  and by consequent ineffective blood cell production.  The mean onset of age is after 70 years. MDS is associ- ated with environmental exposures such as radiation and  benzene; other risk factors have been reported inconsis- tently. Secondary MDS occurs as a late toxicity of can- cer treatment, usually with a combination of radiation  and the radiomimetic alkylating agents such as busul- fan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period  of 5â€“7 years) or the DNA topoisomerase inhibitors   (2 years). Both acquired aplastic anemia after immuno- suppressive treatment and Fanconiâ€™s anemia can evolve  into MDS. MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell dis- order leading to impaired cell proliferation and differen- tiation. Cytogenetic abnormalities are found in approxi- mately half of patients, and some of the same specific  lesions are also seen in frank leukemia. Anemia dominates  the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain  of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea,  and pallor, but at least half of patients are asymptomatic,  and their MDS is discovered only incidentally on routine  blood counts. Previous chemotherapy or radiation expo- sure is an important historic fact. Fever and weight loss  should point to a myeloproliferative rather than myelo- dysplastic process. About 20% of patients have spleno- megaly. Bone marrow is typically hypercellular. Median  survival varies from months to years, depending on the  number of blasts in marrow and the specific cytogenetic  abnormality. Isolated 5q- is associated with a median  survival in years. Most patients die as a result of com- plications of pancytopenia and not because of leukemic    Review and Self-Assessment 760 transformation; perhaps one-third succumb to other dis- eases unrelated to their MDS. Precipitous worsening of  pancytopenia, acquisition of new chromosomal abnor- malities on serial cytogenetic determination, increase in  the number of blasts, and marrow fibrosis are all poor  prognostic indicators. The outlook in therapy-related  MDS, regardless of type, is extremely poor, and most  patients progress within a few months to refractory acute  myeloid leukemia. Historically, the therapy of MDS has  been unsatisfactory. Only stem cell transplantation offers  cure. Survival rates of 50% at 3 years have been reported,  but older patients are particularly prone to develop treat- ment-related mortality and morbidity. Results of trans- plant using matched unrelated donors are comparable,  although most series contain younger and more highly  selected cases. However, multiple new drugs have been  approved for use in MDS. Several regimens appear to  not only improve blood counts but also to delay onset of  leukemia and to improve survival.  Lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative with a more  favorable toxicity profile, is particularly effective in  reversing anemia in MDS patients with 5q- syndrome;  a high proportion of these patients become transfusion  independent.","

Answer: B. He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, pallor, and laboratory findings of anemia, thrombocytosis, and a low normal white blood cell count with a hypercellular bone marrow and 5q-cytogenetic abnormality are consistent with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), specifically 5q-syndrome. The median survival for this subtype of MDS is around 10-12 years, and the risk of leukemic transformation is approximately 15-30%. However, the risk of leukemic transformation is not the most likely cause of death in this patient at this time. The primary causes of death in MDS are usually related to the anemia, infection, or bleeding complications. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

Lenalidomide, a Rev-ERB-Î± inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in reversing anemia in some patients with MDS, particularly those with low-risk disease. Therefore, statement D is correct.
","
B. He is most likely to die as a result of leukemic transformation.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings and bone marrow examination are consistent with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), specifically 5q- syndrome. MDS is a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of leukemic transformation. However, the risk of leukemic transformation is not high in this patient's case, as he has a low percentage of blasts in his bone marrow. The median survival for patients with 5q- syndrome is around 12 months, but it can vary depending on the patient's age, cytogenetic risk group, and other factors. Lenalidomide, a drug used in the treatment of MDS, can help improve anemia and reduce the risk of leukemic transformation. Stem cell transplantation is a curative option for some patients with MDS, but it is not the only treatment and is not always necessary.",1,1
29,All of the following are considered myeloprolif- erative disorders in the WHO classification system  EXCEPT: A. Chronic myeloid leukemia (bcr-abl positive) B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Mastocytosis D. Polycythemia vera E. Primary effusion lymphoma  Review and Self-Assessment 731,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) The World Health Organizationâ€™s classifica- tion of the chronic myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs)  includes eight disorders, some of which are rare or  poorly characterized but all of which share an origin in a  multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell, overproduc- tion of one or more of the formed elements of the blood  without significant dysplasia, a predilection to extramed- ullary hematopoiesis or myelofibrosis, and transforma- tion at varying rates to acute leukemia. Within this broad  classification, however, significant phenotypic hetero- geneity exists. Some diseases such as chronic myeloid  leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL),  and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) express pri- marily a myeloid phenotype, but in others, such as poly- cythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and  essential thrombocytosis (ET), erythroid or megakaryo- cytic hyperplasia predominates. The latter three disor- ders, in contrast to the former three, also appear capable  of transforming into each other. Such phenotypic het- erogeneity has a genetic basis. CML is the consequence  of the balanced translocation between chromosomes   9 and 22 (t[9;22][q34;11]), CNL has been associated with  a t(15;19) translocation, and CEL occurs with a deletion  or balanced translocations involving the PDGFR-alpha  gene. By contrast, to a greater or lesser extent, PV, PMF,  and ET are characterized by expression of a JAK2 muta- tion, V617F, that causes constitutive activation of this  tyrosine kinase that is essential for the function of the  erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors but not  the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. This  essential distinction is also reflected in the natural history  of CML, CNL, and CEL, which is usually measured in  years, and their high rate of transformation into acute  leukemia. By contrast, the natural history of PV, PMF,  and ET is usually measured in decades, and transforma- tion to acute leukemia is uncommon in the absence of  exposure to mutagenic agents. Primary effusion lym- phoma is not a myeloproliferative disease. It is one of  the diseases (Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma, multicentric Castlemanâ€™s  disease) associated with infection with human herpes  virus-8, particularly in immunocompromised hosts.","

Answer: E. Primary effusion lymphoma

Explanation:

A, B, C, and D are all myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which are characterized by the clonal expansion of one or more myeloid lineages. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) or the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. Essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) are characterized by the clonal expansion of megakaryocytes and erythrocytes, respectively. Mastocytosis is a clonal disorder of mast cells.

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily involves the serous cavities, such as the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum. It is not a myeloproliferative disorder.","
E. Primary effusion lymphoma

Explanation:
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the presence of malignant cells in body fluids, such as pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal effusions, without an identifiable tumor mass. It is not classified as a myeloproliferative disorder in the WHO classification system. Myeloproliferative disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), essential thrombocythemia (ET), mastocytosis, and polycythemia vera (PV), which are characterized by the overproduction of one or more myeloid lineages in the bone marrow.",1,1
30,Which of the following statements regarding poly- cythemia vera is correct? A. An elevated plasma erythropoietin level excludes the  diagnosis. B. Transformation to acute leukemia is common. C. Thrombocytosis correlates strongly with thrombotic  risk. D. Aspirin should be prescribed to all of these patients  to reduce thrombotic risk. E. Phlebotomy is used only after hydroxyurea and  interferon have been tried.,"The answer is A.  (Chap. 13) Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal disorder  that involves a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor  cell. Clinically, it is characterized by a proliferation of  red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes, and platelets. The  precise etiology is unknown. Unlike chronic myeloid  leukemia, no consistent cytogenetic abnormality has  been associated with the disorder. However, a muta- tion in the autoinhibitory, pseudokinase domain of the  tyrosine kinase JAK2â€”that replaces valine with phenyl- alanine (V617F), causing constitutive activation of the  kinaseâ€”appears to have a central role in the pathogen- esis of PV. Erythropoiesis is regulated by the hormone  erythropoietin. Hypoxia is the physiologic stimulus that  increases the number of cells that produce erythropoi- etin. Erythropoietin may be elevated in patients with  hormone-secreting tumors. Levels are usually â€œnormalâ€_x009d_  in patients with hypoxic erythrocytosis. In PV, how- ever, because erythrocytosis occurs independently of  erythropoietin, levels of the hormone are usually low.  Therefore, an elevated level is not consistent with the  diagnosis. PV is a chronic, indolent disease with a low  rate of transformation to acute leukemia, especially in  the absence of treatment with radiation or hydroxy- urea. Thrombotic complications are the main risk for  PV and correlate with the erythrocytosis. Thrombocy- tosis, although sometimes prominent, does not correlate  with the risk of thrombotic complications. Salicylates are  useful in treating erythromelalgia but are not indicated  in asymptomatic patients. There is no evidence that  thrombotic risk is significantly lowered with their use in  patients whose hematocrits are appropriately controlled  with phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treat- ment. Induction of a state of iron deficiency is critical to  prevent a reexpansion of the RBC mass. Chemothera- peutics and other agents are useful in cases of symptom- atic splenomegaly. Their use is limited by side effects,  and there is a risk of leukemogenesis with hydroxyurea.","

(Chap. 13) Chronic primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is the  least common myeloproliferative disorder and is considered   Review and Self-Assessment 761 a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of myelofi- brosis have been ruled out. The typical patient with PMF  presents in the sixth decade of life, and the disorder is  asymptomatic in many patients. Fevers, fatigue, night  sweats, and weight loss may occur in PMF, but these  symptoms are rare in other myeloproliferative disorders.  However, no signs or symptoms are specific for the diag- nosis of PMF. Often marked splenomegaly is present and  may extend across the midline and to the pelvic brim. A  peripheral blood smear demonstrates the typical findings  of myelofibrosis, including teardrop-shaped red blood  cells (RBCs), nucleated RBCs, myelocytes, and metamy- elocytes that are indicative of extramedullary hematopoi- esis. Anemia is usually mild, and platelet and leukocyte  counts are often normal. About 50% of patients with  PMF have the JAK2 V617F mutation. Bone marrow  aspirate is frequently unsuccessful because the extent  of marrow fibrosis makes aspiration impossible. When  a bone marrow biopsy is performed, it demonstrates  hypercellular marrow with trilineage hyperplasia and  increased number of megakaryocytes with large dysplas- tic nuclei. Interestingly, individuals with PMF often have  associated autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor,  antinuclear antibodies, or positive Coombs test results.  To diagnose someone as having PMF, it must be shown  that he or she does not have another myeloproliferative  disorder or hematologic malignancy that is the cause of  myelofibrosis. The most common disorders that present  in a similar fashion to PMF are polycythemia vera and  chronic myeloid leukemia. Other nonmalignant disor- ders that can cause myelofibrosis include HIV infection,  hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, systemic  lupus erythematosus, tuberculosis, and bone marrow  replacement in other cancers such as prostate and breast  cancer. In the patient described here, there is no other  identifiable cause of myelofibrosis; thus, chronic PMF  can be diagnosed.","

Answer: D. Systemic lupus erythematosus.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, early satiety, and splenomegaly, along with the laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis with left shift, and a positive rheumatoid factor, are suggestive of an underlying inflammatory process. The absence of blasts on the peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, along with the presence of teardrop cells and nucleated red blood cells, are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. The presence of a positive rheumatoid factor is also a common finding in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, the most likely cause of the splenomegaly in this patient is SLE.

D. Systemic lupus erythematosus

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, early satiety, and splenomegaly, along with the positive rheumatoid factor, suggest a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of teardrop cells, nucleated red blood cells, and immature granulocytes on the peripheral blood smear are also consistent with SLE. The bone marrow biopsy being unsuccessful does not rule out SLE as the cause of the splenomegaly.

Iron-deficiency anemia B. Essential thrombocytosis C. Chronic myeloid leukemia D. Myelodysplasia E. Pernicious anemia","The answer is E. (Chap. 13) Thrombocytosis may be â€œprimaryâ€_x009d_ or â€œsec- ondary.â€_x009d_ Essential thrombocytosis is a myeloproliferative  disorder that involves a multipotent hematopoietic pro- genitor cell. Unfortunately, no clonal marker can  reliably  distinguish it from more common nonclonal, reactive  forms of thrombocytosis.

Common causes of secondary thrombocytosis include  infection, inflammatory conditions, malignancy, iron  deficiency, hemorrhage, and postsurgical states. Other  myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myeloid  leukemia and myelofibrosis, may result in thrombocy- tosis. Similarly, myelodysplastic syndromes, particularly  the 5q-syndrome, may cause thrombocytosis. Perni- cious anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency does not  typically cause thrombocytosis.

Answer: A. Iron-deficiency anemia.

Explanation:
Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the level of iron in the body, leading to a decrease in the production of hemoglobin and, consequently, a decrease in the number of red blood cells. However, it is not a common cause of thrombocytosis, which is an increase in the number of platelets in the blood. The other options listed, such as essential thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplasia, are all conditions that can cause thrombocytosis. Pernicious anemia is a type of megaloblastic anemia caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or intrinsic factor, which can lead to an increase in mean platelet volume but not necessarily an increase in platelet count.","

33,"A 38-year-old woman is referred for evaluation  of an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit that  was discovered during an evaluation of recurrent  headaches. Until about 8 months previously, she  was in good health, but she developed increasingly     persistent headaches with intermittent vertigo and   tinnitus. She was originally prescribed sumatriptan  for presumed migraine headaches but did not expe- rience relief of her symptoms. A CT scan of the  brain showed no evidence of mass lesion.  During  evaluation of her headaches, she was found to have a  hemoglobin of 17.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 52%.  Her only other symptom is diffuse itching after hot  showers. She is a nonsmoker. She has no history  pulmonary or cardiac disease. On physical examina- tion, she appears well. Her body mass index is 22.3  kg/m2. Vital signs are blood pressure of 148/84 mm  Hg, heart rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of  12 breaths/min, and SaO2 of 99% on room air. She  is afebrile.

Which of  the following tests should be performed next in the  evaluation of this patient? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Erythropoietin level C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation D. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase E. Red blood cell mass and plasma volume determination","The answer is E.  (Chap. 13) In a patient presenting with an elevated  hemoglobin and hematocrit, the initial step in the evalu- ation is to determine whether erythrocytosis represents a  true elevation in red blood cell (RBC) mass or whether  spurious erythrocytosis is present because of plasma vol- ume contraction. (See Figure 35.) This step may be not  necessary, however, in individuals with hemoglobin >20  g/dL. After absolute erythrocytosis has been determined  by measurement of RBC mass and plasma volume, the  cause of erythrocytosis must be determined. If there is  not an obvious cause of the erythrocytosis, an erythro- poietin level should be checked. An elevated erythropoi- etin level suggests hypoxia or autonomous production of  erythropoietin as the cause of erythrocytosis. However,  a normal erythropoietin level does not exclude hypoxia  as a cause. A low erythropoietin level should be seen in  the myeloproliferative disorder polycythemia vera (PV),  the most likely cause of erythrocytosis in this patient. PV  is often discovered incidentally when elevated hemo- globin is found during testing for other reasons. When  symptoms are present, the most common complaints are  related to hyperviscosity of the blood and include ver- tigo, headache, tinnitus, and transient ischemic attacks.  Patients may also complain of pruritus after showering.  Erythromelalgia is the term give to the symptom complex  of burning, pain, and erythema in the extremities and is  associated with thrombocytosis in PV. Isolated systolic  hypertension and splenomegaly may be found. In addi- tion to elevated red RBC mass and low erythropoietin  levels, other laboratory findings in PV include throm- bocytosis and leukocytosis with abnormal leukocytes  present. Uric acid levels and leukocyte alkaline phos- phatase may be elevated but are not diagnostic for PV.  Approximately 30% of individuals with PV are homo- zygous for the JAK2 V617F mutation, and >90% are  heterozygous for this mutation. This mutation located  on the short arm of chromosome 9 causes constitutive  activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) protein, a tyrosine  kinase that renders erythrocytes resistant to apoptosis  and allows them to continue production independently  from erythropoietin. However, not every patient with  PV expresses this mutation, and approximately 50% of  patients with chronic myelofibrosis and essential throm- bocytosis express this mutation. Thus, it is not recom- mended as an initial diagnostic test for PV but may be  used for confirmatory purposes. Bone marrow biopsy  provides no specific information in PV and is not rec- ommended.  Review and Self-Assessment 762","

Answer: C. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of headaches, tinnitus, vertigo, and elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit are consistent with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by overproduction of all three cell lines in the bone marrow, but predominantly erythrocytes. The JAK2 V617F mutation is a common genetic mutation associated with PV and other myeloproliferative neoplasms. Therefore, genetic testing for this mutation is the next appropriate step in the evaluation of this patient. Other tests, such as bone marrow biopsy, erythropoietin level, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, and red blood cell mass and plasma volume determination, may be indicated later in the diagnostic workup or for monitoring disease progression, but are not the next appropriate test in this case.","
B. Erythropoietin level.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of persistent headaches, tinnitus, and vertigo, along with her elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggest the possibility of a primary polycythemia or secondary polycythemia due to erythropoietin-producing tumors. Erythropoietin level measurement is the next appropriate test to determine if the patient has primary or secondary polycythemia. If the erythropoietin level is elevated, it would support the diagnosis of primary polycythemia. If the erythropoietin level is normal or low, it would suggest secondary polycythemia, and further investigation would be needed to identify the underlying cause. A bone marrow biopsy may be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain or if there is suspicion of myeloproliferative neoplasm. Genetic testing for JAK2 V617F mutation is appropriate for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms, but it is not the next appropriate test in this case as the patient",0,0

Trisomy 12  Review and Self-Assessment 732","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) This patient presents with typical findings of  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which has an inci- dence of 1.5 per 100,000 people yearly. The typical age  of onset is in the mid forties, and there is a slight male  predominance. Half of individuals are asymptomatic at  the time of diagnosis. If symptoms are present, they are  typically nonspecific and include fatigue and weight loss.  Occasionally, patients have symptoms related to splenic  enlargement such as early satiety and left upper quad- rant pain. Laboratory findings are suggestive of CML.  A high leukocyte count of 100,000/Î¼L is typical, with  a predominant granulocytic differential, including neu- trophils, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and band forms.  The circulating blast count should be <5%. Anemia and  thrombocytosis are also common. The bone marrow  demonstrates nonspecific increase in cellularity with an  increase in the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio. The diagnosis  of CML is established by identifying a clonal expansion  of a hematopoietic stem cell possessing a reciprocal trans- location between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translo- cation results in the head-to-tail fusion of the breakpoint  cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11 with  the ABL1 (named after the Abelson murine leukemia  virus) gene located on chromosome 9q34.

Explanation: The given clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is typically associated with the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) translocation. However, the given cytogenetic abnormality listed is not the Ph1 translocation. Instead, the patient's bone marrow biopsy shows increased cellularity with an increased myeloid to erythroid ratio, which is more consistent with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), such as polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. Trisomy 12 is a cytogenetic abnormality commonly found in MPNs, particularly in myelofibrosis. Therefore, the most likely answer is E. Trisomy 12.","
Based on the given information, the most likely cytogenetic abnormality in this patient is a deletion of a portion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del(5q)). This abnormality is commonly associated with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and bone marrow dysplasia. The symptoms described in the scenario, such as early satiety, weight loss, and a palpable spleen, are consistent with MDS. The laboratory findings, including a leukocytosis with a left shift and a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, are also consistent with this diagnosis. The bone marrow biopsy demonstrating increased cellularity with an increased myeloid to erythroid ratio is also consistent with MDS. Del(5q) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in MDS, accounting for approximately 20-30% of cases. Therefore, it is the most likely answer based on the given information.

(Chap. 14) The acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are a  group of hematologic malignancies derived from hema- tologic stem cells that have acquired chromosomal muta- tions that prevent differentiation into mature myeloid  cells. The specific chromosomal abnormalities predict  in which stage of differentiation the cell is arrested and  are associated with the several subtypes of AML that  have been identified. In the United States, >16,000  new cases of AML are diagnosed yearly, and the num- bers of new cases of AML has increased in the past   10 years. Men are diagnosed with AML more frequently  than women (4.6 cases per 100,000 population vs 3.0  cases per 100,000, respectively). In addition, older age  is associated with increased incidence of AML, with an  incidence of 18.6 cases per 100,000 population in those  older than 65 years of age. AML is uncommon in adoles- cents. Other known risk factors for the development of  AML include hereditary genetic abnormalities, radiation  and chemical exposures, and drugs.

The statement B is incorrect. Individuals exposed to high-dose radiation, including those treated with therapeutic radiation, are at an increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia. However, the risk is significantly higher when radiation is combined with alkylating agents. Therefore, the correct statement would be: Individuals exposed to high-dose radiation are at risk for acute myeloid leukemia, and the risk is increased when radiation is combined with alkylating agents.

Leukapheresis","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) The goal of therapy in chronic myeloid leu- kemia (CML) is to achieve prolonged, durable, non- neoplastic, nonclonal hematopoiesis, which entails the  eradication of any residual cells containing the BCR- ABL1 transcript. Hence, the goal is complete molecular  remission and cure. Therapy of CML has changed in  recent years because of the presence of a proven curative   Review and Self-Assessment 763 treatment (allogeneic transplantation) that has significant  toxicity and a targeted treatment (imatinib) with out- standing outcome based on 8-year follow-up data. New  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are becoming available, mak- ing this a dynamic topic. Many experts currently recom- mend initiating therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and reserving allogeneic transplantation for those who  develop drug resistance. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine  kinase inhibitor that acts to decrease the activity of the  bcr-abl fusion protein that results from the recipro- cal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (Philadel- phia chromosome). It acts as a competitive inhibitor of  the abl kinase at its ATP binding site and thus leads to  inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in  bcr-abl signal transduction. In newly diagnosed CML,  imatinib results in a complete hematologic remission in  95% of patients initially and 76% at 18 months. Low- risk patients have a higher durable remission rate. All  imatinib-treated patients who achieved major molecular  remission (26%), defined as 3 log or greater reduction  in BCR-ABL1 transcript level at 18 months compared  with pretreatment level, were progression free at 5 years.  There is a consensus that molecular responses can be  used as a treatment goal in CML. Imatinib, taken orally,  has limited side effects that include nausea, fluid reten- tion, diarrhea, and skin rash and is usually well tolerated.  Interferon-Î± was previously the first-line chemotherapy  if bone marrow transplant was not an option, but it has  been replaced by imatinib mesylate. Autologous stem cell  transplant is not currently used for treatment of CML  because there is no reliable way to select residual normal  hematopoietic progenitor cells. Leukopheresis is used for  control of leukocyte counts when the patient is experi- encing complications such as respiratory failure or cere- bral ischemia related to the high white blood cell count.","

Answer: A. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

Explanation: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) or the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The patient's presenting leukocyte count is high, and her hematocrit is low, indicating anemia. However, she is asymptomatic and has no circulating blasts, which suggests that she is in the chronic phase of the disease.

The best initial therapy for CML in the chronic phase is typically tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). However, in this scenario, the patient is Philadelphia chromosome positive and has no siblings, making an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) the preferred option for long-term disease control and potential cure.

Autologous stem cell transplant is not the best option for CML in the chronic phase, as it does not provide the same graft-versus-leukemia effect as an allogeneic","C. Imatinib mesylate

Explanation:
The patient is diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, Philadelphia chromosome positive, with an asymptomatic presentation, and a low leukocyte count with <2% circulating blasts. This clinical presentation is consistent with the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. The best initial therapy for this patient is Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is the standard of care for chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant and autologous stem cell transplant are reserved for patients in the advanced phases of the disease or those who are intolerant to or resistant to Imatinib mesylate. Interferon-Î± is an older treatment modality that is less effective and has more side effects compared to Imatinib mesylate. Leukapheresis is not indicated in this scenario as the patient does not have symptomatic hyperleukocytosis.",0,1

Review of  the peripheral blood smear confirms acute myeloid  leukemia (M1 subtype, myeloblastic leukemia with- out maturation) with complex chromosomal abnor- malities on cytogenetics. All of the following confer  a poor prognosis for this patient EXCEPT: A. Advanced age B. Complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics  Review and Self-Assessment 733 C. Hemoglobin below 7 g/dL D. Prolonged interval between symptom onset and  diagnosis E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L","The answer is C.  (Chap. 14) Patients with acute leukemia frequently pres- ent with nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and weight  loss. In addition, weight loss and anorexia are also com- mon. About half have had symptoms for >3 months at  the time of presentation. Fever is present in only about  10% of patients at presentation, and 5% have evidence of  abnormal hemostasis. On physical examination, hepato- megaly, splenomegaly, sternal tenderness, and evidence  of infection or hemorrhage are common presenting signs.  Laboratory studies are confirmatory with evidence of  anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis often pres- ent. The median presenting leukocyte count at presenta- tion is 15,000/Î¼L. About 20â€“40% have presenting leu- kocyte counts <5000/Î¼L, and another 20% have counts  >100,000/Î¼L. Review of the peripheral smear confirms  leukemia in most cases. If Auer rods are seen, the diagno- sis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is virtually certain.  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100,000/Î¼L) is seen  in >75% of individuals with AML. After the diagnosis  of AML has been confirmed, rapid evaluation and treat- ment should be undertaken. The general health of the  cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems  should be evaluated because chemotherapy has adverse  effects that may cause organ dysfunction in any of these  systems. Overall, chromosome findings at diagnosis are  currently the most important independent prognostic   factor. Patients with t(15;17) have a very good prognosis    Review and Self-Assessment 764 (~85% cured), and those with t(8;21) and inv(16) have a  good prognosis (~55% cured), but those with no cytoge- netic abnormality have a moderately favorable outcome  (~40% cured). Patients with a complex karyotype, t(6;9),  inv(3), or â€“7, have a very poor prognosis. Among the  prognostic factors that predict poor outcomes in AML,  age at diagnosis is one of the most important because indi- viduals of advanced age tolerate induction chemotherapy  poorly. In addition, advanced age is more likely to be  associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities that  predict poorer response to chemotherapy, although some  chromosomal markers predict a better response to che- motherapy. Poor performance status independent of age  also decreases survival in AML. Responsiveness to chemo- therapy and survival are also worse if the leukocyte count  is >100,000/Î¼L or the antecedent course of symptoms  is prolonged. Anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytope- nia present for >3 months is a poor prognostic indicator.  However, there is no absolute degree of anemia or throm- bocytopenia that predicts worse outcomes.","

Answer: E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), specifically the M1 subtype, which is characterized by the absence of maturation of myeloblasts. The presence of complex chromosomal abnormalities on cytogenetics is a poor prognostic factor in AML, and advanced age, hemoglobin below 7 g/dL, and a prolonged interval between symptom onset and diagnosis are also associated with a poor prognosis. However, a high WBC count (>100,000/Î¼L) is actually a favorable prognostic factor in AML, as it indicates a higher proportion of mature granulocytes in the peripheral blood, which can help to reduce the risk of infection. Therefore, option E is the incorrect answer.","
E. WBC count above 100,000/Î¼L

Explanation:
The given patient is diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with complex chromosomal abnormalities, advanced age, low hemoglobin level, and a prolonged interval between symptom onset and diagnosis. However, a high WBC count is not necessarily a poor prognostic factor in AML. In fact, some studies suggest that a high WBC count may be associated with a better prognosis, particularly in older patients. Therefore, option E is the answer to this question.",0,0
38,The evaluation in a newly diagnosed case of acute  lymphoid leukemia should routinely include all of  the following EXCEPT: A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Cell-surface phenotyping C. Cytogenetic testing D. Lumbar puncture E. Plasma viscosity,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 15) Viscosity testing is typically reserved for cases  of multiple myeloma in which paraproteins (particularly  immunoglobulin M) can lead to vascular sludging and  subsequent tissue ischemia. Acute lymphoid leukemia  (ALL) can lead to end-organ abnormalities in the kidney  and liver; therefore, routine chemistry tests are indicated.  A lumbar puncture must be performed in cases of newly  diagnosed ALL to rule out spread of disease to the central  nervous system. Bone marrow biopsy reveals the degree  of marrow infiltration and is often necessary for classifica- tion of the tumor. Immunologic cell-surface marker test- ing often identifies the cell lineage involved and the type  of tumor, information that is often impossible to discern  from morphologic interpretation alone. Cytogenetic test- ing provides prognostic information on the disease natu- ral history. In ALL, the prognosis depends on the genetic  characteristics of the tumor, the patientâ€™s age, the white  blood cell count, and the patientâ€™s overall clinical status and  major organ function.","

Answer: E. Plasma viscosity.

Explanation: In the evaluation of a newly diagnosed case of acute lymphoid leukemia, all of the listed tests are important for establishing the diagnosis and determining the subtype and prognosis of the disease. However, plasma viscosity is not a routine test in the evaluation of acute lymphoid leukemia. Plasma viscosity is a measure of the thickness and stickiness of the blood plasma and is typically used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, which are types of plasma cell disorders.","
E. Plasma viscosity

Explanation:
Plasma viscosity is not a routine test in the evaluation of a newly diagnosed case of acute lymphoid leukemia. The other tests listed, such as bone marrow biopsy, cell-surface phenotyping, and cytogenetic testing, are essential for the diagnosis and characterization of acute lymphoid leukemia.",1,1
39,All of the following infectious agents have been  associated with development of a lymphoid malig- nancy EXCEPT: A. Helicobacter pylori B. Hepatitis B C. Hepatitis C D. HIV E. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8),"The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Hepatitis B and C are both common causes  of cirrhosis and are strongly associated with the devel- opment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C, but  not hepatitis B, can also lead to a lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma, often in the spleen, that resolves with cure  of hepatitis C. Epstein-Barr virus has been associated  with a large number of lymphoid malignancies, includ- ing posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD),  Hodgkinâ€™s disease, central nervous system lymphoma,  and Burkittâ€™s lymphoma. Helicobacter pylori infection is  necessary and sufficient for gastric mucosa-associated  lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma development, and  cure can be achieved with eradication of the organism in  some cases. HHV8 is a known cause of body cavity lym- phoma, including primary pleural lymphoma. In addi- tion to those listed, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1  is associated with adult T-cell lymphoma or leukemia.  Other disorders associated with lymphoma include  celiac sprue, autoimmune disease, and biologic therapies  for autoimmune disease. Celiac sprue has been associated  with gastrointestinal tract lymphoma. Many collagen  vascular diseases (e.g., Sjogrenâ€™s disease) and antiâ€“tumor  necrosis factor therapies have been associated with the  development of lymphoma.","

Answer: A. Helicobacter pylori

Explanation: Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that causes chronic gastritis and is associated with peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. It is not a known cause of lymphoid malignancies. The other agents listed, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, and HHV8, are all associated with various types of lymphoid malignancies.","
A. Helicobacter pylori

Explanation:
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that has been associated with the development of gastritis and peptic ulcers. However, it has also been linked to an increased risk of developing certain types of lymphoid malignancies, including gastric MALT lymphoma and gastric carcinoma. Therefore, it is not an exception to the query.

The other infectious agents listed, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and HHV8, have all been associated with the development of various types of lymphoid malignancies. Hepatitis B and C are known risk factors for liver-associated lymphomas, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. HIV is a risk factor for various types of lymphoid malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma. HHV8 is a risk factor for Kaposi sarcoma and certain types of Castleman disease.",0,0

His initial evaluation  should include all of the following EXCEPT: A. AST, ALT, and prothrombin time B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Coombs test D. Peripheral blood smear E. Physical examination","The answer is B.  (Chap. 15) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and throm- bocytopenia are common, and a peripheral blood smear  and a Coombs test help evaluate their presence. Hyper- splenism is also seen in chronic lymphoid leukemia  (CLL) as the spleen sequesters large numbers of circulat- ing blood cells and enlarges. Hence, a careful left upper  quadrant examination looking for a palpable splenic tip  is the standard of care in this situation. This patient is at  risk of hepatic decompensation as well, given his hepati- tis C that can also cause anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Bone marrow infiltration of tumor cells can lead to cyto- penias in CLL. However, this is in effect a diagnosis of  exclusion. After these three possibilities have been ruled  out, a bone marrow biopsy is a reasonable next step.  This initial evaluation before presuming spread of CLL is  critical for therapy because each possibility requires dif- ferent therapy (glucocorticoids or rituximab for hemoly- sis, hepatology referral for liver failure, and splenectomy  for symptomatic hypersplenism).","

Answer: E. Physical examination","
E. Physical examination

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia warrant further investigation. The initial evaluation should include a bone marrow biopsy to assess for the presence of marrow failure or infiltrative disease, as well as a peripheral blood smear to evaluate for morphologic abnormalities. Additionally, laboratory tests such as AST, ALT, and prothrombin time are important to assess for liver function and coagulation status, respectively. The Coombs test is used to evaluate for the presence of antibodies against red blood cells, which may indicate hemolysis. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Physical examination.",0,0

Burkitt's lymphoma has the best prognosis among the given lymphoma types when treated appropriately. The data from the provided study shows that the best overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) at 12 months were observed in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. The ORR was 82% (54% CR) and the DOR at 12 months was 11.1 months. Additionally, the data shows that the median follow-up for the trial was 27 months, indicating a longer-term follow-up and potentially better outcomes for these patients.

Hodgkinâ€™s  disease occurs in 8000 patients in the United States  each year, and the disease does not appear to be increas- ing in frequency. Most patients present with palpable  lymphadenopathy that is nontender; in most patients,  these lymph nodes are in the neck, supraclavicular area,  and axilla. More than half the patients have mediasti- nal adenopathy at diagnosis, and this is sometimes the  initial manifestation. A subdiaphragmatic presentation of  Hodgkinâ€™s disease is unusual and more common in older  men. One-third of patients present with fevers, night  sweats, or weight loss, which are B symptoms in the  Ann Arbor staging classification.

Answer: E. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Explanation: The given patient's symptoms and the appearance of the lymph node in the image (Figure 47) are consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The absence of fever, chills, throat pain, and other associated symptoms, along with the patient's age and sexually active lifestyle, make infections such as cat scratch disease (C) and CMV infection (B) less likely. Burkitt's lymphoma (A) typically presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, often in the abdomen, and is more common in children. Hodgkin's disease (D) usually presents with painless, firm, and discrete lymph nodes, often in a specific sequence.","E. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, such as enlarging, nontender lymph nodes, and a lack of associated symptoms like fever, chills, or weight loss, are consistent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The lymph node biopsy result, as shown in Figure 47, further supports this diagnosis.

It is often associated with myeloid neoplasm. D. More than 90% of cases are confined to the skin. E. Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common clinical  manifestation.,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 16) Mastocytosis is a proliferation and accumula- tion of mast cells in one or more organ systems. Only  the skin is involved in approximately 80% of cases with  the other 20% being defined as systemic mastocytosis  caused by the involvement of another organ system. The  most common manifestation of mastocytosis is cutaneous  urticaria pigmentosa, a maculopapular pigmented rash  involving the papillary dermis. Other cutaneous forms  include diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (almost entirely  in children) and mastocytoma. Clinical manifestations of  systemic mastocytosis are related to either cellular infil- tration of organs or release of histamine, proteases, eico- sanoids, or heparin from mast cells. Therefore, signs and  symptoms may include constitutional symptoms, skin  manifestations (pruritus, dermatographia, rash), medi- ator-related symptoms (abdominal pain, flushing, syn- cope, hypertension, diarrhea), and bone-related symp- toms (fracture, pain, arthralgia). In a recent series, 40%  of patients with systemic mastocytosis had an associated  myeloid neoplasm, most commonly myeloproliferative  syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplas- tic syndrome. Eosinophilia was present in approximately  one-third of patients. Elevated serum tryptase, bone mar- row involvement, splenomegaly, skeletal involvement,  cytopenia, and malabsorption predict more aggressive  disease and a worse prognosis. Many patients with sys- temic mastocytosis have an activating mutation of c-Kit,  a kinase inhibited by imatinib; however, the mutation  appears relatively resistant to this agent.","

Answer: E. Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common clinical manifestation.

Explanation:
Mastocytosis is a group of disorders characterized by the clonal proliferation of mast cells in one or more organs. The most common clinical manifestations include cutaneous symptoms such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, angioedema, and erythema multiforme-like lesions. However, mastocytosis can also involve other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, and lungs.

Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are true statements regarding mastocytosis.

Option E is incorrect because urticaria pigmentosa is not the most common clinical manifestation of mastocytosis. While it is a common presentation, other forms of mastocytosis, such as systemic mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia, can also occur and may not present with urticaria pigmentosa.","D. More than 90% of cases are confined to the skin.

Explanation:
Mastocytosis is a group of disorders characterized by the clonal proliferation of mast cells. The disease can manifest in various ways, including cutaneous, systemic, and organ-limited forms. While the majority of cases present with cutaneous involvement, systemic manifestations are common and can affect multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and hematopoietic system. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that more than 90% of cases are confined to the skin.

Additionally, eosinophilia is a common finding in mastocytosis, and elevated serum tryptase levels are indicative of systemic involvement and can suggest aggressive disease. Mastocytosis is also associated with myeloid neoplasms, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute myeloid leukemia. Urticaria pigmentosa is a common clinical manifestation of cutaneous mastocytosis, but other forms of mastocytosis, such as systemic mastocyt",0,1

Chest radiograph  shows a right upper lobe alveolar infiltrate, and  laboratory test results are notable for a blood urea  nitrogen of 53 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, cal- cium of 12.3 mg/dL, total protein of 9 g/dL, and  albumin of 3.1 g/dL. Sputum culture grows Strep- tococcus pneumonia. Which of the following tests will  confirm the underlying condition predisposing him  to pneumococcal pneumonia? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and  pelvis with contrast C. HIV antibody D. Sweat chloride testing E. Videoscopic swallow study","The answer is A.  (Chap. 17) The patient presents with pneumococcal  pneumonia and evidence of hypercalcemia, renal fail- ure, and a wide protein gap suggestive of an M pro- tein. These findings are classic for multiple myeloma.  Although the patient appears to be making large quan- tities of immunoglobulins, they are in fact generally  monoclonal, and patients actually have functional hypo- gammaglobulinemia related to both decreased produc- tion and increased destruction of normal antibodies. This  hypogammaglobulinemia predisposes patients to infec- tions, most commonly pneumonia with pneumococcus  or Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative pyelonephritis.  Bone marrow biopsy would confirm the presence of  clonal plasma cells and define the quantity, which will  help define treatment options. A serum protein electro- phoresis would also be indicated to prove the presence  of the M protein suspected by the wide protein gap.  Although HIV may be associated with kidney injury,  both acute and chronic, hypercalcemia would be an  unusual feature. There is no clinical history of aspira- tion, and the location of infiltrate, upper lobe, is unusual  for aspiration. Sweat chloride testing is not indicated  because there is no suspicion for cystic fibrosis. Because  solid organ malignancy is not suspected, computed  tomography of the body is unlikely to be helpful.","

Answer: C. HIV antibody.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of sudden onset cough with yellow sputum production, dyspnea, and a right upper lobe alveolar infiltrate on chest radiograph is consistent with pneumonia. The laboratory test results, including a low albumin level, suggest a possible underlying condition that may predispose the patient to pneumococcal pneumonia. HIV infection is a well-known risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia. Therefore, HIV antibody testing is the most appropriate test to confirm the underlying condition predisposing the patient to pneumococcal pneumonia. Bone marrow biopsy, computed tomography, sweat chloride testing, and videoscopic swallow study are not indicated in this scenario.","
C. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and chest radiograph findings are consistent with community-acquired pneumonia. However, certain underlying conditions can increase the risk of developing pneumococcal pneumonia. One such condition is an impaired immune system, which can be assessed through various tests. Among the options provided, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast is the most likely test to reveal underlying conditions that may predispose the patient to pneumococcal pneumonia. This test can help identify conditions such as lung cancer, lymphoma, or other underlying diseases that may weaken the immune system and increase the risk of bacterial infections like pneumococcal pneumonia.

46,"A 64-year-old African American man is evaluated in  the hospital for congestive heart failure, renal failure,  and polyneuropathy. Physical examination on admis- sion was notable for these findings and raised waxy  papules in the axilla and inguinal region. Admission  laboratories showed a blood urea nitrogen of 90 mg/ dL and a creatinine of 6.3 mg/dL. Total protein  was 9.0 g/dL with an albumin of 3.2 g/dL. Hema- tocrit was 24%, and white blood cell and platelet  counts were normal. Urinalysis was remarkable for  3+ proteinuria but no cellular casts. Further evalu- ation included an echocardiogram with a thickened  left ventricle and preserved systolic function. Which  of the following tests is most likely to diagnose the  underlying condition? A. Bone marrow biopsy B. Electromyogram (EMG) with nerve conduction  studies C. Fat pad biopsy D. Right heart catheterization E. Renal ultrasonography","The answer is A.  (Chap. 18) This patient presents with a multisystem ill- ness involving the heart, kidneys, and peripheral ner- vous system. The physical examination is suggestive of  amyloidosis with classic waxy papules in the folds of his  body. The laboratory test results are remarkable for renal  failure of unclear etiology with significant proteinuria  but no cellular casts. A possible etiology of the renal   failure is suggested by the elevated gamma globulin frac- tion and low hematocrit, bringing to mind a monoclo- nal gammopathy perhaps leading to renal failure through  amyloid AL deposition. This could also account for the   Review and Self-Assessment 766 enlarged heart seen on the echocardiography and the  peripheral neuropathy. The fat pad biopsy is generally  reported to be 60â€“80% sensitive for amyloid; how- ever, it would not allow a diagnosis of this patientâ€™s  likely myeloma. A right heart catheterization probably  would prove that the patient has restrictive cardiomy- opathy secondary to amyloid deposition; however, it too  would not diagnose the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.  Renal ultrasonography, although warranted to rule out  obstructive uropathy, would not be diagnostic. Simi- larly, the electromyographic and nerve conduction stud- ies would not be diagnostic. The bone marrow biopsy is  about 50â€“60% sensitive for amyloid, but it would allow  evaluation of the percent of plasma cells in the bone  marrow and allow the diagnosis of multiple myeloma to  be made. Multiple myeloma is associated with amyloid  AL in approximately 20% of cases. Light chains most  commonly deposit systemically in the heart, kidneys,  liver, and nervous system, causing organ dysfunction. In  these organs, biopsy would show the classic eosinophilic  material that, when exposed to Congo red stain, has a  characteristic apple-green birefringence.","

Answer: C. Fat pad biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The underlying causes of nephrotic syndrome include various primary and secondary conditions. In this case, the patient's ethnicity, concurrent heart failure, and the presence of waxy papules (xanthomas) suggest a possible diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the development of xanthomas. A fat pad biopsy is the diagnostic test of choice for FH, as it shows characteristic histological findings of lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) in the fat tissue. Other tests, such as bone marrow biopsy, EMG, renal ultrasonography, and right heart catheterization, are less likely to be diagnostic in this scenario.","
B. Electromyogram (EMG) with nerve conduction studies.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of congestive heart failure, renal failure, and polyneuropathy, along with the physical examination findings of waxy papules and 3+ proteinuria, suggest a diagnosis of light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The most definitive diagnostic test for AL amyloidosis is an electromyogram (EMG) with nerve conduction studies, which can reveal evidence of axonal damage and demyelination caused by the amyloid deposits. Bone marrow biopsy may show evidence of clonal plasma cells, but it is not the most specific test for diagnosing AL amyloidosis. Fat pad biopsy can be used to diagnose amyloidosis, but it is less sensitive and specific than EMG with nerve conduction studies. Renal ultrasonography may show evidence of renal involvement, but it does not diagnose the underlying cause of the amyloidosis. Right heart catheterization is primarily used to evaluate cardiac function and hemodynamics, not to diagnose amy",0,0

The cause of HIT is the formation of antibodies  to the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4).  This complex is able to activate platelets, monocytes,  and endothelial cells. Many patients exposed to heparin  will develop antibodies to the heparinâ€“PF4 complex, but  only a few of these will progress to develop thrombocy- topenia or thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT).  The typical patient will develop evidence of HIT 5 to  14 days after exposure to heparin, although it can occur  within 5 days in individuals exposed to heparin within  about the previous 100 days as would be expected in this  patient given his recent hospitalization. The nadir platelet  count is typically >20,000/Î¼L. When HIT is suspected,  one should not delay treatment for laboratory testing  because no currently available test has adequate sensitiv- ity or specificity for the diagnosis. The antiheparin/PF4  antibody test result is positive in many individuals who  have been exposed to heparin regardless of whether HIT  is present. The platelet activation assay is more specific  but less sensitive for HIT. As soon as HIT is suspected,  heparin should be discontinued and replaced with an  alternative form of anticoagulation to protect against  development of new thromboses. Low-molecular-weight  heparins (LMWHs) such as enoxaparin are not appropri- ate treatment options in individuals with HIT. Although   heparin is 10 times more likely to cause HIT, LMWHs  also cause the illness and should not be used. The primary  agents used for HIT in the United States are the direct  thrombin inhibitors argatroban and lepirudin. Argatroban  is the preferred agent for this patient because of his renal  failure. The drug is not excreted by the kidneys, and  no dosage adjustment is required. In contrast, lepirudin  is markedly increased in renal failure, and a significant  dosage adjustment is required. Danaparoid has previ- ously been used frequently for HIT and HITT, but this  medication is no longer available in the United States.  Other anticoagulants that are used for treatment of HITT  include bivalirudin and fondaparinux, but these also are  not currently approved for use in the United States.","

Answer: A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies.

Explanation:

The patient's platelet count drop from 150,000/Î¼L to 88,000/Î¼L while on heparin therapy raises the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the diagnosis of HIT requires the presence of both thrombocytopenia and evidence of HIT antibodies. Therefore, the most appropriate action at this time is to continue the heparin infusion and assess for HIT antibodies. If HIT is confirmed, alternative anticoagulation options such as argatroban, lepirudin, or danaparoid can be considered. However, discontinuing anticoagulation while awaiting results of HIT antibody testing is not recommended due to the high risk of thrombosis recurrence.","
A. Continue heparin infusion at the current dose and assess for anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 antibodies.

Explanation:
The patient's platelet count drop from 150,000/Î¼L to 88,000/Î¼L after 5 days of heparin infusion is a known complication of heparin therapy, which is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, it is important to note that not all cases of HIT are caused by the development of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin complexes (HIT type 2). HIT type 1, which is not antibody-mediated, can also occur and is characterized by platelet count drop without the presence of antibodies. In this scenario, the most appropriate action would be to continue the heparin infusion and assess for anti-heparin/PF4 antibodies. If the results are positive, then the patient may be switched to an alternative anticoagulant such as argatroban, lepir",0,0
48,"A 48-year-old woman is evaluated by her primary  care physician for a complaint of gingival bleed- ing and easy bruising. She has noted the problem  for about 2 months. Initially, she attributed it to  aspirin that she was taking intermittently for head- aches, but she stopped all aspirin and nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drug use 6 weeks ago. Her only  medical history is an automobile accident 12 years  previously that caused a liver laceration. It required  surgical repair, and she did receive several transfu- sions of red blood cells and platelets at that time.  She currently takes no prescribed medications and  otherwise feels well. On physical examination, she  appears well and healthy. She has no jaundice or  scleral icterus. Her cardiac and pulmonary exami- nation results are normal. The abdominal examina- tion shows a liver span of 12 cm to percussion, and  the edge is palpable 1.5 cm below the right costal  Review and Self-Assessment 735    margin. The spleen tip is not palpable. There are  petechiae present on her extremities and hard pal- ate with a few small ecchymoses on her extremities.  A complete blood count shows a hemoglobin of  12.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 37.6%, white blood cell  count of 8400/Î¼L with a normal differential, and a  platelet count of 7500/Î¼L. What tests are indicated  for the workup of this patientâ€™s thrombocytopenia? A. Antiplatelet antibodies B. Bone marrow biopsy C. Hepatitis C antibody D. Human immunodeficiency antibody E. C and D F. All of the above","The answer is E.  (Chap. 19) This patient presents with symptoms of  thrombocytopenia, including bleeding gums and easy  bruising. The only finding on physical examination  may be petechiae at points of increased venous pressure,  especially in the feet and ankles. The laboratory findings  confirm thrombocytopenia but show no abnormalities in  other cell lines. When evaluating isolated thrombocyto- penia, one must initially consider whether an underlying  infection or medication is causing the platelet count to  fall. There is a long list of medications that are implicated  in thrombocytopenia, including aspirin, acetaminophen,  penicillins, H2 blockers, heparin, and many others. This  patient discontinued all medications over 6 weeks pre- viously, and the platelet count would be expected to  recover if a medication reaction were the cause. She  gives no signs of any acute infection. Thus, the most  likely diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenia purpura  (ITP). This disorder is also known as idiopathic throm- bocytopenia purpura and refers to an immune-mediated  destruction of platelets and possible inhibition of plate- let release from megakaryocytes. ITP can truly be idio- pathic, or it can be secondary to an underlying disorder,  including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV, or  chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The platelet  count can be quite low (<5000/Î¼L) in patients with ITP  and usually presents with mucocutaneous bleeding. Lab- oratory testing for ITP should include a peripheral smear  that typically demonstrates large platelets with other- wise normal morphology. Initial testing should evaluate  for secondary causes of ITP, including HIV antibodies,  HCV antibodies, serologic testing for SLE, serum pro- tein electrophoresis, and immunoglobulins. If anemia is  also present, a direct Coombs test is indicated to assess  whether there is a combined autoimmune hemolytic  anemia with ITP (Evans syndrome). Antiplatelet anti- body testing is not recommended because these tests  have low sensitivity and specificity for ITP. In addition,  bone marrow biopsy is typically not performed unless  there are other abnormalities that are not explained by  ITP or the patient has failed to respond to usual therapy.","

Answer: C and E.

Explanation:

The patient's history of liver laceration and transfusions raises the possibility of post-transfusion viral hepatitis or other viral infections. The presence of petechiae and ecchymoses suggests a coagulopathy, which could be due to a platelet disorder or a consumptive coagulopathy. However, the normal platelet differential argues against a platelet disorder. The patient's history of liver disease and the presence of petechiae and ecchymoses make viral hepatitis and HIV infection potential etiologies. Therefore, both Hepatitis C antibody and Human immunodeficiency antibody tests are indicated. Antiplatelet antibodies are not indicated based on the patient's history and normal platelet differential. A bone marrow biopsy is not indicated at this time, as the patient's peripheral blood count is not suggestive of a bone marrow disorder.","
E. C and D

Explanation:
The patient's history of liver laceration and transfusions, along with the current presentation of easy bruising and petechiae, raises the possibility of a post-transfusion viral infection. Therefore, tests for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus are indicated. Additionally, given the thrombocytopenia, it would be prudent to consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate for potential causes, such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. However, the patient's otherwise normal examination and laboratory findings suggest that the thrombocytopenia is likely not due to a bone marrow disorder. Therefore, the most likely answer is C and D.",1,1
49,Which of the following statements regarding  hemophilia A and B is TRUE? A. Individuals with factor VIII deficiency have a more  severe  clinical course than those with factor IX deficiency. B. Levels of factor VIII or IX need to be measured  before administration of replacement therapy in pa- tients presenting with acute bleeding to calculate the  appropriate dose of factor. C. Primary prophylaxis against bleeding is never indicated. D. The goal level of factor VIII or IX is >50% in the set- ting of large-volume bleeding episodes. E. The life expectancy of individuals with hemophilia is  about 50 years.,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) The hemophilias are X-linked inherited dis- orders that cause deficiency of factor VIII (hemophilia A)  or factor 9 (hemophilia B). The hemophilias affect about  1 in 10,000 males worldwide with hemophilia A respon- sible for 80% of cases. Clinically, there is no difference  between hemophilia A and B. The disease presentation  largely depends on the residual activity of factor VIII or  factor IX. Severe disease is typically seen when factor  activity is <1%, and moderate disease appears when the   levels range between 1% and 5%. The clinical manifesta- tion of moderate and severe disease is commonly bleed- ing into the joints, soft tissues, and  muscles that occurs  after  minimal trauma or even spontaneously. When fac- tor activity is >25%, bleeding would occur only after  major trauma or surgery, and the diagnosis may not be  made unless a prolonged activated partial thromboplas- tin time is seen on routine laboratory examination. To  make a definitive diagnosis, one would need to mea- sure specific levels of factor VIII and IX. Without treat- ment, life expectancy is limited, but given the changes in  therapy since the 1980s, the life span is about 65 years.  Early treatment of hemophilia required the use of pooled  plasma that was used to make factor concentrates. Given  the large number of donors required to generate the fac- tor concentrates and the frequent need for transfusion  in some individuals, bloodborne pathogens such as HIV  and hepatitis C are among the leading cause of death in  patients with hemophilia. In the 1990s, recombinant fac- tor VIII and IX were developed. Primary prophylaxis is  given to individuals with baseline factor activity levels of  <1% to prevent spontaneous bleeding, especially hemar- throses. Although this strategy is highly recommended,  only about 50% of eligible patients receive prophylactic  therapy because of the high costs and need for regular  intravenous infusions. When an individual is suspected  of having a bleed, the treatment should begin as soon  as possible and not delayed until factor activity levels  return. Factor concentrates should be given to raise the  activity level to 50% for large hematomas or deep muscle  bleeds, and an individual may require treatment for a  period of 7 days or more. For milder bleeds, including  uncomplicated hemarthrosis, the goal factor activity level  is 30â€“50% with maintenance of levels between 15% and  25% for 2 to 3 days after the initial transfusions. In addi- tion to treatment with factor concentrates, care should  be taken to avoid medications that inhibit platelet func- tion. DDAVP, a desmopressin analogue, can be given as  adjunctive therapy for acute bleeding episodes in hemo- philia A because this may cause a transient rise in factor  VIII levels and von Willebrand factor because of release  from endothelial cells. This medication is typically only  useful in mild to moderate disease. Antifibrinolytic drugs  such as tranexamic acid or Îµ-amino caproic acid are help- ful in promoting hemostasis for mucosal bleeding.","

Answer: B. Levels of factor VIII or IX need to be measured before administration of replacement therapy in patients presenting with acute bleeding to calculate the appropriate dose of factor.","A. Individuals with factor VIII deficiency have a more severe clinical course than those with factor IX deficiency.

Explanation:
Factor VIII and IX are coagulation factors that play crucial roles in the hemostatic process. Factor VIII deficiency, also known as hemophilia A, is more common than factor IX deficiency, also known as hemophilia B. Individuals with hemophilia A typically have more severe bleeding episodes and a greater risk of complications due to the larger role factor VIII plays in the coagulation cascade.

Therefore, statement A is the correct answer.

The other statements are not necessarily true:
B. Correct, factor levels need to be measured before administering replacement therapy to calculate the appropriate dose.
C. False, primary prophylaxis against bleeding is indicated in severe hemophilia to prevent spontaneous bleeding.
D. False, the goal level of factor VIII or IX varies depending on the clinical situation and the severity of bleeding. In general, levels above 50% are considered adequate for most situations, but higher levels may be required for major bleeding episodes or surgical procedures.

Platelets","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  is a consumptive coagulopathy that is characterized by  diffuse intravascular fibrin formation that overcomes the  bodyâ€™s natural anticoagulant mechanisms. DIC is most  commonly associated with sepsis, trauma, or malignancy  or in obstetric complications. The pathogenesis of DIC  is not completely elucidated, but it involves intravascular  exposure to phospholipids from damaged tissue, hemo- lysis, and endothelial damage. This leads to stimulation of  procoagulant pathways with uncontrolled thrombin gen- eration and microvascular ischemia. A secondary hyper- fibrinolysis subsequently occurs. The primary  clinical   Review and Self-Assessment 768 manifestations of DIC are bleeding at venipuncture sites,  petechiae, and ecchymoses. Severe gastrointestinal and  pulmonary hemorrhage can occur. The clinical diagnosis  of DIC is based on laboratory findings in the appropri- ate clinical setting, such as severe sepsis. Although there  is no single test for DIC, the common constellation of  findings is thrombocytopenia (<100,000/Î¼L), elevated  prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplas- tin time, evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mia, and elevated fibrin degradation productions and  d-dimer. The fibrinogen level may be <100 mg/dL but  often does not decrease acutely unless the DIC is very  severe. The primary treatment of DIC is to treat the  underlying cause, which in this case would be antibiotic  therapy directed against Neisseria meningitidis. For patients  such as this one who are experiencing bleeding related to  the DIC, attempts to correct the coagulopathy should be  undertaken. Platelet transfusions and fresh-frozen plasma  (FFP) should be given. In addition, cryoprecipitate is  indicated as the fibrinogen level is <100 mg/dL. In gen- eral, 10 U of cryoprecipitate are required for every 2 to  3 units of FFP. In acute DIC, heparin is not been dem- onstrated to be helpful and may increase bleeding.

Answer: E. Platelets.

Explanation:

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and peripheral smear are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to meningococcemia. DIC is a complex, systemic, and often progressive disorder characterized by the activation of coagulation, resulting in the formation of microthrombi in various organs and the consumption of coagulation factors and platelets.

In this case, the patient has evidence of coagulation activation, as indicated by an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and decreased fibrinogen levels. Additionally, the patient's thrombocytopenia and schistocytes on the peripheral smear are consistent with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is a common complication of DIC.

The patient requires supportive measures, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring. Intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone","
E. Platelets

Explanation:
The patient is in circulatory collapse with disseminated meningococcemia, which is a severe bacterial infection. He is hypotensive, making less than 20 mL of urine per hour, and has oozing from all IV sites and blood-tinged endotracheal secretions. His laboratory studies show thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, an INR of 3.6, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 75 seconds, and a fibrinogen level of 42 mg/dL. These findings suggest that the patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to meningococcemia.

The treatment for DIC includes supportive care, such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and oxygen, as well as specific treatments for the underlying condition causing the DIC.

51,All the following are vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagu- lation factors EXCEPT: A. Factor X B. Factor VII C. Protein C D. Protein S E. Factor VIII,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays  an essential role in hemostasis. It is absorbed in the small  intestine and stored in the liver. It serves as a cofactor in  the enzymatic carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on  prothrombin-complex proteins. The three major causes  of vitamin K deficiency are poor dietary intake, intesti- nal malabsorption, and liver disease. The prothrombin  complex proteins (factors II, VII, IX, and X and protein  C and protein S) all decrease with vitamin K deficiency.  Factor VII and protein C have the shortest half-lives  of these factors and therefore decrease first. Therefore,  vitamin K deficiency manifests with prolongation of the  prothrombin time first. With severe deficiency, the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time will be prolonged as  well. Factor VIII is not influenced by vitamin K.","

Answer: C. Protein C.

Protein C is not a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor. It is an anticoagulant protein, which is synthesized in the liver and activated by thrombin. It plays a role in the inhibition of Factor Va and Factor VIIIa, thereby inhibiting the coagulation cascade.","

52,A 31-year-old man with hemophilia A is admitted  with persistent gross hematuria. He denies recent  trauma and any history of genitourinary pathology.  The examination is unremarkable. Hematocrit is  28%. All the following are treatments for hemo- philia A EXCEPT: A. Desmopressin (DDAVP) B. Fresh-frozen plasma C. Cryoprecipitate D. Recombinant factor VIII E. Plasmapheresis,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 20) Hemophilia A results from a deficiency of  factor VIII. Replacement of factor VIII is the center- piece of treatment. Cessation of aspirin or nonsteroi- dal anti-inflammatory drugs is highly recommended.  Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains pooled plasma from  human sources. Cryoprecipitate refers to FFP that is  cooled, resulting in the precipitation of material at the  bottom of the plasma. This product contains about half  the factor VIII activity of FFP in a tenth of the volume.  Both agents are therefore reasonable treatment options.  DDAVP (desmopressin) causes the release of a number  of factors and von Willebrand factor from the liver and  endothelial cells. This may be useful for patients with  mild hemophilia. Recombinant or purified factor VIII  (i.e., Humate P) is indicated in patients with more severe  bleeding. Therapy may be required for weeks, with lev- els of factor VIII kept at 50%, for postsurgical or severe  bleeding. Plasmapheresis has no role in the treatment of  patients with hemophilia A.","

Answer: E. Plasmapheresis.

Explanation: Plasmapheresis is a procedure used for the removal of plasma from the blood, often used in the treatment of various conditions such as autoimmune disorders, toxins, and some types of hemolytic anemias. It is not a treatment for hemophilia A, which is a genetic disorder characterized by the deficiency or dysfunction of coagulation factor VIII. The correct treatments for hemophilia A include Desmopressin (DDAVP) to stimulate the release of endogenous factor VIII, Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) to provide exogenous factor VIII, Cryoprecipitate to concentrate factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, and Recombinant factor VIII to replace the missing or dysfunctional factor VIII.","
E. Plasmapheresis

Explanation: Plasmapheresis is a procedure used for the removal of plasma from a patient's bloodstream, typically used for conditions such as plasma disorders, toxins, or drug overdoses. It is not a treatment for hemophilia A, which is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII. The other options, desmopressin (DDAVP), fresh-frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate, are all used for the treatment of hemophilia A. Desmopressin stimulates the release of factor VIII from the endothelium, fresh-frozen plasma contains factor VIII, and cryoprecipitate is a concentrated source of factor VIII.",1,1
53,All of the following statements regarding the lupus  anticoagulant (LA) are true EXCEPT: A. LAs typically prolong the activated partial thrombo- plastin time. B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence  of LAs. C. Bleeding episodes in patients with LAs may be   severe and life threatening. D. Female patients may experience recurrent   midtrimester abortions. E. LAs may occur in the absence of other signs of   systemic lupus erythematosus.,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 20) Lupus anticoagulants (Las) cause prolonga- tion of coagulation tests by binding to phospholipids.  Although most often encountered in patients with sys- temic lupus erythematosus, they may also develop in  normal individuals. The diagnosis is first suggested by  prolongation of coagulation tests. Failure to correct  with incubation with normal plasma confirms the pres- ence of a circulating inhibitor. Contrary to the name,  patients with LA activity have normal hemostasis and are  not predisposed to bleeding. Instead, they are at risk for  venous and arterial thromboembolisms. Patients with a  history of recurrent unplanned abortions or thrombosis  should undergo lifelong anticoagulation. The presence  of LAs or anticardiolipin antibodies without a history  of thrombosis may be observed because many of these  patients will not go on to develop a thrombotic event.","

Answer: B. A 1:1 mixing study will correct in the presence of LAs.

Explanation: Lupus anticoagulants (LAs) are a type of antiphospholipid antibodies that interfere with the coagulation process. They prolong coagulation tests such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the Russell viper venom time (rVVT). A 1:1 mixing study is a test used to differentiate between a true coagulation disorder and a laboratory interference. In the presence of LAs, the 1:1 mixing study will not correct, meaning that the addition of normal plasma does not correct the prolonged coagulation test. Therefore, option B is incorrect.","
B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence of LAs.
Explanation:
A 1:1 mixing study is a laboratory test used to diagnose the presence of an inhibitor in a patient's plasma. In the presence of an inhibitor, the clotting time will not be corrected when the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio. However, LAs do not inhibit the clotting factors directly but rather interfere with the phospholipid surface required for clotting factor activation. Therefore, a 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence of LAs.

Therefore, the answer is B. A 1:1 mixing study will not correct in the presence of LAs.",0,0
54,All the following cause prolongation of the acti- vated partial thromboplastin time that does not  correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma  EXCEPT: A. Lupus anticoagulant B. Factor VIII inhibitor C. Heparin D. Factor VII inhibitor E. Factor IX inhibitor,"The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) The activated partial thromboplastin time  (aPTT) involves the factors of the intrinsic pathway of  coagulation. Prolongation of the aPTT reflects either a  deficiency of one of these factors (factor VIII, IX, XI,  XII, and so on) or inhibition of the activity of one of the  factors or components of the aPTT assay (i.e., phospho- lipids). This may be further characterized by the â€œmix- ing studyâ€_x009d_ in which the patientâ€™s plasma is mixed with  pooled plasma. Correction of the aPTT reflects a defi- ciency of factors that are replaced by the pooled sample.  Failure to correct the aPTT reflects the presence of a fac- tor inhibitor or phospholipid inhibitor. Common causes  of a failure to correct include the presence of heparin in  the sample, factor inhibitors (factor VIII inhibitor being  the most common), and the presence of antiphospho- lipid antibodies. Factor VII is involved in the extrinsic  pathway of coagulation. Inhibitors to factor VII would  result in prolongation of the prothrombin time.","

Answer: C. Heparin

Explanation: Heparin is an anticoagulant that directly acts on antithrombin III to enhance its inhibitory effect on thrombin and factor Xa. It does not inhibit any specific coagulation factor and does not cause a prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that does not correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma. The other options listed (A, B, D, and E) are inhibitors of specific coagulation factors and do cause a prolongation of the aPTT that does not correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma.","
C. Heparin

Explanation:
The prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that does not correct with a 1:1 mixture with pooled plasma is a hallmark of the presence of an inhibitor. The inhibitors mentioned in the query are lupus anticoagulant (LA), Factor VIII inhibitor, Factor IX inhibitor, and Factor VII inhibitor. However, heparin does not cause an inhibitor effect on the aPTT. Instead, heparin directly activates the antithrombin III, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa. Therefore, the answer is C. Heparin.",0,0

Hepatitis C RNA E. Mesenteric angiogram","The answer is D.  (Chap. 20) This patient presents with a significant upper  gastrointestinal (GI) bleed with a prolonged prothrom- bin time (PT). Hemophilia should not cause a prolonged  PT. This and the presence of ascites raise the possibility  of liver disease and cirrhosis. The contamination of blood  products in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in widespread  transmission of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) within  the hemophilia population receiving factor infusions.    Review and Self-Assessment 769 It is estimated in 2006, that >80% of hemophilia patients  older than 20 years old are infected with HCV. Viral  inactivation steps were introduced in the 1980s, and  recombinant factor VIII and IX were first produced in  the 1990s. HCV is the major cause of morbidity and  the second leading cause of death in patients exposed  to older factor concentrates. Patients develop cirrhosis  and complications that include ascites and variceal bleed- ing. End-stage liver disease requiring a liver transplant is  curative for the cirrhosis and the hemophilia (the liver  produces factor VIII). Hepatitis B was not transmitted in  significant numbers to patients with hemophilia. Diver- ticular disease or peptic ulcer disease would not explain  the prolonged PT. Patients with inadequately repleted  factor VIII levels are more likely to develop hemarthro- ses than GI bleeds, and the slightly prolonged activated  partial thromboplastin time makes this unlikely.","

Answer: E. Mesenteric angiogram.

Explanation:
The patient's history of hemarthroses and the recent factor VIII injection, along with the acute GI bleed, raises the suspicion of a complication related to the use of factor VIII, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or arterial thrombosis. Mesenteric ischemia is a known complication of DIC and can present with abdominal pain, tenderness, and GI bleeding. An angiogram would be the most appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia. Factor VIII activity level would not provide information about the cause of the GI bleeding, and Helicobacter pylori antibody test, Hepatitis B surface antigen, and Hepatitis C RNA are not related to the patient's symptoms.","E. Mesenteric angiogram.

The patient's symptoms of increasing abdominal girth, fatigue, anorexia, and a positive fluid wave suggest the presence of ascites, which is a common complication of cirrhosis. The prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio suggest the presence of liver dysfunction. Hepatitis B and C are potential causes of liver dysfunction, but the absence of other symptoms and normal renal function and urinalysis results make these less likely.

When suspecting DIC, these tests should  be repeated over a period of 6 to 8 hours because abnor- malities may change dramatically in patients with severe  DIC. In contrast, these test results should not fluctuate  as much in patients with severe liver disease. Bacterial  sepsis with positive blood cultures is a common cause of  DIC but is not diagnostic.","

Answer: E. Serial laboratory analysis.

Explanation:

The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease is by serial laboratory analysis. In chronic liver disease, there is often a persistent coagulopathy with a low platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). However, in DIC, there is an acute consumptive coagulopathy with a low platelet count, prolonged PT, and elevated fibrin degradation products (d-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products). Blood culture is used to identify an infectious cause of DIC. Elevated fibrinogen degradation products are not specific for DIC and can be seen in other conditions such as sepsis and malignancy. Prolonged aPTT is not specific for DIC and can be seen in other conditions such as liver disease and warfarin therapy.","
E. Serial laboratory analysis

Explanation:
The best way to distinguish between new-onset DIC and chronic liver disease is by serial laboratory analysis. In DIC, there is a sudden increase in fibrin degradation products, such as d-dimer, and a decrease in coagulation factors, such as fibrinogen. In chronic liver disease, these values are typically elevated due to the underlying liver dysfunction. However, in the setting of acute bleeding, such as in this case, the d-dimer level may be elevated in both DIC and chronic liver disease. Therefore, serial laboratory analysis, including repeated measurements of platelet count, INR, d-dimer, and fibrinogen, can help distinguish between the two conditions. Additionally, other laboratory tests, such as fibrinogen degradation products and prothrombin fragment F1+2, can be useful in confirming the diagnosis of DIC.

Therefore, the answer is E. Serial laboratory analysis.",1,1
57,All of the following genetic mutations are associ- ated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis  EXCEPT: A. Factor V Leiden mutation B. Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor C. Heterozygous protein C deficiency D. Prothrombin 20210G E. Tissue plasminogen activator,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 21) Venous thrombosis occurs through activation  of the coagulation cascade primarily through the expo- sure to tissue factor, and the genetic factors that contrib- ute to a predisposition to venous thrombosis typically  are polymorphisms affecting procoagulant or fibrinolytic  pathways. In contrast, arterial thrombosis occurs in the  setting a platelet activation, and the genetic predisposi- tion for arterial thrombosis includes mutations that affect  platelet receptors or redox enzymes. The most common  inherited risk factors for venous thrombosis are the factor  V Leiden mutation and prothrombin 20210 mutation.  Other mutations predisposing an individual to venous  thrombosis include inherited deficiency of protein C or  S and mutations of fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activa- tor, thrombomodulin, or plasminogen activator inhibitor.  The glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor mutation would  increase the risk of arterial, but not venous, thrombosis.","

Answer: C. Heterozygous protein C deficiency

Explanation: Heterozygous protein C deficiency is associated with a decreased risk of venous thromboembolism, not an increased risk. Protein C is an anticoagulant that inhibits factors Va and VIIIa, and its deficiency leads to a hypercoagulable state. However, the other mentioned mutations (Factor V Leiden, Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor, Prothrombin 20210G, and Tissue plasminogen activator) are all associated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis.","D. Prothrombin 20210G

Explanation:
The Factor V Leiden mutation, Glycoprotein 1b platelet receptor mutation, and Heterozygous protein C deficiency are all associated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis. The Prothrombin 20210G mutation is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, but it is not specifically a deep-vein thrombosis risk factor. Tissue plasminogen activator is a fibrinolytic agent and is not a genetic mutation associated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis.",0,0
58,"A 76-year-old man presents to an urgent care clinic  with pain in his left leg for 4 days. He also describes  swelling in his left ankle, which has made it difficult  for him to ambulate. He is an active smoker and  has a medical history remarkable for gastroesopha- geal reflux disease, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)  9 months ago that resolved, and well-controlled  hypertension. Physical examination is revealing for  2+ edema in his left ankle. A d-dimer is ordered  and is elevated. Which of the following makes  d-dimer less predictive of DVT in this patient? A. Age older than 70 years B. History of active tobacco use C. Lack of suggestive clinical symptoms D. Negative Homanâ€™s sign on examination E. Previous DVT in the past year","The answer is A.  (Chap. 21) d-Dimer is a degradation product of cross- linked fibrin and is elevated in conditions of ongoing  thrombosis. Low concentrations of d-dimer are considered  to indicate the absence of thrombosis. Patients older than  the age of 70 years frequently have elevated d-dimers  in the absence of thrombosis, making this test less pre- dictive of acute disease. Clinical symptoms are often not  present in patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)  and do not affect interpretation of a d-dimer. Tobacco  use, although frequently considered a risk factor for  DVT, and previous DVT should not affect the predic- tive value of d-dimer. Homanâ€™s sign, calf pain elicited by  dorsiflexion of the foot, is not predictive of DVT and is  unrelated to d-dimer.","

Answer: E. Previous DVT in the past year.

Explanation: The presence of a previous DVT increases the likelihood of a recurrence, making a positive d-dimer result more predictive.","
C. Lack of suggestive clinical symptoms

Explanation:
The presence of clinical symptoms, such as pain, swelling, and redness, increases the likelihood of DVT. In the absence of these symptoms, a positive d-dimer result may be less predictive of DVT. In this case, the patient has a history of DVT and is currently experiencing symptoms, but the lack of suggestive clinical symptoms would make d-dimer less predictive of DVT. However, it's important to note that a negative Homan's sign does not make d-dimer less predictive of DVT. Homan's sign is a clinical finding, and a negative result does not rule out DVT. Additionally, age, tobacco use, and previous DVT do not make d-dimer less predictive of DVT.",0,0

Check d-dimer and, if normal, obtain lower extrem- ity ultrasound. C. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, treat for deep-vein  thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. D. Check d-dimer and, if abnormal, obtain a contrast  multislice computed tomography scan of the chest. E. Obtain a contrast multislice computed tomography  scan of the chest.","The answer is E.  (Chaps. 21 and 22) The clinical probability of pulmonary  embolism (pulmonary embolism) can be delineated into  low to high likelihood using the clinical decision rule  shown in Table 22-1. In those with a score of 3 or less,  pulmonary embolism is low or moderately likely, and a  d-dimer test should be performed. A normal d-dimer  result combined with a low to moderate clinical prob- ability of pulmonary embolism identifies patients who  do not need further testing or anticoagulation therapy.  Those with either a likely clinical probability (score >3)  or an abnormal d-dimer (with unlikely clinical probabil- ity) require an imaging test to rule out pulmonary embo- lism. Currently, the most attractive imaging method to  detect pulmonary embolism is the multislice computed  tomography (CT). It is accurate and, if the result is nor- mal, safely rules out pulmonary embolism. This patient  has a clinical probability score of 4.5 because of her rest- ing tachycardia and the lack of an alternative diagnosis at  least as likely as pulmonary embolism. Therefore, there is  no indication for measuring d-dimer, and she should pro- ceed directly to multislice CT of the chest. If this cannot  be performed expeditiously, she should receive one dose  of low-molecular-weight heparin while awaiting the test.","

Answer: B. Check d-dimer and, if normal, obtain lower extremity ultrasound.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and risk factors (smoking, oral contraceptive use) suggest a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). However, her vital signs and initial test results (normal chest X-ray and complete blood count) are not definitive for PE. A d-dimer test is a sensitive but nonspecific marker for thromboembolic disease. If the d-dimer result is normal, the likelihood of DVT or PE is low, and further testing with lower extremity ultrasound is recommended to rule out DVT. If the d-dimer result is abnormal, further testing with imaging studies (such as CT scan or ventilation-perfusion scan) is indicated.","
B. Check d-dimer and, if normal, obtain lower extremity ultrasound.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and tachypnea, along with a normal chest radiograph and negative pregnancy test, suggest a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that is often elevated in patients with DVT or PE. A negative d-dimer result would make PE or DVT less likely, and a lower extremity ultrasound would be the next step to evaluate for DVT. If the d-dimer result is abnormal, a contrast multislice computed tomography scan of the chest would be the next step to evaluate for PE. However, given the normal chest radiograph and negative pregnancy test, it is more likely that the d-dimer result will be normal, making option B the most appropriate management strategy.",0,0
60,All of the anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs listed  are correctly matched with their mechanisms of  action EXCEPT: A. Abciximabâ€”Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor   inhibitor B. Clopidogrelâ€”Adenosine diphosphate receptor  blockade C. Enoxaparinâ€”Direct thrombin inhibition D. Rivaroxabanâ€”Factor Xa inhibition E. Warfarinâ€”Inhibition of production of the vitamin  Kâ€“dependent clotting factors,"The answer is C.  (Chap. 23) In recent years, a variety of new anticoagulant  and antiplatelet drugs have been developed for clinical use.   Platelets play an important role in arterial thrombosis,  particularly in coronary artery and cerebrovascular dis- ease. Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet drug  worldwide. Aspirin exerts its effects through inhibition of  cyclooxygenase-1. Other commonly used oral antiplatelet  agents are clopidogrel and dipyridamole. Clopidogrel is in  a class of agents called thienopyridines along with ticlopi- dine. Thienopyridines act to block a specific adenosine  diphosphate receptor (P2Y12) and inhibit platelet aggrega- tion. Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase to decrease  the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate  (cAMP) to decrease platelet aggregation. Intravenous  antiplatelet agents have also become increasingly impor- tant in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. All of  the intravenous agents act to inhibit platelet aggregation  by blocking the glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa receptor. The   Review and Self-Assessment 770 three agents in clinical use as Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors are  abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban.  Anticoagulant agents are primarily used for the preven- tion and treatment of venous thrombosis. Many antico- agulants are available and act by a variety of mechanisms.  Heparin has been used for many years but requires frequent  monitoring to be used safely. More recently, low-molec- ular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been introduced.  These agents are given subcutaneously and generally pre- ferred in many instances over heparin given a more predict- able anticoagulant effect. Both heparin and the LMWHs  are indirect thrombin inhibitors that act primarily through  activation of antithrombin. When activated, antithrombin  inhibits clotting enzymes, especially thrombin and factor  Xa. Fondaparinux is a newer anticoagulant that inhibits  only factor Xa, although it is a synthetic analogue of the  pentasaccharide sequence in heparin that binds antithrom- bin. However, it is too short to bridge antithrombin to  thrombin. The direct thrombin inhibitors bind directly to  thrombin (rather than antithrombin) to exert their activ- ity. The direct thrombin inhibitors include lepirudin, arg- atroban, and bivalirudin. The most commonly used oral  anticoagulant is warfarin, which inhibits the production  of vitamin Kâ€“dependent clotting factors. Given the need  for frequent monitoring and extensive drug interactions,  developing other oral anticoagulants that are safe and effec- tive has been desired for many years. No oral drug has yet  been introduced into the market. However, several are in  the final stages of development. These include two factor  Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and one factor IIa  inhibitor (dabigatran etexilate).","

Answer: A. Abciximab—Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor

Explanation: Abciximab is an integrin receptor antagonist, specifically targeting the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. It does not inhibit the production of clotting factors or act as a direct thrombin inhibitor.","
E. Warfarinâ€”Inhibition of production of the vitamin  Kâ€“dependent clotting factors

Explanation:
Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that inhibits the activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) by interfering with their synthesis. Therefore, option E is incorrect, as it states that warfarin inhibits the production of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors instead of their activity.",0,0
61,"A 66-year-old woman is prescribed clopidogrel  and aspirin after implantation of a bare metal stent  in her right coronary artery. Two weeks after the  procedure, the woman presents to the emergency  department with acute-onset chest pain and elec- trocardiographic changes consistent with an acute  inferior myocardial infarction. Emergent cardiac  catheterization confirms in-stent restenosis. The  patient insists she has been adherent to her pre- scribed therapy. Which of the following state- ments most correctly described the most likely  cause of the patientâ€™s restenosis despite her current  therapy? A. She likely has aspirin resistance and should be treated  with higher doses of aspirin to prevent a recurrence. B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a  genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway. C. She should have been treated with low-molecular- weight heparin to prevent this complication. D. She should have been treated with warfarin to pre- vent this complication. E. Because she has demonstrated resistance to clopido- grel, switching to prasugrel would not be useful to  prevent further complications.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) After implantation of a bare metal coronary  artery stent, aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended  for at least 4 weeks to decrease the risk of in-stent reste- nosis. This patient, however, developed the complica- tion despite adherence to her therapy. This generally  suggests resistance to clopidogrel with a decreased ability  of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregation. There is  a known genetic component to clopidogrel resistance  related to specific genetic polymorphisms of the CYP  isoenzymes. Up to 25% of whites, 30% of African Amer- icans, and 50% of Asians may carry an allele that renders  them resistant to clopidogrel. These polymorphisms are  less important in the activation of prasugrel. Thus, in  individuals who have evidence of clopidogrel resistance,  switching to prasugrel should be considered.  Aspirin resistance is a more controversial subject. It  is defined simply in clinical terms as failure of aspirin to  prevent ischemic vascular events. Biochemically, aspirin  resistance can be defined by failure of usual doses of the  drug to produce inhibitory effects on platelet function.  However, resistance to aspirin is not reversed by higher  doses of aspirin or adding another antiplatelet agent.  Because the primary mechanism of arterial thrombosis  is platelet aggregation, the anticoagulant agents warfarin  and low-molecular-weight heparin are not indicated.","

Answer: B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway.","
B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of acute-on-set chest pain and electrocardiographic changes consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction despite being on dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) suggests a complication, such as in-stent restenosis. The most likely cause of this complication in this scenario is clopidogrel resistance, which is a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway that affects the metabolism of clopidogrel and reduces its efficacy. This is the most likely explanation for the patient's restenosis despite her current therapy.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. She likely has clopidogrel resistance caused by a genetic polymorphism of the CYP pathway.

The other options are incorrect:
A. Aspirin resistance is a condition where the body does not respond properly to aspirin, leading to increased platelet aggregation. It is not the most likely cause of the patient's",1,1
62,"A 48-year-old woman is diagnosed with a deep- vein thrombosis of her left lower extremity. When  considering initial anticoagulant therapy, all of the  following are advantages of low-molecular-weight  heparins over heparin EXCEPT: A. Better bioavailability B. Dose-dependent clearance C. Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection D. Lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia E. Predictable anticoagulant effect","The answer is B.  (Chap. 23) Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs)  have largely replaced heparin for most indications if a  patient does not have any contraindications to therapy.  LMWHs have better bioavailability and longer half-lives  after subcutaneous injection. Thus, they can be given at  routine intervals for both prophylaxis and treatment. In  addition, dosing of LMWHs is simplified because these  drugs have a dose-independent clearance, and predict- able anticoagulant effects means that monitoring of anti- coagulant effect is not required in most patients. Finally,  LMWHs have a lower risk of heparin-induced throm- bocytopenia, which is important in both short- and  long-term administration.","

Answer: C. Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection

Explanation: Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have several advantages over unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These advantages include better bioavailability after subcutaneous injection, dose-dependent clearance, longer half-life, and a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, LMWHs do not have a longer half-life after subcutaneous injection compared to UFH. In fact, LMWHs have a shorter half-life than UFH, but their predictable anticoagulant effect makes them easier to dose and monitor. UFH, on the other hand, requires frequent monitoring due to its variable anticoagulant effect and shorter half-life.","
C. Longer half-life after subcutaneous injection

Explanation: Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have a longer half-life after subcutaneous injection compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH), making them more convenient for once or twice daily dosing. This is an advantage over heparin. Therefore, option C is incorrect.",0,0

A 56-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for  breast cancer D. A 62-year-old man who underwent hip replacement  surgery 4 weeks previously E. A 72-year-old man who had an acute myocardial  infarction 2 weeks ago,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) The d-dimer measured by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is elevated in the setting  of breakdown of fibrin by plasmin, and the presence of  a positive d-dimer can prompt the need for additional  imaging for deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary  embolus in specific clinical situations in which the patient  would be considered to have an elevation in d-dimer.  However, one must be cautious about placing value on  an elevated d-dimer in other situations when there can  be an alternative explanation for the elevated level. Of  the scenarios listed in the question, the only patient who  would be expected to have a negative d-dimer result  would be the patient with calf pain and recent air travel.  The presence of a normal alveolarâ€“arterial oxygen gradi- ent cannot reliably differentiate between those with and  without pulmonary embolism. In all the other scenarios,  elevations in d-dimer could be related to other medi- cal conditions and provide no diagnostic information  to inform the clinician regarding the need for further  evaluation. Some common clinical situations in which  the d-dimer is elevated include sepsis, myocardial infarc- tion, cancer, pneumonia, the postoperative state, and the  second and third trimesters of pregnancy.","

Answer: B, C, and D.

Explanation:

A positive d-dimer result in isolation is not sufficient to diagnose a pulmonary embolus (PE), but it can be a useful marker to suggest the possibility of PE, particularly in patients with clinical suspicion. However, the pretest probability of PE is crucial in determining the utility of d-dimer testing.

In the given scenario, the following patients have a higher pretest probability of PE and would benefit from further evaluation if they have a positive d-dimer result:

1. A 48-year-old man with calf pain following prolonged air travel: This patient has a known risk factor for PE (prolonged immobility during travel) and presents with a symptom (calf pain) that may be related to PE.
2. A 56-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer: Cancer and its treatment, such as chemotherapy, are well-known risk factors for PE.
3. A 62-year-old man who underwent hip replacement surgery 4 weeks previously: This patient is at increased risk for PE due to the","
B. A 48-year-old man with no medical history who presents with calf pain following prolonged air travel; the alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient is normal.

Explanation:
A positive d-dimer level is a common finding in pregnancy due to the hypercoagulable state. Therefore, a positive d-dimer in a pregnant woman (A) would not necessarily indicate a pulmonary embolus and additional testing would be required to confirm the diagnosis.

The man in option B has no medical history but presents with calf pain following prolonged air travel and a normal alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient. This constellation of symptoms and findings is concerning for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE). A positive d-dimer in this case would prompt further testing for DVT and PE.

The other patients in the options do not have symptoms or findings suggestive of PE, and their medical histories do not increase their risk for PE. Therefore, a positive d-dimer in these cases would not necessarily indicate PE and additional testing would not be required.

64,A 62-year-old woman is hospitalized following  an acute pulmonary embolism. All of the follow- ing would typically indicate a massive pulmonary  embolism EXCEPT: A. Elevated serum troponin levels B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis C. Initial presentation with syncope D. Presence of right ventricular enlargement on CT  scan of the chest E. Presence of right ventricular hypokinesis on   echocardiogram,"The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) Clinically, individuals with massive pulmonary  embolus present with hypotension, syncope, or cyanosis.  The hypotension and syncope occur due to acute right ven- tricular overload, and elevated troponin or amino terminal   (NT)-pro-brain natriuretic peptide can result from this  right ventricular strain. Both elevated troponin and NT- pro-brain natriuretic peptide predict worse outcomes in  pulmonary embolism. Further prognostic signs of massive  pulmonary embolism include the presence of right ventric- ular enlargement on computed tomography of the chest  or right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiography.   The presence of hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, or   Review and Self-Assessment 771 cough in association with pulmonary embolism most  commonly indicates a small peripheral lesion.","

Answer: B. Initial presentation with hemoptysis.

Explanation: Hemoptysis is a common symptom of pulmonary embolism, and its presence does not exclude the diagnosis. However, massive pulmonary embolism is typically characterized by acute shortness of breath, chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of right heart failure, such as jugular vein distention, peripheral edema, and hepatomegaly. Elevated serum troponin levels, right ventricular enlargement on CT scan, right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram, and syncope are all consistent with a massive pulmonary embolism.","C. Initial presentation with syncope.

Explanation: Syncope is a common symptom in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, and its presence does not necessarily indicate a massive pulmonary embolism. However, the other symptoms listed, such as elevated serum troponin levels, hemoptysis, right ventricular enlargement on CT scan, and right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram, are more indicative of a massive pulmonary embolism.",1,0

Multidetector-row spiral CT imaging is suboptimal  for detecting small peripheral emboli, necessitating  the use of invasive pulmonary angiography. E. None of the routinely used imaging techniques  provide adequate evaluation of the right ventricle to  assist in risk stratification of the patient.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 22) For many years, ventilationâ€“perfusion imag- ing (V-Q) was the standard for the diagnosis of pulmo- nary embolism (pulmonary embolism). Determination of  abnormal V-Q imaging can be difficult. To call a V-Q  scan a high-probability scan, one needs to see two or more  segmental perfusion defects in the setting of normal venti- lation. In patients with underlying lung disease, however,  ventilation is frequently abnormal, and most patients with  pulmonary embolism do not actually have high-probabil- ity V-Q scans. When there is a high-probability V-Q scan,  the likelihood of pulmonary embolism is 90% or greater.  Alternatively, patients with normal perfusion imaging  have a very low likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Most  patients fall into either the low or intermediate probabil- ity of having a pulmonary embolism by V-Q imaging.  In this setting, 40% of patients with a high clinical suspi- cion of pulmonary embolism are determined by pulmo- nary angiography to indeed have a pulmonary embolism  despite having a low-probability V-Q scan. At the present  time, V-Q scanning is largely supplanted by multidetec- tor-row spiral computed tomography (CT) angiography  of the chest. Compared with conventional CT scanning  with intravenous contrast, the multidetector spiral CT can  provide evaluation of the pulmonary arteries to the sixth- order branches, a level of resolution that is as good as or  exceeds that of conventional invasive pulmonary angiog- raphy. In addition, the CT allows evaluation of the right  and left ventricles as well as the lung parenchyma to pro- vide additional information regarding prognosis in acute  pulmonary embolism or alternative diagnosis in the patient  with dyspnea. Magnetic resonance angiography is a rarely  used alternative to the above modalities in patients with  contrast dye allergy. This technique provides the ability to  detect large proximal PEs but lacks reliability for segmental  and subsegmental pulmonary embolism.","

Treat with dopamine and recombinant tissue plas- minogen activator, 100 mg IV.","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) This patient is presenting with massive pul- monary embolus (pulmonary embolism) with ongoing  hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and profound  hypoxemia requiring 100% oxygen. In this setting, con- tinuing with anticoagulation alone is inadequate, and  the patient should receive circulatory support with fibri- nolysis if there are no contraindications to therapy. The  major contraindications to fibrinolysis include hyperten- sion >180/110 mm Hg, known intracranial disease or  prior hemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery, or trauma. The  recommended fibrinolytic regimen is recombinant tissue   plasminogen activator (rTPA), 100 mg IV over 2 hours.  Heparin should be continued with the fibrinolytic to pre- vent a rebound hypercoagulable state with dissolution of the  clot. There is a 10% risk of major bleeding with fibrinolytic  therapy, with a 1â€“3% risk of intracranial hemorrhage.   The only indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolism  is for massive pulmonary embolism presenting with life- threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and  refractory hypoxemia. In submassive pulmonary embolism  presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of  right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the deci- sion to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case basis.  In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive  circulatory support with vasopressors. Dopamine and  dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treat- ment of shock in pulmonary embolism. Caution should be  taken with ongoing high-volume fluid administration, as  a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly toler- ant of additional fluids. Ongoing fluids may worsen right  ventricular ischemia and further dilate the right ventricle,  displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen  cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contra- indications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized  with vasopressor support, referral for surgical embolec- tomy should be considered. Referral for inferior vena cava  filter placement is not indicated at this time. The patient  should be stabilized hemodynamically as a first priority.  The indications for inferior vena cava filter placement are  active bleeding, precluding anticoagulation, and recurrent  deep-vein thrombosis on adequate anticoagulation.","

Answer: C. Refer for inferior vena cava filter placement and continue current management.

The patient's presentation of syncope, shortness of breath, and tachycardia with a positive Homan's sign and a saddle pulmonary embolus on imaging are indicative of a high-risk PE with hemodynamic instability. The patient's low blood pressure and hypoxia despite oxygen supplementation further support this. The echocardiogram showing hypokinesis of the right ventricle is also consistent with right heart strain from the PE.

Given the patient's history of antiphospholipid syndrome and nonadherence to anticoagulation therapy, there is a high risk of recurrent PE. The patient's current management with unfractionated heparin and fluid resuscitation is appropriate for acute PE, but additional measures are needed to prevent further clot propagation and embolization.

Option A, continuing the current management alone, is not sufficient as the patient remains hemodynamically unstable and at high risk for further clotting. Option B, continuing IV fluids at","
C. Refer for inferior vena cava filter placement and continue current management.

Explanation:
The patient is experiencing a saddle pulmonary embolus with ongoing clot in the pelvic veins on the left, which is causing right ventricular hypokinesis and low blood pressure. Given her history of antiphospholipid syndrome and nonadherence to anticoagulation medication, there is a high risk of recurrent thromboembolic events. The current management with unfractionated heparin is appropriate to prevent further clotting, but additional measures are needed to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism and potential cardiac complications. Inferior vena cava filter placement is a reasonable option to prevent further clot propagation and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism while the patient's anticoagulation therapy takes effect. Surgical embolectomy is an invasive procedure with risks and should be considered as a last resort when other measures have failed or when the patient's condition is deteriorating rapidly. Dopamine and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator are not indicated in this scenario as they are used",0,0
67,"A 42-year-old woman presents to the emergency  department with acute onset of shortness of breath.  She recently had been to visit her parents out of state  and rode in a car for about 9 hours each way. Two  days ago, she developed mild calf pain and swelling,  but she thought that this was not unusual after having  been sitting with her legs dependent for the recent  trip. On arrival to the emergency department, she is  noted to be tachypneic. The vital signs are as follows:     blood pressure of 98/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 114  beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, oxygen  saturation of 92% on room air, and weight of 89 kg.  The lungs are clear bilaterally. There is pain in the  right calf with dorsiflexion of the foot, and the right  leg is more swollen compared with the left. An arterial  blood gas measurement shows a pH of 7.52, PCO2 25  mm Hg, and PO2 68 mm Hg. Kidney and liver func- tion are normal. A helical CT scan confirms a pulmo- nary embolus. All of the following agents can be used  alone as initial therapy in this patient EXCEPT: A. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC twice daily B. Fondaparinux 7.5 mg SC once daily C. Tinzaparin 175 U/kg SC once daily D. Unfractionated heparin IV adjusted to maintain  activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two to  three times the upper limit of normal E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2â€“3  Review and Self-Assessment 739","The answer is E. (Chap. 22) Warfarin should not be used alone as ini- tial therapy for the treatment of venous thromboem- bolic disease (VTE) for two reasons. First, warfarin does  not achieve full anticoagulation for at least 5 days, as its  mechanism of action is to decrease the production of  vitamin Kâ€“dependent coagulation factors in the liver.  Second, a paradoxical reaction that promotes coagu- lation may also occur upon initiation of warfarin as it  also decreases the production of the vitamin Kâ€“depen- dent anticoagulants protein C and protein S, which  have shorter half-lives than the procoagulant factors.  For many years, unfractionated heparin delivered intra- venously was the treatment of choice for VTE. How- ever, it requires frequent monitoring of activated partial  thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels and hospitalization  until therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR)  is achieved with warfarin. There are now several safe  and effective alternatives to unfractionated heparin that  can be delivered SC. Low-molecular-weight heparins  (enoxaparin, tinzaparin) are fragments of unfraction- ated heparin with a lower molecular weight. These  compounds have a greater bioavailability, longer half- life, and more predictable onset of action. Their use in  renal insufficiency should be considered with  caution  because low-molecular-weight heparins are renally  cleared. Fondaparinux is a direct factor Xa inhibitor   that, like low-molecular-weight heparins, requires no   Review and Self-Assessment 772 monitoring of anticoagulant effects and has been demon- strated to be safe and effective in treating both deep-vein  thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.","

Answer: E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2–3.

Explanation: Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that takes several days to reach therapeutic levels. It is not appropriate for initial therapy in a patient with acute PE due to the delay in achieving therapeutic anticoagulation. Enoxaparin, fondaparinux, and tinzaparin are all low molecular weight heparins that can be used for initial therapy in PE. These agents have a more rapid onset of action and can be administered subcutaneously. Unfractionated heparin can also be used for initial therapy, but it requires continuous intravenous administration and monitoring of aPTT.","E. Warfarin 7.5 mg PO once daily to maintain INR at 2–3

Explanation:
Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that requires several days to reach therapeutic levels and is not appropriate for initial therapy in a patient with acute pulmonary embolism. The other options listed are all anticoagulants that can be used for initial therapy in this setting. Enoxaparin, fondaparinux, and tinzaparin are all low molecular weight heparins, while unfractionated heparin is a traditional heparin preparation. All of these agents can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously and have rapid onset of action.",1,1
68,"In general, which of the following is the greatest  risk factor for the development of cancer? A. Age B. Alcohol use C. Cigarette smoking D. Female sex E. Obesity","The answer is A.  (Chap. 26) Although cigarette smoking is the greatest  modifiable risk factor for the development of cancer, the  most significant risk factor for cancer in general is age.  Two-thirds of all cancers are diagnosed in individuals  older than 65 years, and the risk of developing cancer  between the ages of 60 and 79 years is one in three in  men and one in five in women. In contrast, the risk of  cancer between birth and age 49 years is one in 70 for  boys and men and one in 48 for girls and women. Over- all, men have a slightly greater risk of developing cancer  than women (44% vs 38% lifetime risk).","

A. Age. Age is the greatest risk factor for the development of cancer.

69,"Among women younger than 60 years of age who  die from cancer, which of the following is the most  common primary organ of origin? A. Breast B. Cervix C. Colon D. Bone marrow E. Lung","The answer is A.  (Chap. 26) The cause of cancer death differs across the life  span. In women who are younger than 20 years of age,  the largest cause of cancer death is leukemia. Between the  ages of 20 and 59 years, breast cancer becomes the leading  cause of cancer death. However, lung cancer is the lead- ing cause of cancer death after the age of 60 years and is  overall the number one cause of cancer death in women.","

Answer: A. Breast.

Explanation: According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. It is estimated that in 2021, about 78,000 women in the US will die from breast cancer. In contrast, the number of deaths from cervical, colon, bone marrow, and lung cancers combined is lower than the number of breast cancer deaths.","A. Breast.

Explanation: According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. In 2020, it is estimated that about 154,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed, and approximately 50,000 women will die from the disease. In contrast, the number of deaths from cervical, colon, bone marrow, and lung cancers combined is lower than the number of breast cancer deaths. Therefore, the answer is A. Breast.",1,1
70,"A 68-year-old woman is diagnosed with stage II breast  cancer. She has a history of severe chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease with an FEV1 of 32% predicted,  coronary artery disease with prior stenting of the left  anterior descending artery, peripheral vascular disease,  and obesity. She continues to smoke 1 to 2 packs  of cigarettes every day. She requires oxygen at 2 L/ min continuously and is functionally quite limited.  She currently is able to attend to all of her activities  of daily living, including showering and dressing. She  retired from her work as a waitress 10 years previously  because of her lung disease. At home, she does attend  to some of the household chores but is not able to  use a vacuum. She goes out once or twice weekly  to run typical errands and drives. She feels short of  breath with most of these activities and often uses a  motorized chair when out and about. How would  you categorize her performance status and prognosis  for treatment taking this into consideration? A. She has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) grade of 1 and has a good prognosis with  appropriate therapy. B. She has an ECOG grade of 2 and has a good prog- nosis with appropriate therapy. C. She has an ECOG grade of 3 and has a good prog- nosis with appropriate therapy. D. She has an ECOG grade of 3 and has a poor progno- sis despite therapy. E. She has an ECOG grade of 4 and has a poor progno- sis that precludes therapy.","The answer is B.  (Chap. 26) Although tumor burden is certainly a major  factor in determining cancer outcomes, it is also important  to consider the functional status of the patient when con- sidering the therapeutic plan. The physiologic stresses of  undergoing surgical interventions, radiation therapy, and  chemotherapy can exhaust the limited reserves of a patient  with multiple medical problems. It is clearly difficult to  adequately measure the physiologic reserves of a patient,  and most oncologists use performance status measures as a  surrogate. Two of the most commonly used measures of  performance status are the Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky performance status. The  ECOG scale provides a grade between 0 (fully active) and  5 (dead). Most patients are considered to have adequate  reserve for undergoing treatment if the performance sta- tus is 0 to 2, with a grade 2 indicating someone who is  ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable carry out  work activities. These individuals are up and about >50%  of waking hours. A grade 3 performance score indicates  someone who is capable of only limited self-care and is  confined to a bed or chair >50% of waking hours. The  Karnofsky score ranges from 0 (dead) to 100 (normal) and  is graded at 10-point intervals. A Karnofsky score of <70  also indicates someone with poor performance status.","

Answer: D. She has an ECOG grade of 3 and has a poor prognosis despite therapy.

Explanation: The patient's significant comorbidities, including severe COPD, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, and smoking history, make her functionally limited and require the use of oxygen continuously. She is unable to perform many activities of daily living, including vacuuming, and requires a motorized chair when out and about. These factors suggest a poor performance status (ECOG grade 3), which is associated with a poorer prognosis, despite appropriate therapy.","D. She has an ECOG grade of 3 and has a poor prognosis despite therapy.

Explanation:
The patient's functional status, as described, indicates that she has significant impairment in her ability to perform basic activities of daily living and is limited in her ability to carry out even light housework or errands. This level of functional impairment is consistent with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3, which indicates ""moderate disability."" Patients with an ECOG performance status of 3 have a poorer prognosis compared to those with a better performance status, as they are more likely to experience disease progression and have a greater risk of treatment-related complications. However, it is important to note that appropriate therapy can still be beneficial for this patient, as indicated in the answer choice.",0,0

72,"Which of the following statements regarding cur- rent understanding of the genetic changes that must  occur for a cell to become cancerous is TRUE? A. Caretaker genes determine when a cell enters into a  replicative phase and must acquire mutations to   allow unregulated cell growth. B. For a cell to become cancerous, it is estimated that a  minimum of 20 mutations must occur. C. For a tumor suppressor gene to become inactivated  and allow unregulated cell growth, both copies of  the gene must have mutations. D. Oncogenes act in an autosomal recessive fashion. E. Within a cancer, there are generally two to five cells  of origin.","The answer is C.  (Chap. 24) Cancer occurs when a single cell acquires a  series of genetic mutations that allow the cell to prolifer- ate without regulation. The clonal nature of cancer is a  key feature that allows a malignancy to be differentiated  from hyperplasia, in which polyclonality is seen. Sig- nificant research has occurred over the past decades that  allows us to understand the genetic causes of cancer in  greater detail, and new research is providing a growing  knowledge of cancer of any number of cell types with  the hopes that future therapies can be personalized to  the mutations that are present in the individual cancer.  Based on laboratory research, it is thought that five to 10  mutations are needed for a cell to transform into a malig- nant cancer, although often many more mutations can  be seen. The major genes involved in cancer are onco- genes and tumor-suppressor genes. Both of these types  of genes contribute to the malignant phenotype by lead- ing to unregulated cell division or the ability to avoid  programmed cell death. Oncogenes require only a single  mutation to become activated and act in an autosomal  dominant fashion. In contrast, tumor-suppressor genes  require both copies of the allele to become inactivated  to lose their protective effects against unregulated cell  growth. Caretaker genes are a subset of tumor-suppressor   genes and have no direct effect on cell growth. These  genes function to help the cell protect the integrity of its  genome by repairing DNA defects that occur.","

73,All the following conditions are associated with an  increased incidence of cancer EXCEPT: A. Down syndrome B. Fanconiâ€™s anemia C. von Hippelâ€“Lindau syndrome D. Neurofibromatosis E. Fragile X syndrome,"The answer is E.  (Chap. 24) A small proportion of cancers occur in  patients with a genetic predisposition. Roughly 100  syndromes of familial cancer have been reported. Rec- ognition allows for genetic counseling and increased  cancer surveillance. Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is  characterized clinically by a variety of features, including  moderate to severe learning disability, facial and muscu- loskeletal deformities, duodenal atresia, congenital heart  defects, and an increased risk of acute leukemia. Fanco- niâ€™s anemia is a condition that is associated with defects in  DNA repair. There is a higher incidence of cancer, with  leukemia and myelodysplasia being the most common  cancers. von Hippelâ€“Lindau syndrome is associated with  hemangioblastomas, renal cysts, pancreatic cysts and car- cinomas, and renal cell cancer. Neurofibromatosis (NF)  types I and II are both associated with increased tumor  formation. NF II is more associated with schwannoma.   Review and Self-Assessment 773 Both carry a risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath  tumors. Fragile X is a condition associated with chromo- somal instability of the X chromosome. These patients  have mental retardation; typical morphologic features,  including macro-orchidism and prognathia; behavioral  problems; and occasionally seizures. Increased cancer  incidence has not been described.","

Answer: C. von Hippel–Lindau syndrome

Explanation:
von Hippel–Lindau syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumors in various organs, including the central nervous system, retina, pancreas, and kidneys. Individuals with this condition have an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. von Hippel–Lindau syndrome. The other conditions listed, Down syndrome, Fanconi's anemia, Neurofibromatosis, and Fragile X syndrome, are all associated with an increased risk of cancer.","
A. Down syndrome

Explanation:
Down syndrome is not an increased risk factor for cancer. In fact, people with Down syndrome have a lower risk of developing solid tumors compared to the general population. However, they have an increased risk of developing leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).",0,0
